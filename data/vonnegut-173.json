She was a registered nurse like my first wife Dorothy, but had given up that profession because doctors, she said, treated her like an idiot and a slave. Also: the hours were long and the pay was low, and she had an orphaned niece to support and keep company.\nHer art appreciation teacher showed slides of famous pictures, and two of these were of \u201cWindsor Blue Number Seventeen,\u201d before and after it fell apart.\n\u201cHow can I thank him?\u201d I said.\n\u201cI think he was trying to lighten up the course,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rest of it was so serious.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want the canvases or not?\u201d she said. There was a long silence, so she finally said, \u201cHello? Hello?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cThat may seem like a simple question to you, but it\u2019s a biggie to me.

The heroine urges the hero to flee with the Grail, before he becomes unworthy of it. The hero vows to flee without the Grail, leaving the heroine worthy of continuing to guard it.\n\u201cThe hero makes their decision for them,\u201d said Wirtanen, \u201csince they have both become impure in thought. The Holy Grail disappears. And, stunned by this unanswerable proof of their depravity, the two lovers confirm what they firmly believe to be their damnation with a tender night of love.\n\u201cThe next morning, confident of hell-fire, they promise to give each other so much joy in life that hell-fire will be a very cheap price to pay. The Holy Grail thereupon appears to them, signifying that Heaven does not despise love like theirs.
