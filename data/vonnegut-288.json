It is called Palm Sunday, is about 400 pages in manuscript, and will be brought out by Dell next spring. Under my contract with Dell, I still owe them two more novels. One is in progress, with the working title Katmandu. It is about a kid who kills a housewife in a gun accident when he is only eleven. The event shapes the rest of his life. The father is a gun-collector, as was mine.\nAs for your own career: your destiny reveals itself day-by-day, and there will come a time soon when you can look back and see almost all of it. Such is my case. You were evidently intended to be an absolutely first-rate teacher and scholar at a second rate university, which, in my opinion, is the highest rank anyone could hope to hold in this particular society.

They were also wary about making fools of themselves by buying anything. I enclose a page from the October Horizon. Almost all of the 55 pictures for sale were on 14\u2033 by 17\u2033 calligraphy bond, the same thick, 100% rag stuff used for diplomas now. The price for that size was and remains $400.00. There were a couple of much bigger ones for $1000.00, and five littler ones for $200.00. We sold twenty-one in all. Most were heads. A few were still-lifes and nudes. The gallery continues to show what\u2019s left. I\u2019ll have another show in a couple of years. I really tried to make wonderful pictures.
