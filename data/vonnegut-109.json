I\u2019m just as glad they haven\u2019t consulted me about the tiresome details. What they have worked out is this: I awake at 5:30, work until 8:00, eat breakfast at home, work until 10:00, walk a few blocks into town, do errands, go to the nearby municipal swimming pool, which I have all to myself, and swim for half an hour, return home at 11:45, read the mail, eat lunch at noon. In the afternoon I do schoolwork, either teach or prepare. When I get home from school at about 5:30, I numb my twanging intellect with several belts of Scotch and water ($5.00/fifth at the State Liquor store, the only liquor store in town. There are loads of bars, though.), cook supper, read and listen to jazz (lots of good music on the radio here), slip off to sleep at ten. I do pushups and sit-ups all the time, and feel as though I am getting lean and sinewy, but maybe not. Last night, time and my body decided to take me to the movies. I saw The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which I took very hard. To an unmoored, middle-aged man like myself, it was heart-breaking. That\u2019s all right. I like to have my heart broken.\nMy enormous Form of Fiction class, which has grown to about 80 students, and which is still growing, thanks to late registrants, is being broken up into two sections (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d\u2014what else?), each meeting for two hours once a week. \u201cA\u201d meets from 3:30 until 5:30 on Tuesday, and \u201cB\u201d meets at the same time on Wednesday. So, from Wednesday at 5:30 until Monday at 4:30, when my workshop meets, I have nothing to teach. This may seem like a remarkably soft schedule, tailored to the airy needs of a writer in residence, but it is actually a little heavier than the schedules of most of the regular English staff. Allan Vestal, an old Shortridge friend who is a full professor in the Law School, teaches only four hours a week, and his classes are much smaller than mine.\nI have incidentally changed the name of my course, since I am the only one teaching it, to Form and Texture of Fiction. Hi ho. It\u2019s going pretty well. At our first meeting, the students were bitter about the hugeness of the class. They\u2019re somewhat mollified by its being divided up, and I\u2019m starting to get some friendly playback. They\u2019re starting to catch on that Mr. Vonnegut can be funny. That\u2019s the only thing I know how to be, and of course never got a chance to be funny in Barnstable. You\u2019ve got to take the goods with the bads.\nAnyway, as you can see: when you come out here for your first visit, we can go to Chicago (six hours by car), or do anything we damn please after class on Wednesday. If you are as interested in sex as you say you are, there is a really lovely book about it in my study\u2014on a top shelf. It\u2019s red, and it\u2019s called The ABZ of Love.\nLove from A to Z\u2014\nK\nP.S.

["Teachers in public schools across the land, I hear, say Kilgore\u2019s Creed to students after the students have recited the Pledge of Allegiance and the Lord\u2019s Prayer at the beginning of each school day. Teachers say it seems to help.\nA friend told me he was at a wedding where the minister said at the climax of the ceremony: \u201cYou were sick, but now you\u2019re well again, and there\u2019s work to do. I now pronounce you man and wife.\u201d\nAnother friend, a biochemist for a cat food company, said she was staying at a hotel in Toronto, Canada, and she asked the front desk to give her a wake-up call in the morning. She answered her phone the next morning, and the operator said, \u201cYou were sick, but now you\u2019re well again, and there\u2019s work to do. It\u2019s seven a.m., and the temperature outside is thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit, or zero Celsius.\u201d\nOn the afternoon of February 13th, 2001, alone, and then during the next two weeks or so, Kilgore\u2019s Creed did as much to save life on Earth as Einstein\u2019s E equals mc squared had done to end it two generations earlier.\nTrout had Dudley Prince say the magic words to the other two armed guards on the day shift at the Academy. They went into the former Museum of the American Indian, and said them to the catatonic bums in there. A goodly number of the aroused sacred cattle, maybe a third of them, became anti-PTA evangelists in turn. Armed with nothing more than Kilgore\u2019s Creed, these ragged veterans of unemployability fanned out through the neighborhood to convert more living statues to lives of usefulness, to helping the injured, or at least getting them the hell indoors somewhere before they froze to death.\n\u201cGod is in the details,\u201d Anonymous tells us in the sixteenth edition of Bartlett\u2019s Familiar Quotations. The seemingly pipsqueak detail of what became of the armored limousine that delivered Zoltan Pepper to be creamed by the hook-and-ladder as he rang the doorbell of the Academy is a case in point. The limousine driver, Jerry Rivers, had moved it fifty yards to the west, toward the Hudson River, after unloading his paraplegic passenger and his wheelchair on the sidewalk.\nThat was still part of the rerun. Rerun or not, though, Jerry wasn\u2019t to stay parked in front of the Academy, lest the luxury vehicle arouse suspicions that the Academy might not be an abandoned building after all. If that hadn\u2019t been the policy, the limousine would have absorbed the impact of the fire truck, and possibly but not certainly saved the life of Zoltan Pepper as he rang the doorbell.\nBut at what cost? The entrance to the Academy would not have been broached, giving Kilgore Trout access to Dudley Prince and the other armed guards. Trout could not have put on a spare guard\u2019s uniform he found in there, which made him look like an authority figure. He would not have been able to arm himself with the Academy\u2019s bazooka, with which he knocked out the braying burglar alarms of impacted but unoccupied parked vehicles.\n52\nThe American Academy of Arts and Letters owned a bazooka because the warlords who knocked over Columbia University spearheaded their attack with a tank stolen from the Rainbow Division of the National Guard.

In it I told of my conquests of all the hundreds of women my wife, my Helga, had been. It was clinical, obsessed\u2014some say, insane. It was a diary, recording day by day for the first two years of the war, our erotic life\u2014to the exclusion of all else. There is not one word in it to indicate even the century or the continent of its origin.\nThere is a man of many moods, a woman of many moods. In some of the early entries, settings are referred to sketchily. But from there on, there are no settings at all.\nHelga knew I kept the peculiar diary. I kept it as one of many devices for keeping our sexual pleasure keen. The book is not only a report of an experiment, but a part of the experiment it reports\u2014a self-conscious experiment by a man and a woman to be endlessly fascinating to each other sexually\u2014\nTo be more than that.\nTo be to each other, body and soul, sufficient reasons for living, though there might not be a single other satisfaction to be had.\nThe epigraph of the book is to the point, I think.\nIt is a poem by William Blake called \u201cThe Question Answered\u201d:\nWhat is it men in women do require?\nThe lineaments of Gratified Desire.", 0.18690476190476188], "title": "Mother Night"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["syrup", 0.16441961740476146], ["factory", 0.07617452046912658], ["boxes", 0.060477379807761945], ["vitamins", 0.060477379807761945], ["spooning", 0.060477379807761945], ["gluck", 0.060477379807761945], ["spooned", 0.060477379807761945], ["pregnant", 0.054806539134920486], ["minerals", 0.05078301364608438], ["hidden", 0.047662124816515015], ["side", 0.03663474914708467], ["zinc", 0.03508587298471975], ["workers", 0.03508587298471975], ["jars", 0.03508587298471975], ["hickory", 0.03508587298471975], ["admitted", 0.03508587298471975], ["floors", 0.03508587298471975], ["widow", 0.03508587298471975], ["swept", 0.03508587298471975], ["simmering", 0.03508587298471975], ["secretly", 0.03508587298471975], ["lavatories", 0.03508587298471975], ["cardboard", 0.03508587298471975], ["sealed", 0.03508587298471975], ["enriched", 0.03508587298471975], ["tasted", 0.03508587298471975], ["cleaned", 0.03508587298471975], ["rafters", 0.03508587298471975], ["haste", 0.03508587298471975], ["army", 0.032296917981996], ["true", 0.032296917981996], ["day", 0.03066989738445127], ["radiators", 0.030238689903880973], ["laced", 0.030238689903880973], ["gloves", 0.030238689903880973], ["impatiently", 0.030238689903880973], ["werner", 0.030238689903880973], ["crime", 0.030238689903880973], ["honey", 0.030238689903880973], ["communal", 0.030238689903880973], ["loaves", 0.030238689903880973], ["drawers", 0.030238689903880973], ["counter", 0.030238689903880973], ["stacks", 0.030238689903880973], ["woman", 0.029746966138723914], ["lunch", 0.027403269567460243], ["fires", 0.027403269567460243], ["lots", 0.027403269567460243], ["washed", 0.027403269567460243], ["range", 0.027403269567460243], ["needed", 0.027403269567460243], ["malt", 0.027403269567460243], ["fools", 0.027403269567460243], ["asked", 0.026844969619543135], ["wasn", 0.026844969619543135], ["derby", 0.02572344064988781], ["hat", 0.02539150682304219], ["spoons", 0.02539150682304219], ["laid", 0.02539150682304219], ["work", 0.02515250366359054], ["job", 0.023831062408257508], ["smoke", 0.023831062408257508], ["soup", 0.023831062408257508], ["cans", 0.023831062408257508], ["persons", 0.023831062408257508], ["spoon", 0.023831062408257508], ["bread", 0.022556086486621465], ["thin", 0.022556086486621465], ["vermont", 0.022556086486621465], ["month", 0.021478109704612662], ["destroyed", 0.021478109704612662], ["unconscious", 0.021478109704612662], ["main", 0.020544323742203417], ["windows", 0.020544323742203417], ["low", 0.019720666150200735], ["warm", 0.019720666150200735], ["worked", 0.019720666150200735], ["women", 0.019720666150200735], ["real", 0.018983879327418733], ["naked", 0.018983879327418733], ["kitchen", 0.018983879327418733], ["slaughterhouse", 0.018983879327418733], ["waiting", 0.018317374573542336], ["gas", 0.018317374573542336], ["americans", 0.01823367510644219], ["coat", 0.017708903405782683], ["second", 0.01714916419128243], ["weren", 0.016630926623773884], ["young", 0.016148458990998], ["soldiers", 0.015273192257053902], ["black", 0.015273192257053902], ["top", 0.015273192257053902], ["city", 0.014495390612926458], ["white", 0.014136696246579953], ["coming", 0.014136696246579953], ["supposed", 0.013795506287353156], ["edgar", 0.013795506287353156], ["closed", 0.013159340006194228], ["heard", 0.012861720324943905], ["long", 0.011783743542935106], ["door", 0.011783743542935106], ["big", 0.01153834969810105], ["wanted", 0.011071976449858587], ["dead", 0.009648207532087682], ["thing", 0.009648207532087682], ["three", 0.009466560774022923], ["billy", 0.008605404815769515], ["dresden", 0.00831215692535545], ["pilgrim", 0.0049875156895856955], ["war", 0.004619377693184144]], "sentiment": ["Werner Gluck, who had never seen a naked woman before, closed the door. Billy had never seen one, either. It was nothing new to Derby.\nWhen the three fools found the communal kitchen, whose main job was to make lunch for workers in the slaughterhouse, everybody had gone home but one woman who had been waiting for them impatiently. She was a war widow. So it goes. She had her hat and coat on. She wanted to go home, too, even though there wasn\u2019t anybody there. Her white gloves were laid out side by side on the zinc counter top.\nShe had two big cans of soup for the Americans. It was simmering over low fires on the gas range. She had stacks of loaves of black bread, too.\nShe asked Gluck if he wasn\u2019t awfully young to be in the army. He admitted that he was.\nShe asked Edgar Derby if he wasn\u2019t awfully old to be in the army. He said he was.\nShe asked Billy Pilgrim what he was supposed to be, Billy said he didn\u2019t know. He was just trying to keep warm.\n\u201cAll the real soldiers are dead,\u201d she said. It was true. So it goes.\nAnother true thing that Billy saw while he was unconscious in Vermont was the work that he and the others had to do in Dresden during the month before the city was destroyed. They washed windows and swept floors and cleaned lavatories and put jars into boxes and sealed cardboard boxes in a factory that made malt syrup. The syrup was enriched with vitamins and minerals. The syrup was for pregnant women.\nThe syrup tasted like thin honey laced with hickory smoke, and everybody who worked in the factory secretly spooned it all day long. They weren\u2019t pregnant, but they needed vitamins and minerals, too. Billy didn\u2019t spoon syrup on his first day at work, but lots of other Americans did.\nBilly spooned it on his second day. There were spoons hidden all over the factory, on rafters, in drawers, behind radiators, and so on.

\u201cWhat a life!\u201d and so on. It was all very funny, except he didn\u2019t feel like laughing. He thought that life had now taken his measure, had found him not worth much of anything, and was now through with him. Little did he know!\nHe went out on the sun deck, which was aft of the bridge and the officers\u2019 cabins, his bare feet on bare steel. Now that the sun deck had been stripped of its carpeting, the plugged holes which were supposed to receive the mounts for weapons were plainly visible, even in starlight. I myself had welded four of the plates on the sun deck. Most of my work, and my finest work, however, was deep inside.\nThe Captain looked up at the stars, and his big brain told him that his planet was an insignificant speck of dust in the cosmos, and that he was a germ on that speck, and that nothing could matter less than what became of him. That was what those big brains used to do with their excess capacity: blather on like that. To what purpose? You won\u2019t catch anybody thinking thoughts like that today.\nSo then he saw a shooting star\u2014a meteorite burning up on the edge of the atmosphere, up where Lieutenant Colonel Reyes in his space suit had just received word that Peru was officially at war with Ecuador. The shooting star cued the Captain\u2019s big brain to have him marvel yet again about how unprepared people were for meteorites striking the Earth\u2019s surface.\nAnd then there was this tremendous explosion out at the airport, as the rocket and the radar dish honeymooned.\nThe hotel bus, all painted up outside with the blue-footed boobies and marine iguanas and penguins and flightless cormorants and so on, was at that moment parked in front of a hospital. The Captain\u2019s brother *Siegfried was about to go inside to get help for *James Wait, who had lost consciousness. *Wait\u2019s heart attack had necessitated this detour on the way to the airport, which had surely saved the lives of all on board.\nThe great bubble of the shock wave from that explosion was as dense as bricks. To those on the bus, it seemed that hospital itself had exploded. The windows and windshield of the bus were blown inward, but turned out to have been shatterproof. They had not turned to shrapnel. Mary and Hisako and Selena and *Kazakh and poor *Wait and the Kanka-bono girls and the Captain\u2019s brother were pelted with seeming kernels of white corn instead.\nThis would happen on the Bah\u00eda de Darwin as well. The windows would all be blown in, and white kernels would be underfoot everywhere.\nThe hospital, so full of light only moments before, was blacked out now, as was the whole city, and there were cries for help coming from inside. The engine of the bus was still running, thank God, and its headlights illuminated a narrow pathway through the debris up ahead.

But another Armenian was groping her and nuzzling her hair and so on, and had an erection with which you might have smashed coconuts. I like to think we were man and wife. Life itself can be sacramental. The supposition was that we would be leaving the Garden of Eden together, and would cleave to one another in the wilderness through thick and thin.\nI don\u2019t know why we laughed so much.\nOur ages again: I was almost twenty, and she was twenty-nine. The man we were about to cuckold or whatever was fifty-three, with only seven more years to go, a mere stripling in retrospect. Imagine having all of seven more years to go!\nMaybe Marilee and I laughed so much because we were about to do the one thing other than eat and drink and sleep which our bodies said we were on Earth to do. There was no vengeance or defiance or defilement in it. We did not do it in the bed she and Gregory shared, or in Fred Jones\u2019s bed next door, or in the immaculate French Empire guest-room, or in the studio\u2014and not even on my own bed, although we could have done it almost anywhere except in the basement, since Fu Manchu was the only other person in the house just then. Our brainless lovemaking anticipated Abstract Expressionism in a way, since it was about absolutely nothing but itself.\nYes, and I am reminded now of what the painter Jim Brooks said to me about how he operated, about how all the Abstract Expressionists operated: \u201cI lay on the first stroke of color. After that, the canvas has to do at least half the work.\u201d The canvas, if things were going well, would, after that first stroke, begin suggesting or even demanding that he do this or that. In Marilee\u2019s and my case, the first stroke was a kiss just inside the front door, a big, wet, hot, hilariously smeary thing.\nTalk about paint!\nMarilee\u2019s and my canvas, so to speak, called for more and wetter kisses, and then a groping, goosey, swooning tango up the spiral staircase and through the grand dining room. We knocked over a chair, which we set up-right again. The canvas, doing all the work and not just half of it, sent us through the butler\u2019s pantry and into an unused storage room about eight feet square. The only thing in there was a broken-down sofa which must have been left by the previous owners. There was one tiny window, looking northward, into the leafless treetops of the back garden.\nWe needed no further instructions from the canvas as to what to do, should we wish to complete a masterpiece. This we did.\nNor did I need instructions from the experienced older woman as to what to do.\nBull\u2019s-eye and bull\u2019s-eye and bull\u2019s-eye again!", 0.10919312169312168], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["department", 0.10840912776668178], ["goldstein", 0.08354637418709611], ["offense", 0.07806671566420503], ["adventures", 0.07381636230583914], ["ginsberg", 0.07381636230583914], ["minds", 0.06740736732257795], ["children", 0.05492364440594686], ["nourished", 0.05223616127133957], ["rearing", 0.05223616127133957], ["disturbing", 0.05223616127133957], ["silence", 0.05223616127133957], ["calmer", 0.05223616127133957], ["embraced", 0.05223616127133957], ["dumbest", 0.05223616127133957], ["antiestablishment", 0.05223616127133957], ["harrowing", 0.05223616127133957], ["inducted", 0.05223616127133957], ["newsweek", 0.04563475955172105], ["deadbeats", 0.04563475955172105], ["comforted", 0.04563475955172105], ["chocolate", 0.04563475955172105], ["unafraid", 0.04563475955172105], ["occur", 0.04563475955172105], ["biochemistry", 0.04563475955172105], ["1973", 0.04563475955172105], ["organization", 0.04563475955172105], ["english", 0.045595323431092176], ["utter", 0.041773187093548055], ["marks", 0.041773187093548055], ["tender", 0.041773187093548055], ["undergraduate", 0.041773187093548055], ["bankruptcy", 0.041773187093548055], ["meaningful", 0.041773187093548055], ["howl", 0.041773187093548055], ["charge", 0.039033357832102517], ["ice", 0.039033357832102517], ["playmates", 0.039033357832102517], ["patient", 0.039033357832102517], ["poems", 0.039033357832102517], ["comment", 0.039033357832102517], ["afford", 0.039033357832102517], ["cream", 0.039033357832102517], ["intended", 0.039033357832102517], ["goodness", 0.03690818115291957], ["experienced", 0.03690818115291957], ["intend", 0.03690818115291957], ["national", 0.03517178537392953], ["conservative", 0.03517178537392953], ["allen", 0.03517178537392953], ["doors", 0.03517178537392953], ["establishment", 0.03517178537392953], ["physics", 0.03517178537392953], ["suddenly", 0.03370368366128897], ["amusing", 0.03370368366128897], ["luck", 0.03243195611248399], ["institute", 0.03243195611248399], ["childhood", 0.03243195611248399], ["printed", 0.03243195611248399], ["eat", 0.03131021291575653], ["house", 0.03113617774820184], ["easily", 0.030306779433301043], ["die", 0.030306779433301043], ["education", 0.030306779433301043], ["gold", 0.029399063435164616], ["subject", 0.029399063435164616], ["account", 0.029399063435164616], ["return", 0.028570383654311002], ["deal", 0.028570383654311002], ["generation", 0.028570383654311002], ["meant", 0.027102281941670445], ["letters", 0.026445206975128047], ["arts", 0.025830554392865464], ["members", 0.024708811196138006], ["door", 0.022797661715546088], ["parents", 0.02120667043303974], ["age", 0.02120667043303974], ["music", 0.020847238737965013], ["year", 0.018375703542868965], ["best", 0.018107409476519478], ["university", 0.0178464668652041], ["writers", 0.0178464668652041], ["books", 0.017592483559659707], ["three", 0.01734509797486675], ["called", 0.01686880825510807], ["human", 0.016196259995927564], ["father", 0.015772909876205336], ["read", 0.013730911101486715], ["great", 0.013565275456611769], ["american", 0.013084981612546133], ["vonnegut", 0.011774301823250437], ["good", 0.009068547050832373], ["people", 0.008003866993802688]], "sentiment": ["No offense intended, but it would never occur to me to look for the best minds in any generation in an undergraduate English department anywhere.

He looked about the weirdly illuminated room for something to talk to the boy about, saw the corner of a photograph sticking out from under the pillow on the bed. Fred pulled it into the open, thinking it was probably a picture of some sports hero, or maybe a picture of Fred himself at the helm of the Rosebud II.\nBut it turned out to be a pornographic picture that little Franklin had bought that morning from Lila Buntline, using money he earned himself on his paper route. It showed two fat, simpering, naked whores, one of whom was attempting to have impossible sexual congress with a dignified, decent, un-smiling Shetland pony.\nSickened, confused, Fred put the picture into his pocket, stumbled out into the kitchen, wondered what, in God's name, to say.\nAbout the kitchen: an electric chair would not have seemed out of place in it. It was Caroline's idea of a place of torment. There was a philodendron. It had died of thirst. In the soapdish on the sink was a mottled ball of soap made out of many moistened slivers pressed together. Making soap balls out of slivers was the only household art Caroline had brought to marriage. It was a thing her mother had taught her to do.\nFred thought of filling the bathtub with hot water, of climbing in and slashing his wrists with a stainless steel razorblade. But then he saw that the little plastic garbage can in the corner was full, knew how hysterical Caroline became if she got up from a drunken sleep and found that no one had carried out the garbage. So he carried it to the garage and dumped it, then washed out the can with the hose at the side of the house.\n\"Frusha-frusha-blacka-blacka-burl,\" said the water in the can. And Fred saw that someone had left the light on in the cellar. He looked down through the dusty window in an areaway, saw the top of the jelly cupboard. Resting on it was the family history his father had written\u2014a history that Fred had never wished to read. There was also a can of rat poison there, and a thirty-eight-calibre revolver sick with rust.\nIt was an interesting still life. And then Fred perceived that it wasn't entirely at rest. A little mouse was nibbling at one corner of the manuscript.\nFred tapped on the window. The mouse hesitated, looked everywhere but at Fred, went on nibbling again.\nFred went down into the basement, took the manuscript from its shelf to see how badly damaged it was. He blew the dust from the title page, which said, A History of the Rosewaters of Rhode Island, by Merrihue Rosewater. Fred untied the string that held the manuscript together, turned to page one, which said:\nThe Old World home of the Rosewaters was and is in the Scilly Islands, off Cornwall. The founder of the family there, whose name was John, arrived on St. Mary Island in 1645, with the party accompanying the fifteen-year-old Prince Charles, later to become Charles the Second, who was fleeing the Puritan Revolution. The name Rosewater was then a pseudonym. Until John chose it for himself, there were no Rosewaters in England. His real name was John Graham. He was the youngest of the five sons of James Graham, Fifth Earl and First Marquis of Montrose. There was need for a pseudonym, for James Graham was a leader of the Royalist cause, and the Royalist cause was lost. James, among other romantic exploits, once disguised himself, went to the Scotch Highlands, organized a small, fierce army, and led it to six bloody victories over the far greater forces of the Lowland Presbyterian Army of Archibald Campbell, the Eighth Earl of Argyll. James was also a poet. So every Rosewater is in fact a Graham, and has the blood of Scotch nobility in him. James was hanged in 1650.", -0.0516999141999142], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["cried", 0.13175261356641257], ["impresarios", 0.09968308922147148], ["bluh", 0.09968308922147148], ["arc", 0.09968308922147148], ["fluh", 0.09968308922147148], ["joan", 0.09968308922147148], ["banked", 0.09968308922147148], ["grasped", 0.08660484053166119], ["responsive", 0.08660484053166119], ["stake", 0.08660484053166119], ["testify", 0.08660484053166119], ["immobilized", 0.08660484053166119], ["lower", 0.08660484053166119], ["rush", 0.08660484053166119], ["melodrama", 0.08660484053166119], ["speaks", 0.08660484053166119], ["catching", 0.08660484053166119], ["loudly", 0.07895455547301657], ["crowds", 0.07895455547301657], ["provided", 0.07895455547301657], ["wrist", 0.07895455547301657], ["female", 0.07352659184185091], ["legs", 0.07352659184185091], ["gathered", 0.07352659184185091], ["theater", 0.06931633615667714], ["experience", 0.06931633615667714], ["lying", 0.06931633615667714], ["modern", 0.06587630678320629], ["bags", 0.06587630678320629], ["personal", 0.06296780339023915], ["understand", 0.06296780339023915], ["clearly", 0.06044834315204062], ["worth", 0.06044834315204062], ["piece", 0.05822602172456168], ["eye", 0.05822602172456168], ["saint", 0.05822602172456168], ["sound", 0.05822602172456168], ["walter", 0.054077589699167164], ["kathleen", 0.05099539984957218], ["mary", 0.05026264189270042], ["voice", 0.04988955470042887], ["loved", 0.047370094462230325], ["shopping", 0.046226233673240996], ["care", 0.04412763678436883], ["sort", 0.03614920563682103], ["great", 0.0326010503254448], ["heard", 0.03104938809455854], ["will", 0.027038794849583582], ["time", 0.012982714690630164]], "sentiment": ["\u201cMust rush,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said.\n\u201cTake care,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said.\nHe was gone.\nMary Kathleen\u2019s shopping bags were still banked around my legs.

Some of the words came through. \u201cI thought of all the people who come out here to visit their relatives in prison, and I realized how most of them were black, and I thought how much black people liked fried chicken,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo you want me to open a Nigger joint?\u201d said Dwayne. And so on. So Francine now had the distinction of being the second close associate of Dwayne\u2019s who discovered how vile he could be.\n\u201cHarry LeSabre was right\u201d said Francine.

He had bought one hundred shares of Xerox, for instance, for eight dollars a share. With the passage of time, his shares had become one hundred times as valuable, simply lying in the total darkness and silence of a safe-deposit box.\nThere was a lot of money magic like that going on.

She was smoking a small cigar in a long holder made from the legbone of a stork. A stork was a large European bird, about half the size of a Bermuda Ern. Children who wanted to know where babies came from were sometimes told that they were brought by storks. People who told their children such a thing felt that their children were too young to think intelligently about wide-open beavers and all that.\nAnd there were actually pictures of storks delivering babies on birth announcements and in cartoons and so on, for children to see.

The big captain seemed self-conscious, and I sensed that the red-headed major was a little belligerent.\nThe captain ran his finger down the margin of a page, and shook his head dispiritedly. \u201c\u2018Machine gun, mortar, motorcycle\u2026tank, tourniquet, trench.\u2019 Nothing about filing cabinets, desks, or chairs.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell you expect?\u201d said the major. \u201cIt\u2019s a book for soldiers, not a bunch of pansy clerks.\u201d He scowled at the pamphlet, said something completely unintelligible, and looked up at me expectantly. \u201cThere\u2019s one hell of a swell book,\u201d he said. \u201cSays that\u2019s the way to ask for an interpreter, and the old man acts like it was Ubangi poetry.\u201d\n\u201cGentlemen, I speak English,\u201d I said, \u201cand my daughter, Marta, too.\u201d\n\u201cBy God, he really does,\u201d said the major. \u201cGood for you, Pop.\u201d He made me feel like a small dog, who had cleverly\u2014for a small dog\u2014fetched him a rubber ball.\nI held out my hand to the major, and told him my name. He looked down at my hand superciliously, and kept his hands in his pockets. I felt myself reddening.\n\u201cMy name is Captain Paul Donnini,\u201d said the other man quickly, \u201cand this is Major Lawson Evans.\u201d He shook my hand. \u201cSir,\u201d he said to me\u2014his voice was paternal and deep\u2014\u201cthe Russians\u2014\u201d\nThe major used an epithet that made my jaw drop, and amazed Marta, who has heard soldiers talk for the better part of her life.", -0.024088541666666678], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
