Well, it\u2019s all done now, and due out on October 4, coincidentally Nanny\u2019s birthday. I also wrote a play this summer, finished it only a week ago. The next problem is to get some theater people to read it and tell me why it will not work. I would rather be a playwright than anything, mainly because playwrights are allowed to smoke backstage.\nOn the day I finished the play, Edith called to say that she would be marrying on Cape Cod on September 14th. The groom-to-be is a darling man she has been living with for about the past three years\u2014a John Squibb. They grew up together on Cape Cod, and he is a Jack-of-all-trades, a housebuilder, a cabinetmaker and so on. Edith by golly actually makes a pretty good living as an artist. Who said the Age of Miracles was past?\nI see John Irving a lot, since his summer home is only a few hundred meters from mine out on Long Island. He had me to supper the other night with Gail Godwin.
