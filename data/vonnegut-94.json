CORDELL\nWalter Vonnegut, Sr., was an actor who was married to the actress Marjorie Potts. She played opposite George M. Cohan in the original Broadway production of Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s Ah, Wilderness! As a child, Walter, Jr., was also in the cast (he is Kurt\u2019s cousin and the lifelong friend who is known in the family as \u201cthe Colonel\u201d). Marjorie divorced Walter, Sr., who was an alcoholic, and married Don Marquis, an author and playwright who gained fame as the creator of Archy and Mehitabel. Archy was a talking cockroach who hopped from key to key on Marquis\u2019s typewriter at night, writing poems and stories about Mehitabel the cat. The characters were reproduced in popular columns that Marquis wrote for leading newspapers of the 1920s and \u201930s, including the New-York Tribune (renamed the New York Herald Tribune in 1924) and the New York Sun. Three books of poems by Archy were published.\nDear Mr. Cordell:\nYour pleasant letter of November 4 only got here today.

Foster?\"\n\"Ain\u2019t never heard of no damn\u2019 Herbert Foster.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nI sat in a booth to think it over. Herbert had apparently picked the joint out of a telephone book, and told Alma it was where he spent his weekend evenings. In a way, it made me feel better, because it began to look as though Herbert maybe had better reasons than he\u2019d given me for letting eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars get musty. I remembered that every time I\u2019d mentioned his giving up the weekend job, he\u2019d reacted like a man hearing a dentist tune up his drill. I saw it now: the minute he let Alma know he was rich, he\u2019d lose his excuse for getting away from her on weekends.\nBut what was it that was worth more to Herbert than eight hundred and fifty thousand? Binges? Dope? Women? I sighed, and admitted I was kidding myself, that I was no closer to the answer than I\u2019d ever been. Moral turpitude on Herbert\u2019s part was inconceivable. Whatever he was up to, it had to be for a good cause. His mother had done such a thorough job on him, and he was so awfully ashamed of his father\u2019s failings, that I was sure he couldn\u2019t operate any other way but righteously. I gave up on the puzzle, and ordered a nightcap.\nAnd then Herbert Foster, looking drab and hunted, picked his way through the crowd. His expression was one of disapproval, of a holy man in Babylon. He was oddly stiff-necked and held his arms at his sides as he pointedly kept from brushing against anyone or from meeting any of the gazes that fell upon him. There was no question that being in the place was absolute, humiliating hell for him.\nI called to him, but he paid no attention. There was no communicating with him. Herbert was in a near coma of see-no-evil, speak-no-evil, hear-no-evil.\nThe crowd in the rear parted for him, and I expected to see Herbert go into a dark corner for a broom or a mop. But a light flashed on at the far end of the aisle the crowd made for him, and a tiny white piano sparkled there like jewelry. The bartender set a drink on the piano, and went back to his post.\nHerbert dusted off the piano bench with his handkerchief, and sat down gingerly. He took a cigarette from his breast pocket and lighted it. And then the cigarette started to droop slowly from his lips; and, as it drooped, Herbert hunched over the keyboard and his eyes narrowed as though he were focusing on something beautiful on a faraway horizon.\nStartlingly, Herbert Foster disappeared. In his place sat an excited stranger, his hands poised like claws. Suddenly he struck, and a spasm of dirty, low-down, gorgeous jazz shook the air, a hot, clanging wraith of the twenties.", 0.09293650793650794], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["windshield", 0.10092193783804766], ["donna", 0.09464919265869068], ["schramms", 0.07266011253880453], ["microsecond", 0.07266011253880453], ["dozens", 0.06309946177246045], ["indiana", 0.057506839591658185], ["waltz", 0.05242930562970632], ["marry", 0.05046096891902383], ["shotgun", 0.04581997255183468], ["car", 0.045037566324931284], ["pregnant", 0.03958569498296493], ["dina", 0.036330056269402264], ["electricity", 0.036330056269402264], ["identical", 0.036330056269402264], ["postwar", 0.036330056269402264], ["brakes", 0.036330056269402264], ["weddings", 0.036330056269402264], ["joyriding", 0.036330056269402264], ["twins", 0.036330056269402264], ["impregnated", 0.036330056269402264], ["uppers", 0.036330056269402264], ["lowers", 0.036330056269402264], ["pregnancy", 0.036330056269402264], ["apprehended", 0.036330056269402264], ["hudson", 0.036330056269402264], ["convicted", 0.036330056269402264], ["sentenced", 0.036330056269402264], ["false", 0.036330056269402264], ["horton", 0.036330056269402264], ["set", 0.03530769597187749], ["married", 0.033581307793201544], ["felix", 0.032967136294822716], ["felt", 0.03279291587816777], ["town", 0.03266852492998742], ["kokomo", 0.031549730886230226], ["refers", 0.031549730886230226], ["twin", 0.031549730886230226], ["discharged", 0.031549730886230226], ["divorced", 0.031549730886230226], ["border", 0.031549730886230226], ["wheel", 0.031549730886230226], ["weren", 0.03133966738633569], ["wedding", 0.028753419795829092], ["waltzes", 0.028753419795829092], ["prewar", 0.028753419795829092], ["driving", 0.028753419795829092], ["cars", 0.028753419795829092], ["sort", 0.027720849945404774], ["teeth", 0.02676940550305819], ["wisp", 0.02676940550305819], ["marriage", 0.02676940550305819], ["eighteen", 0.02676940550305819], ["blood", 0.02676940550305819], ["undifferentiated", 0.025230484459511916], ["accidentally", 0.025230484459511916], ["hearing", 0.025230484459511916], ["locked", 0.025230484459511916], ["nothingness", 0.025230484459511916], ["shit", 0.025230484459511916], ["owned", 0.023973094412657055], ["duty", 0.02290998627591734], ["putting", 0.02290998627591734], ["sister", 0.02290998627591734], ["wife", 0.022486510335681963], ["army", 0.02198908011988615], ["loved", 0.02198908011988615], ["die", 0.02117678332225592], ["served", 0.02117678332225592], ["man", 0.02110604883834427], ["wasn", 0.020464393450276785], ["incidentally", 0.02045015907633988], ["shepherdstown", 0.02045015907633988], ["sorts", 0.02045015907633988], ["cincinnati", 0.019792847491482465], ["prison", 0.019792847491482465], ["moved", 0.019792847491482465], ["schramm", 0.01919276902948502], ["full", 0.018640750355874425], ["hospital", 0.018640750355874425], ["mind", 0.018640750355874425], ["real", 0.018640750355874425], ["relatives", 0.018640750355874425], ["talk", 0.018640750355874425], ["peephole", 0.017653847985938744], ["drugstore", 0.017208754736714117], ["named", 0.016396457939083883], ["called", 0.015669833693167844], ["closed", 0.015333349802344173], ["friends", 0.015333349802344173], ["half", 0.013860424972702387], ["woman", 0.013600146848682753], ["father", 0.013504916735629006], ["couldn", 0.01334933550957327], ["hadn", 0.01310732640742658], ["family", 0.01310732640742658], ["things", 0.01310732640742658], ["knew", 0.01310732640742658], ["god", 0.012873522602766708], ["work", 0.012873522602766708], ["thing", 0.012647385893642634], ["left", 0.011810414466026996], ["night", 0.010889508309995806], ["day", 0.009925632845339538], ["war", 0.009925632845339538], ["brother", 0.009632118263140945], ["midland", 0.007129321754938405], ["people", 0.006646848730063162], ["years", 0.0062837884991292165], ["city", 0.0057726990360001], ["mother", 0.005070749420069463]], "sentiment": ["He was apprehended at the Indiana border, and tried and convicted, and sentenced to die over at Shepherdstown.

In the next microsecond he was a wisp of undifferentiated nothingness again.\nServed him right.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe drugstore was owned by a man named Horton in Cincinnati, incidentally. There weren\u2019t any Schramms left in town. There used to be dozens of Schramms in town.\nThere used to be dozens of Waltzes in town, too. But when I went to work at Schramm\u2019s, there were only four of us\u2014Mother, Father, and me, and my brother\u2019s first wife Donna. She was half of a set of what used to be identical twins. She and Felix were divorced, but she still called herself Donna Waltz. So she wasn\u2019t a real Waltz, a blood Waltz.\nAnd she would never have been a Waltz of any sort, if Felix hadn\u2019t accidentally put her through a windshield the day after he was discharged from the Army. He hardly knew her, since her family had moved to Midland City from Kokomo, Indiana, while he was at war. He couldn\u2019t even tell her from her twin, Dina.\nThey were out joyriding in her father\u2019s car. Thank God it wasn\u2019t our car, anyway. We didn\u2019t have a car anymore. We didn\u2019t have shit anymore, and Father was still in prison. But Felix was driving. He was at the wheel. And the brakes locked. It was a prewar Hudson. There weren\u2019t any postwar cars yet.\nSo Donna went through the windshield, and she didn\u2019t look anything like her sister anymore. And Felix married her after she got out of the hospital. She was only eighteen years old, but she had a full set of false teeth, uppers and lowers.\nFelix now refers to his first marriage as a \u201cshotgun wedding.\u201d Her relatives and friends felt it was his duty to marry her, whether he loved her or not\u2014and Felix says that he felt that way, too. Usually, when people talk about shotgun weddings, they have pregnancy in mind. A man has impregnated a woman, so he has to marry her.\nFelix didn\u2019t get his first wife pregnant before he married her, but he put her through a windshield. \u201cI might as well have got her pregnant,\u201d he said the other night. \u201cPutting her through a windshield came to very much the same sort of thing.\u201d", 0.08107142857142856], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["truth", 0.2092814685215108], ["moments", 0.16242880518409183], ["motorcycle", 0.1618073817201666], ["smoking", 0.13893229058883946], ["cigarettes", 0.13893229058883946], ["friend", 0.12171632949825455], ["heinz", 0.11543577599358709], ["speak", 0.10787158781344439], ["streaming", 0.09296265988967212], ["speaks", 0.09296265988967212], ["cheeks", 0.09296265988967212], ["ration", 0.09296265988967212], ["rare", 0.09296265988967212], ["habits", 0.09296265988967212], ["quit", 0.08121440259204592], ["jewelry", 0.08121440259204592], ["refuse", 0.08121440259204592], ["meat", 0.08121440259204592], ["favorite", 0.08121440259204592], ["believing", 0.07434211262411095], ["offered", 0.07434211262411095], ["forget", 0.06946614529441973], ["market", 0.06946614529441973], ["sake", 0.06946614529441973], ["sold", 0.06946614529441973], ["ashamed", 0.06946614529441973], ["bomb", 0.06568405120434838], ["tears", 0.06568405120434838], ["furniture", 0.06259385532648475], ["hit", 0.059981131939582065], ["speaking", 0.057717887996793546], ["loved", 0.057717887996793546], ["honor", 0.057717887996793546], ["apartment", 0.05572156535854976], ["drunk", 0.05572156535854976], ["bad", 0.04823287464195587], ["killed", 0.045969630699167346], ["true", 0.044942094736176934], ["story", 0.04397330806092356], ["time", 0.04239628572519986], ["black", 0.03909734073123236], ["left", 0.03648461734432968], ["things", 0.02734908343360617], ["told", 0.026321547470615752], ["people", 0.025352760795362382], ["man", 0.01688407735183924]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI want to be a friend of yours, and I want to believe everything you say, Heinz,\u201d I said to him, \u201cbut I refuse to believe that.

He was in command of one-tenth of the force that was to attack the United States of America when the attack on Earth was mounted. Down the line were units training to attack Russia, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, Mexico, China, Nepal, Uruguay....\nTo the best of Boaz\u2019s knowledge, there were eight hundred real commanders of the Army of Mars\u2014not one of them with an apparent rank above buck sergeant. The nominal commander of the entire Army, General of the Armies Borders M. Pulsifer, was in fact controlled at all times by his orderly, Corporal Bert Wright. Corporal Wright, the perfect orderly, carried aspirin for the general\u2019s almost chronic headaches.\nThe advantages of a system of secret commanders are obvious. Any rebellion within the Army of Mars would be directed against the wrong people. And, in time of war, the enemy could exterminate the entire Martian officer class without disturbing the Army of Mars in the least.\n\"Seven hundred and ninety-nine,\" said Boaz out loud, correcting his own understanding of the number of real commanders. One of the real commanders was dead, having been strangled at the stake by Unk. The strangled man had been Private Stony Stevenson, former real commander of a British attack unit. Stony had become so fascinated by Unk\u2019s struggles to understand what was going on that he had begun, unconsciously, to help Unk think.\nStevenson had suffered the ultimate humiliation for this. An antenna had been installed in his skull, and he had been forced by it to march to the stake like a good soldier\u2014there to await murder by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nBoaz let his squadmates go on standing at attention \u2014 let them go on quivering, thinking nothing, seeing nothing. Boaz went to Unk\u2019s cot, lay down on it with his big, lustrous shoes on the brown blanket. He folded his hands behind his head\u2014arched his body like a bow.\n\"Awwwww\u2014\" said Boaz, somewhere between a yawn and a groan. \"Awwwww\u2014now, men, men, men,\" he said, letting his mind idle. \"God damn, now, men,\" he said. It was lazy, nonsense talk. Boaz was a little bored with his toys. It occurred to him to have them fight each other\u2014but the penalty for doing that, if he got caught, was the same penalty Stony Stevenson had paid.\n\"Awwwww\u2014now, men. Really now, men,\" said Boaz languidly.\n\"God damn it now, men,\" he said. \"I got it made. You men got to admit that. Old Boaz is doing how you might say real fine.\"\nHe rolled off the bed, landed on all fours, sprang to his feet with pantherlike grace. He smiled dazzlingly. He was doing everything he could to enjoy the fortunate position in life that was his. \"You boys ain\u2019t got it so bad,\" he said to his rigid squadmates. \"You oughta see how we treat the generals, if you think you\u2019s bad off.\" He chuckled and cooed. \"Two nights ago us real commanders got ourselves in a argument about which general could run the fastest. Next thing you know, we got all twenty-three generals out of bed, all bare-ass naked, and we lined \u2019em up like they was race horses, and then we put our money down and laid the odds, and then we sent them generals off like the devil was after \u2019em. General Stover, he done placed first, with General Harrison right behind him, and with General Mosher behind him. Next morning, ever\u2019 general in the Army was stiff as a board.

two weeks after I got there. That finally became what was going to happen next: she would drop dead in Turtle Bay Chemists, a drugstore two blocks away.\nBut here was the thing: the undertaker discovered that she wasn\u2019t just a woman, and she wasn\u2019t just a man, either. She was somewhat both. She was a hermaphrodite.\nAn even more trivial footnote: she would be promptly replaced as Dan Gregory\u2019s cook by Sam Wu, the laundry man.\nMarilee arrived home from the hospital in a wheelchair two days after my arrival. Dan Gregory did not come down to greet her. I don\u2019t think he would have stopped working if the house were on fire. He was like my father making cowboy boots or Terry Kitchen with his spray gun or Jackson Pollock dribbling paint on a canvas on the floor: when he was doing art, the whole rest of the world dropped away.\nAnd I would be like that, too, after the war, and it would wreck my first marriage and my determination to be a good father. I had a very hard time getting the hang of civilian life after the war, and then I discovered something as powerful and irresponsible as shooting up with heroin: if I started laying on just one color of paint to a huge canvas, I could make the whole world drop away.\nAnd Gregory\u2019s total concentration on his work for twelve or more hours a day meant that I, as his apprentice, had a very easy job indeed. He had nothing for me to do, and did not want to waste time inventing tasks. He had told me to make a painting of his studio, but once he himself got back to work, I think he forgot all about it.\nDid I make a painting of his studio which was virtually indistinguishable from a photograph? Yes, I did, yes I did.\nBut I was the only person who gave a damn if I even tried to work such a miracle, or not. I was so unworthy of his attention, so far from being a genius, a Gregorian to his Beskudnikov, a threat or a son or whatever, that I might as well have been his cook, who had to be told what to prepare for dinner.\nAnything!

It seemed to me that they should be the happiest people on earth, but looks of sleepy ruefulness crossed their faces like clouds from time to time. I have seen those same clouds at subsequent encounters\u2014and only now do I have a theory to explain them:\nI surmise that Bob and Ray feel accursed sometimes\u2014 like crewmen on the Flying Dutchman or caged squirrels on an exercise wheel. They are so twangingly attuned to their era and to each other that they can go on being extremely funny almost indefinitely.\nSuch an unlimited opportunity to make people happy must become profoundly pooping by and by.\nIt occurs to me, too, as I look through this marvelous book, that Bob and Ray\u2019s jokes are singularly burglar-proof. They aren\u2019t like most other comedians\u2019 jokes these days, aren\u2019t rooted in show business and the world of celebrities and news of the day. They feature Americans who are almost always fourth-rate or below, engaged in enterprises which, if not contemptible, are at least insane.\nAnd while other comedians show us persons tormented by bad luck and enemies and so on, Bob and Ray\u2019s characters threaten to wreck themselves and their surroundings with their own stupidity.

His two big sons, Manny and Kenny, lay head-to-head in the bow, murmuring in lazy lechery. Each boy had a six-foot tuna gaff beside him. Harry was armed with a twelve-pound mall. All three wore rubber aprons and boots. When they got to work, they would bathe in gore.\n\"Stop talking about fucking,\" said Harry. \"Think about fish.\"\n\"We will, old man, when we're as old as you.\" This was a deeply affectionate reply.\nAn airplane came over very low, making its approach to Providence Airport. On board, reading The Conscience of a Conservative, was Norman Mushari.\nThe world's largest private collection of harpoons was displayed in a restaurant called The Weir, which was five miles outside of Pisquontuit. The marvellous collection belonged to a tall homosexual from New Bedford named Bunny Weeks. Until Bunny came down from New Bedford and opened his restaurant, Pisquontuit had nothing to do with whaling\u2014ever.\nBunny called his place The Weir because its Thermopane windows on the south looked out at the fish traps of Harry Pena. There were opera glasses on each table, in order that guests might watch Harry and his boys clean out their traps. And when the fisherfolk were performing out there on the briny deep, Bunny went from table to table, explaining with gusto and expertise what they were doing, and why. While disserting, he would paw women shamelessly, would never touch a man.\nIf guests wished to participate even more vibrantly in the fishing business, they might order a Horse Mackerel Cocktail, which was rum, grenadine, and cranberry juice, or a Fisherman's Salad, which was a peeled banana thrust through a pineapple ring, set in a nest of chilled, creamed tuna and curly coconut shreds.\nHarry Pena and his boys knew about the salad and the cocktail and the opera glasses, though they had never visited The Weir. Sometimes they would respond to their involuntary involvement with the restaurant by urinating off the boat. They called this \"... making cream of leek soup for Bunny Weeks.\"\nBunny Weeks' harpoon collection lay across the rude rafters of the gift shop that constituted the opulently mouldy entrance to The Weir. The shop itself was called The Jolly Whaler. There was a dusty skylight over the shop, the dusty effect having been achieved by spraying on Jet-Spray Bon Ami, and never wiping it off. The lattice of rafters and harpoons underneath the skylight was projected onto the merchandise below. The effect that Bunny had created was that real whalers, smelling of blubber and rum and sweat and ambergris, had stored their equipment in his loft. They would be coming back for it at any time.\nIt was through the criss-crossed shadows of harpoons that Amanita Buntline and Caroline Rosewater now shuffled. Amanita led the way, set the tone, examined the stock greedily, barbarously. As for the nature of the stock: it was everything a cold bitch might demand of an impotent husband upon rising from a scalding bath.", -0.043456302151954326], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"},

I didn\u2019t want to go right back downstairs again. There was no telephone in my room. I would say something in the morning.\nI was exhausted, I found. It was not yet curtain time in all the theaters down below, but I could hardly keep my eyes open. So I pulled my window-shade down, and I put myself to bed. Off I went, as my son used to say when he was little, \u201cto seepy-bye,\u201d which is to say, \u201cto sleep.\u201d\nI dreamed that I was in an easy chair at the Harvard Club of New York, only four blocks away. I was not young again. I was not a jailbird, however, but a very successful man\u2014the head of a medium-size foundation, perhaps, or assistant secretary of the interior, or executive director of the National Endowment for the Humanities, or some such thing. I really would have been some such thing in my sunset years, I honestly believe, if I had not testified against Leland Clewes in Nineteen-hundred and Forty-nine.\nIt was a compensatory dream. How I loved it. My clothes were in perfect repair. My wife was still alive. I was sipping brandy and coffee after a fine supper with several other members of the Class of Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-five. One detail from real life carried over into the dream: I was proud that I did not smoke anymore.\nBut then I absentmindedly accepted a cigarette. It was simply one more civilized satisfaction to go with the good talk and my warm belly and all. \u201cYes, yes\u2014\u201d I said, recalling some youthful shenanigans. I chuckled, eyes twinkling. I put the cigarette to my lips. A friend held a match to it. I inhaled the smoke right down to the soles of my feet.\nIn the dream I collapsed to the floor in convulsions. In real life I fell out of my bed at the Hotel Arapahoe. In the dream my damp, innocent pink lungs shriveled into two black raisins. Bitter brown tar seeped from my ears and nostrils.\nBut worst of all was the shame.\nEven as I was beginning to perceive that I was not in the Harvard Club, and that old classmates were not sitting forward in their leather chairs and looking down at me, and even after I found I could still gulp down air and it would nourish me\u2014even then I was still strangling on shame.\nI had just squandered the very last thing I had to be proud of in life: the fact that I did not smoke anymore.\nAnd as I came awake, I examined my hands in the light that billowed up from Times Square and then bounced down on me from my freshly painted ceiling.

He resigned from the Board soon after I was fired, and so would miss being taken hostage by the convicts. It would have been interesting to hear what he had to say to and about that particular kind of captor. One thing he used to say to me, and to a class of mine he spoke to one time, was that man was the weather now. Man was the tornadoes, man was the hailstones, man was the floods. So he might have said that Scipio was Pompeii, and the escapees were a lava flow.\nHe didn\u2019t resign from the Board on account of my firing. He had at least two personal tragedies, one right on top of the other. A company he inherited made all sorts of products out of asbestos, whose dust proved to be as carcinogenic as any substance yet identified, with the exception of epoxy cement and some of the radioactive stuff accidentally turned loose in the air and aquifers around nuclear weapons factories and power plants. He felt terrible about this, he told me, although he had never laid eyes on any of the factories that made the stuff. He sold them for practically nothing, since the company in Singapore that bought them got all the lawsuits along with the machinery and buildings, and an inventory of finished materials which was huge and unsalable in this country. The people in Singapore did what Ed couldn\u2019t bring himself to do, which was to sell all those floor tiles and roofing and so on to emerging nations in Africa.\nAnd then his son Bruce, Tarkington Class of \u201985, who was a homosexual, joined the Ice Capades as a chorus boy. That was all right with Ed, who understood that some people were born homosexual and that was that. And Bruce was so happy with the ice show. He was not only a good skater but maybe the best male or female dancer at Tarkington. Bruce used to come over to the house and dance with my mother-in-law sometimes, just for the sake of dancing. He said she was the best dance partner he had ever had, and she returned the compliment.\nI didn\u2019t tell her when, 4 years after he graduated, he was found strangled with his own belt, and with something like 100 stab wounds, in a motel outside of Dubuque. So there was Dubuque again.\n18\nSHAKESPEARE.\nI THINK WILLIAM Shakespeare was the wisest human being I ever heard of. To be perfectly frank, though, that\u2019s not saying much. We are impossibly conceited animals, and actually dumb as heck. Ask any teacher. You don\u2019t even have to ask a teacher. Ask anybody. Dogs and cats are smarter than we are.\nIf I say that the Trustees of Tarkington College were dummies, and that the people who got us involved in the Vietnam War were dummies, I hope it is understood that I consider myself the biggest dummy of all. Look at where I am now, and how hard I worked to get here and nowhere else. Bingo!\nAnd if I feel that my father was a horse\u2019s fundament and my mother was a horse\u2019s fundament, what can I be but another horse\u2019s fundament?

It was for many years the tallest structure in Midland City. A city ordinance was passed which made it illegal to erect anything taller than that, and it was called The George Hickman Bannister Law.\nThe ordinance was junked later on to allow radio towers to go up.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe two largest monuments in town, until the new Mildred Barry Memorial Arts Center went up in Sugar Creek, were constructed supposedly so that George Hickman Bannister would never be forgotten. But nobody ever thought about him anymore by the time Dwayne Hoover met Kilgore Trout. There wasn\u2019t much to think about him, actually, even at the time of his death, except that he was young.\nAnd he didn\u2019t have any relatives in town anymore. There weren\u2019t any Bannisters in the phone book, except for The Bannister, which was a motion picture theater. Actually, there wouldn\u2019t even be a Bannister Theater in there after the new phonebooks came out. The Bannister had been turned into a cut-rate furniture store.\nGeorge Hickman Bannister\u2019s father and mother and sister, Lucy, moved away from town before either the tombstone or the fieldhouse was completed, and they couldn\u2019t be located for the dedication ceremonies.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was a very restless country, with people tearing around all the time.
