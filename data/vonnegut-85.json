Axel\u2019s Castle: A Study of the Imaginative Literature of 1870\u20131930 was a heavyweight book of literary criticism by Edmund Wilson, the leading critic of the time, on the works of the great writers of the era, including T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, and Gertrude Stein. Kurt opened his Saab automobile dealership on Cape Cod in the spring of 1957, and closed it that December.

The epiphany at the end, as I recall, is that we shouldn\u2019t be seeking harrowing challenges, but rather tasks we find natural and interesting, tasks we were apparently born to perform.\n\u201cAs for the charms of physics: Two of the most entertaining subjects taught in high school or college are mechanics and optics. Beyond these playful disciplines, however, lie mind games as dependent on native talent as playing the French horn or chess.\n\u201cOf native talent itself I say in speeches: \u2018If you go to a big city, and a university is a big city, you are bound to run into Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Stay home, stay home.\u2019 \u201d\nTo put it another way: No matter what a young person thinks he or she is really hot stuff at doing, he or she is sooner or later going to run into somebody in the same field who will cut him or her a new asshole, so to speak.\nA boyhood friend of mine, William H. C. \u201cSkip\u201d Failey, who died four months ago and is up in Heaven now, had good reason when a high school sophomore to think of himself as unbeatable at Ping-Pong. I am no slouch at Ping-Pong myself, but I wouldn\u2019t play against Skip. He put so much spin on his serve that no matter how I tried to return it, I already knew it would go up my nose or out the window or back to the factory, anywhere but on the table.\nWhen Skip was a junior, though, he played a classmate of ours, Roger Downs. Skip said afterward, \u201cRoger cut me a new asshole.\u201d\nThirty-five years after that, I was lecturing at a university in Colorado, and who should be in the audience but Roger Downs! Roger had become a businessperson out that way, and a respected competitor on the Senior Men\u2019s Tennis Circuit. So I congratulated him on having given Skip a table tennis lesson so long ago.\nRoger was eager to hear anything Skip might have said after that showdown. I said, \u201cSkip said you cut him a new asshole.\u201d\nRoger was enormously satisfied, as well he might have been.\nI did not ask, but the surgical metaphor could not have been unfamiliar to him. Furthermore, life being the Darwinian experiment, or \u201ccrock of shit,\u201d as Trout liked to call it, Roger himself had surely departed more than one tennis tournament having, like Skip, undergone a colostomy to his self-regard.", 0.22852727272727272], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["soap", 0.1253952338665786], ["reports", 0.1253952338665786], ["foster", 0.12456240688799554], ["stocks", 0.11195245429378939], ["securities", 0.09648438416478625], ["herbert", 0.07974783767215476], ["dish", 0.07715304178418549], ["dingy", 0.07715304178418549], ["filet", 0.07715304178418549], ["inkstained", 0.07715304178418549], ["mmm", 0.07715304178418549], ["moistened", 0.07715304178418549], ["chips", 0.07715304178418549], ["winters", 0.07715304178418549], ["customer", 0.07715304178418549], ["hostile", 0.07715304178418549], ["mottled", 0.07715304178418549], ["handmade", 0.07715304178418549], ["reluctantly", 0.07715304178418549], ["mignon", 0.07715304178418549], ["plasterboard", 0.07715304178418549], ["jaguars", 0.07715304178418549], ["wash", 0.06803268414523883], ["silk", 0.06803268414523883], ["washed", 0.06803268414523883], ["recommend", 0.06803268414523883], ["bourbon", 0.06803268414523883], ["earlier", 0.06803268414523883], ["modest", 0.06803268414523883], ["underwear", 0.06803268414523883], ["permit", 0.06803268414523883], ["confidential", 0.0626976169332893], ["shade", 0.05891232650629219], ["florida", 0.055976227146894694], ["sell", 0.055976227146894694], ["cash", 0.055976227146894694], ["bonds", 0.053577259294342656], ["pressed", 0.053577259294342656], ["list", 0.053577259294342656], ["heavily", 0.05154896087556294], ["rules", 0.05154896087556294], ["shoes", 0.049791968867345535], ["trip", 0.049791968867345535], ["plan", 0.049791968867345535], ["promise", 0.04824219208239312], ["realized", 0.04824219208239312], ["twelve", 0.04685586950794804], ["dozen", 0.04685586950794804], ["bar", 0.04685586950794804], ["walls", 0.04560178819473324], ["buy", 0.04560178819473324], ["keeping", 0.04445690165539601], ["huh", 0.04152080229599851], ["meant", 0.04067161122839889], ["uh", 0.04067161122839889], ["wonder", 0.03987391883607738], ["sighed", 0.03987391883607738], ["leave", 0.035896538943012465], ["company", 0.03533654401644936], ["floor", 0.029290065998311993], ["year", 0.028615154230054746], ["hands", 0.028290251432813013], ["call", 0.02649320491957945], ["thought", 0.02106514866522081], ["told", 0.019997707286110698], ["thing", 0.017945019806155683], ["looked", 0.016042635216535848], ["going", 0.015185539135338984], ["good", 0.014492858431583433]], "sentiment": ["\"Yes.

Resi was bundled up in a coat and scarf and thick wool stockings. A small suitcase was beside her. When the wagon train outside was ready to move, she would be ready to board it.\nShe had taken off her mittens, laid them neatly on the arm of the chair. She had bared her hands in order to pet the dog in her lap. The dog was a dachshund that had, on a wartime diet, lost all its hair and been all but immobilized by dropsical fat.\nThe dog looked like some early amphibian meant to waddle in ooze. While Resi caressed it, its brown eyes bugged with the blindness of ecstasy. Every bit of its awareness followed like thimbles the fingertips that stroked its hide.\nI did not know Resi well. She had chilled me once, fairly early in the war, by lispingly calling me an American spy. Since then, I had spent as little time as possible before her childish gaze.

He himself hired a room at the Hotel El Dorado, the same room which would later be occupied by Selena MacIntosh and her dog. On the advice of police he took the girls to an orphanage next door to the cathedral downtown, where nuns gladly accepted responsibility for them. There was still plenty of food for everyone.\nXim\u00e9nez then went to the hotel, and he told the story to the bartender there, who was Jes\u00fas Ortiz, the same man who would later disconnect all the telephones from the outside world.\nSo Xim\u00e9nez was one aviator who had quite a lot to do with the future of humanity. And another one was an American named Paul W. Tibbets. It was Tibbets who had dropped an atomic bomb on Hisako Hiroguchi\u2019s mother during World War Two. People would probably be as furry as they are today, even if Tibbets hadn\u2019t dropped the bomb. But they certainly got furrier faster because of him.\nThe orphanage put out a call for anybody who could speak Kanka-bono, to serve as an interpreter. An old drunk and petty thief appeared, a purebred white man who, amazingly, was a grandfather of the lightest of the girls. When a youngster, he had gone prospecting for valuable minerals in the rain forest, and had lived with the Kanka-bonos for three years. He had welcomed Father Fitzgerald to the tribe when the priest first arrived from Ireland.\nHis name was Domingo Quezeda, and he was from excellent stock. His father had been head of the Philosophy Department of the Central University in Quito. If they were so inclined, then, people today might claim to be descended from a long line of aristocratic Spanish intellectuals.\nWhen I was a little boy in Cohoes, and could detect nothing in the life of our little family about which I could be proud, my mother told me that I had the blood of French noblemen flowing in my veins. I would probably be living in a chateau on a vast estate over there, she said, if it hadn\u2019t been for the French Revolution. That was on her side of the family. I was also somehow related through her, she went on, to Carter Braxton, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. I should hold my head up high, she said, because of the blood flowing in my veins.\nI thought that was pretty good. So then I disturbed my father at his typewriter, and asked him what my heritage was from his side of the family. I didn\u2019t know then what sperm was, and so wouldn\u2019t understand his answer for several years. \u201cMy boy,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are descended from a long line of determined, resourceful, microscopic tadpoles\u2014champions every one.\u201d\nOld Quezeda, stinking like a battlefield, told the girls that they could trust only him, which was easy enough for them to believe, since he was the grandfather of one and the only person who would converse with them. They had to believe everything he said. They were without the means to be skeptical, since their new environment had nothing in common with the rain forest. They had many truths they were prepared to defend stubbornly and proudly, but none of them applied to anything they had so far seen in Guayaquil, except for one, a classically fatal belief in urban areas a million years ago: Relatives would never want to hurt them. Quezeda in fact wished to expose them to terrible dangers as thieves and beggars, and, as soon as was remotely possible, as prostitutes. He would do this in order to feed his big brain\u2019s thirst for self-esteem and alcohol. He was at last going to be a man of wealth and importance.\nHe took the girls on walks around the city, showing them, as far as the nuns at the orphanage were aware, the parks and the cathedral and the museums and so on. He was in fact teaching them what was hateful about tourists, and where to find them and how to fool them, and where they were most likely to keep their valuables. And they played the game of spotting policemen before policemen spotted them, and memorizing good hiding places in the downtown area, should any enemy try to catch them.\nIt was \u201cjust pretend\u201d for the girls\u2019 first week in the city. But then Grandfather Domingo Quezeda and the girls, as far as the nuns and the police were concerned, vanished entirely. That vile old ancestor of all humanity had moved the girls into an empty shed by the water-front\u2014a shed, as it happened, belonging to one of the two older cruise ships with which the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was meant to compete. The shed was empty because tourism had declined to the point where the old ship was out of business.", 0.1052445211038961], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["white", 0.12568524479032953], ["allison", 0.12111315877924905], ["presentable", 0.11611436766457119], ["boys", 0.076735038670548], ["hate", 0.07334711164137749], ["perked", 0.05805718383228559], ["features", 0.05805718383228559], ["uneducated", 0.05805718383228559], ["misread", 0.05805718383228559], ["ransacked", 0.05805718383228559], ["redecorate", 0.05805718383228559], ["brightened", 0.05805718383228559], ["blobs", 0.05805718383228559], ["broached", 0.05805718383228559], ["unsophisticated", 0.05805718383228559], ["salvage", 0.05805718383228559], ["black", 0.05659678082715997], ["sold", 0.05384594252047853], ["trim", 0.05044018184811037], ["hobnobbing", 0.05044018184811037], ["ruined", 0.05044018184811037], ["deserve", 0.05044018184811037], ["nightmare", 0.05044018184811037], ["statement", 0.05044018184811037], ["hoping", 0.05044018184811037], ["kennedy", 0.05044018184811037], ["jackie", 0.05044018184811037], ["college", 0.04598452131944922], ["easier", 0.04598452131944922], ["imaginative", 0.04598452131944922], ["discuss", 0.04598452131944922], ["midst", 0.04282317986393515], ["lot", 0.04136277685880952], ["relationship", 0.04037105292641636], ["southampton", 0.04037105292641636], ["figure", 0.038367519335274], ["evidently", 0.038367519335274], ["subject", 0.038367519335274], ["power", 0.038367519335274], ["suppose", 0.038367519335274], ["problem", 0.03667355582068874], ["simple", 0.03520617787975992], ["rothko", 0.03520617787975992], ["stood", 0.03275405094224113], ["realize", 0.03275405094224113], ["brown", 0.03275405094224113], ["hair", 0.03170668632900679], ["leaving", 0.03170668632900679], ["sounded", 0.03170668632900679], ["perfectly", 0.030750517351098773], ["wonderful", 0.029870927156884088], ["famous", 0.02905655383651352], ["nice", 0.027589175895584697], ["finally", 0.026922971260239265], ["foyer", 0.026922971260239265], ["widow", 0.026922971260239265], ["collection", 0.026294856822437627], ["mind", 0.02570071153375328], ["women", 0.024089684344831573], ["celeste", 0.023133515366923547], ["door", 0.023133515366923547], ["men", 0.022253925172708862], ["paul", 0.02183919629377648], ["person", 0.02143955185233829], ["cook", 0.02068138842940476], ["paintings", 0.02032106070607519], ["night", 0.019634023816170423], ["city", 0.018987424914819504], ["woman", 0.017520046973890684], ["york", 0.017248699582787703], ["slazinger", 0.01698389132367715], ["painting", 0.016225727900743614], ["art", 0.013822549868163071], ["life", 0.013822549868163071], ["house", 0.012528230795016], ["man", 0.011851770432384862], ["berman", 0.011528540924623399], ["people", 0.011060852854087179], ["time", 0.008130867543604226]], "sentiment": ["\u201cSo everybody\u2019s leaving now,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Paul Slazinger?\u201d\n\u201cOut the door,\u201d said Celeste.\nWhat had I done to deserve this?

novelists are not only unusually depressed, by/and large, but have, on the average, about the same IQs as the cosmetics consultants at Bloomingdale\u2019s department store. Our power is patience. We have discovered that writing allows even a stupid person to seem halfway intelligent, if only that person will write the same thought over and over again, improving it just a little bit each time. It is a lot like inflating a blimp with a bicycle pump. Anybody can do it. All it takes is time.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI heard a Frenchman in a Madison Avenue bookstore say in English the other day that nobody in America had produced a book in forty years or more. I knew what he meant. He was talking about planetary literary treasures on the order of Moby Dick or Huckleberry Finn or Leaves of Grass or Walden, say. I had to agree with him. No book from this country during my lifetime (1922-?) has been in scale with Ulysses or Remembrance of Things Past or The Tin Drum or One Hundred Years of Solitude or A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch.\nStill, now that I contemplate all the Americans on my list of friends, I wish the Frenchman were here so that I could say to him frostily: \u201cYou are quite right, mon-sewer, we have not produced a book. All we poor Americans could do was produce a literature.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd here is how I spoke well of my friend Joseph Heller\u2019s contributions to that literature in The New York Times Book Review of Sunday, October 6, 1974:\nThe company that made a movie out of Joseph Heller\u2019s first novel, Catch-22, had to assemble what became the 11th or 12th largest bomber force on the planet at the time. If somebody wants to make a movie out of his second novel, Something Happened, he can get most of his props at Bloom-ingdale\u2019s\u2014a few beds, a few desks, some tables and chairs.\nLife is a whole lot smaller and cheaper in this second book. It has shrunk to the size of a grave, almost.\nMark Twain is said to have felt that his existence was all pretty much downhill from his adventures as a Mississippi riverboat pilot. Mr. Heller\u2019s two novels, when considered in sequence, might be taken as a similar statement about an entire white, middle-class generation of American males, my generation, Mr. Heller\u2019s generation, Herman Wouk\u2019s generation, Norman Mailer\u2019s generation, Irwin Shaw\u2019s generation, Vance Bourjaily\u2019s generation, James Jones\u2019s generation, and on and on\u2014that for them everything has been downhill since World War II, as absurd and bloody as it often was.\nBoth books are full of excellent jokes, but neither one is funny. Taken together they tell a tale of pain and disappointments experienced by mediocre men of good will.", 0.06887472283813748], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["driver", 0.24734927909937143], ["227", 0.19580376914616254], ["amy", 0.15306344846956532], ["building", 0.14808674501038518], ["yard", 0.11748226148769753], ["map", 0.10447800503808559], ["224", 0.10447800503808559], ["wasteland", 0.0913997563482753], ["dogs", 0.08374947128963069], ["passenger", 0.07832150765846502], ["bus", 0.06302093754117578], ["railroad", 0.06302093754117578], ["stove", 0.052239002519042795], ["lanterns", 0.052239002519042795], ["southern", 0.052239002519042795], ["slag", 0.052239002519042795], ["constellation", 0.052239002519042795], ["scrap", 0.052239002519042795], ["tundra", 0.052239002519042795], ["cops", 0.052239002519042795], ["eared", 0.052239002519042795], ["rusting", 0.052239002519042795], ["beams", 0.052239002519042795], ["heaps", 0.052239002519042795], ["potbellied", 0.052239002519042795], ["works", 0.04994268885136551], ["barrels", 0.04569987817413765], ["fairly", 0.04569987817413765], ["sand", 0.04569987817413765], ["pretty", 0.0437444989084969], ["call", 0.04300448545277461], ["flashlight", 0.04187473564481534], ["relief", 0.04187473564481534], ["visor", 0.03916075382923251], ["stenographer", 0.03916075382923251], ["shipping", 0.03916075382923251], ["square", 0.03705562598664562], ["pointing", 0.03705562598664562], ["dancing", 0.03705562598664562], ["crossing", 0.03705562598664562], ["girl", 0.03686444016155521], ["bunch", 0.035335611299910204], ["sun", 0.035335611299910204], ["tiny", 0.035335611299910204], ["finger", 0.035335611299910204], ["pride", 0.035335611299910204], ["absently", 0.035335611299910204], ["happily", 0.033881359603426635], ["affectionate", 0.033881359603426635], ["edge", 0.03262162948432736], ["broke", 0.03151046877058789], ["dog", 0.03151046877058789], ["late", 0.030516501641740478], ["pool", 0.030516501641740478], ["close", 0.029617349002077038], ["board", 0.029617349002077038], ["sighed", 0.029617349002077038], ["department", 0.028796486955005057], ["middle", 0.02608250513942222], ["heart", 0.02608250513942222], ["looked", 0.02600851289922386], ["care", 0.024971344425682756], ["started", 0.023977377296835335], ["office", 0.023517092729199184], ["street", 0.023517092729199184], ["talking", 0.02265886840650365], ["work", 0.020803110913616345], ["night", 0.018971450400022405], ["called", 0.018971450400022405], ["thought", 0.014963118381482163], ["big", 0.012857990538895279], ["good", 0.011507982580021002], ["man", 0.008794000764438162]], "sentiment": ["\u201cCould you please let me out at building 227?\u201d said Amy to the driver. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it is.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know as I know where it is, either,\u201d said the driver. \u201cDon\u2019t get much call for that one.\u201d He took a dog-eared map of the works down from the sun visor.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get any call for that one,\u201d said a passenger. \u201cNothing in 227 but a bunch of lanterns, some barrels of sand, and maybe a potbellied stove.

I told Sarah as much, and she replied, \u201cThat is the story of my life. I always go in the wrong door first.\u201d\nSo Sarah and I went out into the night again and then in through the door to the place where food and drink awaited us. Mr. McCone had told me to order the meal in advance. That I had done. The owner himself received us. He was French. On the lapel of his tuxedo was a decoration that meant nothing to me, but which was familiar to Sarah, since her father had one, too. It meant, she would explain to me, that he was a chevalier in the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur.\nSarah had spent many summers in Europe. I had never been there. She was fluent in French, and she and the owner performed a madrigal in that most melodious of all languages. How would I ever have got through life without women to act as my interpreters? Of the four women I ever loved, only Mary Kathleen O\u2019Looney spoke no language but English. But even Mary Kathleen was my interpreter when I was a Harvard communist, trying to communicate with members of the American working class.\nThe restaurant owner told Sarah in French, and then she told me, about the Great Depression\u2019s being nothing but a loss of nerve. He said that alcoholic beverages would be legal again as soon as a Democrat was elected President, and that life would become fun again.\nHe led us to our table. The room could seat at least one hundred, I would guess, but there were only a dozen other patrons there. Somehow, they still had cash. And when I try to remember them now, and to guess what they were, I keep seeing the pictures by George Grosz of corrupt plutocrats amidst the misery of Germany after World War One. I had not seen those pictures in Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-one. I had not seen anything.\nThere was a puffy old woman, I remember, eating alone and wearing a diamond necklace.

The story wasn\u2019t to be about \u201cPapa\u201d Monzano or Frank. It was to be about Julian Castle, an American sugar millionaire who had, at the age of forty, followed the example of Dr. Albert Schweitzer by founding a free hospital in a jungle, by devoting his life to miserable folk of another race.\nCastle\u2019s hospital was called the House of Hope and Mercy in the Jungle. Its jungle was on San Lorenzo, among the wild coffee trees on the northern slope of Mount McCabe.\nWhen I flew to San Lorenzo, Julian Castle was sixty years old.\nHe had been absolutely unselfish for twenty years.\nIn his selfish days he had been as familiar to tabloid readers as Tommy Manville, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Barbara Hutton. His fame had rested on lechery, alcoholism, reckless driving, and draft evasion. He had had a dazzling talent for spending millions without increasing mankind\u2019s stores of anything but chagrin.\nHe had been married five times, had produced one son.\nThe one son, Philip Castle, was the manager and owner of the hotel at which I planned to stay. The hotel was called the Casa Mona and was named after Mona Aamons Monzano, the blonde Negro on the cover of the supplement to the New York Sunday Times. The Casa Mona was brand new; it was one of the three new buildings in the background of the supplement\u2019s portrait of Mona.\nWhile I didn\u2019t feel that purposeful seas were wafting me to San Lorenzo, I did feel that love was doing the job. The Fata Morgana, the mirage of what it would be like to be loved by Mona Aamons Monzano, had become a tremendous force in my meaningless life. I imagined that she could make me far happier than any woman had so far succeeded in doing.\n41\nA KARASS BUILT FOR TWO", 0.11587121212121214], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["civic", 0.19685478592715813], ["managers", 0.1209840006559236], ["military", 0.10076851601473787], ["bridge", 0.09648591435385845], ["jacket", 0.08294587390009327], ["side", 0.06596604152434091], ["thursdays", 0.06561826197571938], ["abusively", 0.06561826197571938], ["perfunctory", 0.06561826197571938], ["traditionally", 0.06561826197571938], ["schism", 0.06561826197571938], ["bureaucracy", 0.06561826197571938], ["monolithic", 0.06561826197571938], ["administrators", 0.06561826197571938], ["overwhelm", 0.06561826197571938], ["leprosarium", 0.06561826197571938], ["arisen", 0.06561826197571938], ["suspicious", 0.05800125999154415], ["share", 0.05800125999154415], ["traded", 0.05800125999154415], ["bureaucrats", 0.05800125999154415], ["thursday", 0.05800125999154415], ["groups", 0.05800125999154415], ["contact", 0.05800125999154415], ["dated", 0.05800125999154415], ["changes", 0.05800125999154415], ["comfortable", 0.053545599462883], ["unable", 0.053545599462883], ["habit", 0.053545599462883], ["suspiciously", 0.05038425800736893], ["trunk", 0.05038425800736893], ["business", 0.04908993893422185], ["car", 0.04908993893422185], ["efficiency", 0.04592859747870778], ["coat", 0.04592859747870778], ["sake", 0.04423463396412253], ["stuck", 0.04423463396412253], ["heads", 0.04276725602319371], ["works", 0.042378254328701376], ["wagon", 0.04031512908567491], ["early", 0.039267764472440576], ["career", 0.039267764472440576], ["industry", 0.039267764472440576], ["dinner", 0.039267764472440576], ["ilium", 0.03817923813611436], ["lived", 0.03743200530031787], ["worked", 0.036617631979947295], ["economy", 0.03585946855701377], ["bed", 0.03515025403901848], ["wondered", 0.03385593496587141], ["city", 0.033261789677187056], ["bar", 0.033261789677187056], ["booth", 0.03269812710149969], ["club", 0.03216197145128615], ["question", 0.03165076248826535], ["stopped", 0.031162281580893545], ["short", 0.030694593510357332], ["station", 0.0302460001639809], ["engineers", 0.02824246657283854], ["baer", 0.027195101959604204], ["river", 0.026238932981696182], ["war", 0.025359342787481497], ["finnerty", 0.024944613908549112], ["job", 0.021581633566571338], ["big", 0.02138362801159685], ["left", 0.02081015819653564], ["long", 0.020089308938449776], ["thought", 0.019250045435322594], ["will", 0.01862193099752096], ["things", 0.01832084336908014], ["kroner", 0.015234003968350448], ["paul", 0.013096200994240446]], "sentiment": ["Finnerty had come over in Paul\u2019s station wagon.

The question had arisen: who was to run it, the bureaucrats, the heads of business and industry, or the military?
