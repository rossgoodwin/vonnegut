For you to make any money from it you have to give strangers a reason to spend money on it: because you are famous, or highly trained and experienced in helping others deal with life, or you converse regularly with God, or whatever. From the very first, you yourself declare yourself ignorant and undistinguished amd uninvolved in helping others, a sort of charming thing to do, I guess, but surely no inducement for a browsing stranger, troubled or not, to buy a book.\nWhat shows is your longtime involvement with standup comedians. This is their kind of material, their kind of delivery. They do have authority, by God, since they have wound up in front of an audience, are in person, not ink on paper, and are known to entertain with highly idiosyncratic, off-the-wall ideas and a twanging stage presence. I have often thought that you might become a first rate standup. And now I imagine your doing the bit about which of two things I would hit with a shovel. Perfect. And about the cardboard sex symbol in the record store, with your two boys looking at a lava lamp, and on and on.\nBut you have to be alive and desperate in front of a mike in a club, or you can\u2019t get away with it. Or such is my opinion, and I agree with what you say about opinions, that they are \u201cnot stuff,\u201d and thus famously insubstantial and subject to change. So it is quite possible that a publisher will see in this a goldmine. So by all means show it around, or find an agent willing to do that.\nLove and respect as always\u2014", 0.23458787878787882], "title": "Letters"}}
