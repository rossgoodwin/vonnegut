hear from you. You are a sort of flywheel on my reputation, mentioning me often even when I myself am as silent as a tomb. The Darwinian novel, Galapagos, has been a perfect son-of-a-bitch, since I have to be responsible as a biologist as well as a story-teller. I have taken the thing apart and reassembled it a thousand times. I am reminded of a dream car called the \u201cTucker Torpedo\u201d which was to be produced after the Second World War, an early DeLorean. The headlights were supposed to turn with the front wheels and so on. It was a stock swindle, and one of the company\u2019s engineers testified about the prototype they built and showed around the country on a platform, that the only time they started it, it went \u201cchugga-chugga-chug,\u201d and died. He said that, as far as he knew, it couldn\u2019t even back up. That is the condition of most of what I\u2019ve produced in the past two years. I think maybe things are going a little bit better now. I\u2019ve rented a studio down in Greenwich Village, on MacDougal Alley, where my daughter Edith, the painter, comes to paint for a couple of hours a day. That is easy companionship. I take a cab to work each morning, and then walk home every afternoon. The walk takes a lazy, window-shopping hour.\nAs for Japan: I\u2019m not going to get any prize over there. I am to be a speaker at an international convention of P.E.N., and a guest of the Tokyo Chapter. I told my hosts that I wanted to see some potters and printmakers out in the countryside while I was there, so the Association of Japanese Graphic Artists is going to take me around for four days, in exchange for which I must give their annual convention, coinciding with the P.E.N. conference, a speech. Done and done. I leave here on May 8 (V-E Day), and return on the 20th, no doubt all pooped out.

except to say that you would set up your problem on paper, turn dials and switches that would get him ready to solve that kind of problem, then feed numbers into him with a keyboard that looked something like a typewriter. The answers came out typed on a paper ribbon fed from a big spool. It took EPICAC a split second to solve problems fifty Einsteins couldn\u2019t handle in a lifetime. And EPICAC never forgot any piece of information that was given to him. Clickety-click, out came some ribbon, and there you were.\nThere were a lot of problems the Brass wanted solved in a hurry, so, the minute EPICAC\u2019s last tube was in place, he was put to work sixteen hours a day with two eight-hour shifts of operators. Well, it didn\u2019t take long to find out that he was a good bit below his specifications. He did a more complete and faster job than any other computer all right, but nothing like what his size and special features seemed to promise. He was sluggish, and the clicks of his answers had a funny irregularity, sort of a stammer. We cleaned his contacts a dozen times, checked and double-checked his circuits, replaced every one of his tubes, but nothing helped. Von Kleigstadt was in one hell of a state.\nWell, as I said, we went ahead and used EPICAC anyway. My wife, the former Pat Kilgallen, and I worked with him on the night shift, from five in the afternoon until two in the morning. Pat wasn\u2019t my wife then. Far from it.\nThat\u2019s how I came to talk with EPICAC in the first place. I loved Pat Kilgallen. She is a brown-eyed strawberry blond who looked very warm and soft to me, and later proved to be exactly that. She was\u2014still is\u2014a crackerjack mathematician, and she kept our relationship strictly professional. I\u2019m a mathematician, too, and that, according to Pat, was why we could never be happily married.\nI\u2019m not shy. That wasn\u2019t the trouble. I knew what I wanted, and was willing to ask for it, and did so several times a month. \"Pat, loosen up and marry me.\"\nOne night, she didn\u2019t even look up from her work when I said it. \"So romantic, so poetic,\" she murmured, more to her control panel than to me. \"That\u2019s the way with mathematicians\u2014all hearts and flowers.\" She closed a switch. \"I could get more warmth out of a sack of frozen CO2.\"\n\"Well, how should I say it?\" I said, a little sore. Frozen CO2, in case you don\u2019t know, is dry ice. I\u2019m as romantic as the next guy, I think. It\u2019s a question of singing so sweet and having it come out so sour. I never seem to pick the right words.\n\"Try and say it sweetly,\" she said sarcastically. \"Sweep me off my feet. Go ahead.\"\n\"Darling, angel, beloved, will you please marry me?\" It was no go\u2014hopeless, ridiculous. \"Dammit, Pat, please marry me!\"\nShe continued to twiddle her dials placidly. \"You\u2019re sweet, but you won\u2019t do.\"", 0.1781304112554112], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
