in a steel mill, in a rope factory. He was an ardent reader. He studied Marx and Darwin and Hugo and Gorki and Tolstoi and Zola and Dante. That much he had in common with Harvard men. In Nineteen-hundred and Sixteen he led a strike against the rope factory, which was The Plymouth Cordage Company in Plymouth, Massachusetts, now a subsidiary of RAMJAC. He was blacklisted by places of work far and wide after that, and became a self-employed peddler of fish to survive.\nAnd it was in Nineteen-hundred and Sixteen that Sacco and Vanzetti came to know each other well. It became evident to both of them, thinking independently, but thinking always of the brutality of business practices, that the battlefields of World War One were simply additional places of hideously dangerous work, where a few men could supervise the wasting of millions of lives in the hopes of making money. It was clear to them, too, that America would soon become involved. They did not wish to be compelled to work in such factories in Europe, so they both joined the same small group of Italian-American anarchists that went to Mexico until the war was over.\nAnarchists are persons who believe with all their hearts that governments are enemies of their own people.\nI find myself thinking even now that the story of Sacco and Vanzetti may yet enter the bones of future generations. Perhaps it needs to be told only a few more times. If so, then the flight into Mexico will be seen by one and all as yet another expression of a very holy sort of common sense.\nBe that as it may: Sacco and Vanzetti returned to Massachusetts after the war, fast friends. Their sort of common sense, holy, or not, and based on books Harvard men read routinely and without ill effects, had always seemed contemptible to most of their neighbors. Those same neighbors, and those who liked to guide their destinies without much opposition, now decided to be terrified by that common sense, especially when it was possessed by the foreign-born.\nThe Department of Justice drew up secret lists of foreigners who made no secret whatsoever about how unjust and self-deceiving and ignorant and greedy they thought so many of the leaders were in the so-called \u201cPromised Land.\u201d Sacco and Vanzetti were on the list. They were shadowed by government spies.\nA printer named Andrea Salsedo, who was a friend of Vanzetti\u2019s, was also on the list. He was arrested in New York City by federal agents on unspecified charges, and held incommunicado for eight weeks. On May third of Nineteen-hundred and Twenty, Salsedo fell or jumped or was pushed out of the fourteenth-story window of an office maintained by the Department of Justice.\nSacco and Vanzetti organized a meeting that was to demand an investigation of the arrest and death of Salsedo. It was scheduled for May ninth in Brockton, Massachusetts, Mary Kathleen O\u2019Looney\u2019s home town. Mary Kathleen was then six years old. I was seven.\nSacco and Vanzetti were arrested for dangerous radical activities before the meeting could take place. Their crime was the possession of leaflets calling for the meeting. The penalities could be stiff fines and up to a year in jail.\nBut then they were suddenly charged with two unsolved murders, too. Two payroll guards had been shot dead during a robbery in South Braintree, Massachusetts, about a month before.", -0.006168831168831165], "title": "Jailbird"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf":

war, every Martian had been killed, wounded, captured, or been found missing.\nNot a soul was left on Mars. Not a building was left standing on Mars.\nThe last waves of Martians to attack Earth were, to the horror of the Earthlings who pot-shotted them, old men, women, and a few little children.\nThe Martians arrived in the most brilliantly-conceived space vehicles ever known in the Solar System. And, as long as the Martian troops had their real commanders to radio-control them, they fought with a steadfastness, selflessness, and a will to close with the enemy that won the grudging admiration of everyone who fought them.\nIt was frequently the case, however, that the troops lost their real commanders, either in the air or on the ground. When that happened, the troops became sluggish at once.\nTheir biggest trouble, however, was that they were scarcely better armed than a big-city police department. They fought with firearms, grenades, knives, mortars, and small rocket-launchers. They had no nuclear weapons, no tanks, no medium or heavy artillery, no air cover, and no transport once they hit the ground.\nThe Martian troops, moreover, had no control over where their ships were to land. Their ships were controlled by fully automatic pilot-navigators, and these electronic devices were set by technicians on Mars so as to make the ships land at particular points on Earth, regardless of how awful the military situation might be down there.\nThe only controls available to those on board were two push-buttons on the center post of the cabin\u2014one labeled on and one labeled off. The on button simply started a flight from Mars. The off button was connected to nothing. It was installed at the insistence of Martian mental-health experts, who said that human beings were always happier with machinery they thought they could turn off.\nThe war between Earth and Mars began when 500 Martian Imperial Commandos took possession of the Earthling moon on April 23. They were unopposed. The only Earthlings on the moon at the time were 18 Americans in the Jefferson Observatory, 53 Russians in the Lenin Observatory, and four Danish geologists at large in the Mare Imbrium.\nThe Martians announced their presence by radio to Earth, demanded Earth\u2019s surrender. And they gave Earth what they described as \"a taste of hell.\"", -0.030789399092970526], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["quail", 0.2276143781729624], ["ren", 0.2276143781729624], ["marks", 0.2276143781729624], ["fearless", 0.2276143781729624], ["64", 0.1998884909505646], ["sharks", 0.1998884909505646], ["toe", 0.1998884909505646], ["zo", 0.18366988662623804], ["fail", 0.18366988662623804], ["enemies", 0.18366988662623804], ["reverent", 0.18366988662623804], ["rich", 0.1721626037281668], ["pure", 0.1632368616755984], ["lo", 0.1559439994038402], ["lucky", 0.1559439994038402], ["will", 0.15069575716429925], ["women", 0.14443671650576898], ["free", 0.12501640387450094], ["san", 0.11650023597814407], ["island", 0.1004922249590446], ["children", 0.09432619776595426], ["men", 0.09025488999355658], ["people", 0.04990832791334976]], "sentiment": ["And the men are as fearless as sharks;\nThe women are pure,\nAnd we always are sure\nThat our children will all toe their marks.\nSan, San Lo-ren-zo!\nWhat a rich, lucky island are we!\nOur enemies quail,\nFor they know they will fail\nAgainst people so reverent and free.\n64", 0.25515873015873014], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["police", 0.15523866644795636], ["flaw", 0.1170835654860875], ["downtown", 0.1170835654860875], ["downward", 0.1170835654860875], ["umm", 0.1034924442986376], ["muzzle", 0.1034924442986376], ["register", 0.1034924442986376], ["habit", 0.0955421480612226], ["pit", 0.0955421480612226], ["knew", 0.09363697652291578], ["rod", 0.08990132311118769], ["inches", 0.08990132311118769], ["night", 0.08666908721948628], ["tiny", 0.0819510268737727], ["kroner", 0.08154672712469944], ["slid", 0.07892846452421862], ["cleaning", 0.07892846452421862], ["month", 0.07631020192373777], ["hmmm", 0.07631020192373777], ["bore", 0.0740007306363577], ["drove", 0.07193483817247875], ["pointed", 0.070066011117492], ["patch", 0.070066011117492], ["gun", 0.06835990568632279], ["trouble", 0.06271908073628787], ["uh", 0.06153036266145581], ["huh", 0.060409609448907796], ["idea", 0.055603286742378674], ["yessir", 0.05319931964252903], ["homestead", 0.05245931321149282], ["held", 0.04912795954883796], ["sir", 0.047939241474005904], ["find", 0.04628125347345565], ["finnerty", 0.044509016974077824], ["told", 0.04288376874259218], ["face", 0.03960819845507912], ["lasher", 0.039234704436045896], ["job", 0.03850840499133317], ["left", 0.03713185089970084], ["thought", 0.034348120286556], ["paul", 0.017525798389351182], ["man", 0.016730745634778575]], "sentiment": ["Kroner drove the cleaning rod downward. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ed Finnerty, by the way?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know, sir.\u201d\n\u201cPolice are looking for him.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\nKroner slid the patch back and forth and didn\u2019t look at Paul. \u201cUh-huh.

She told the Captain to try to call for help with it.\nThe Captain didn\u2019t know the instrument was a Mandarax. He thought it was a Gokubi, and he had a Gokubi in his handkerchief drawer, along with some cuff links and shirt studs and watches, in his house back in Quito. His brother had given it to him the previous Christmas, but he hadn\u2019t found it useful. To him, it was just another toy, and he knew this much about it: that it was certainly not a radio.\nNow he weighed what he thought was a Gokubi in his hand, and he said to Mary, \u201cI would give my right arm to have this piece of junk be a radio. I promise you, though, not even the saintly Willard Flemming could send or receive a message with a Gokubi.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time you stopped being so absolutely certain about so much!\u201d said Mary.\n\u201cThat thought has occurred to me,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThen send an SOS,\u201d said Mary. \u201cWhat harm can it do?\u201d\n\u201cNo harm, surely,\u201d said the Captain: \u201cMrs. Flemming, you are absolutely right. It can surely do no harm.\u201d He spoke into the tiny microphone of Mandarax, saying the international word for a ship in distress a million years ago: \u201cMayday, Mayday, Mayday,\u201d he intoned.\nHe then held the screen of Mandarax so that he and Mary might both read any reply which might appear there. As it happened, they had tapped into that part of the instrument\u2019s intellect, lacking in Gokubi, which knew so many quotations on every conceivable subject, including the month of May.

The only things Eliot ever bought him were a cheap phonograph and a set of German lessons on records. Ewald wanted so much to learn German, but he was too excited and angry all the time.\nEliot couldn't remember Ewald's name, either, and nearly passed him by without seeing him. His sinister little leper's booth there in the ruin of a great civilization was easy to miss.\n\"Heil Hitler,\" said Ewald in a grackle voice.\nEliot stopped, looked amiably at the place from which the greeting had come. Ewald's booth was curtained by copies of The American Investigator. The curtains seemed to be polka-dotted. The polka dots were the belly-buttons of Randy Herald, the cover girl. And she asked over and over again for a man who could give her a baby that would be a genius.\n\"Heil Hitler,\" said Ewald again. He did not part the curtains.\n\"And Heil Hitler to you, sir,\" said Eliot smiling, \"and good-bye.\"\nThe barbaric sunshine slammed Eliot as he stepped from the Parthenon. His momentarily injured eyes saw two loafers on the courthouse steps as charred stickmen surrounded by steam. He heard Bella, down in her beauty nook, bawling out a woman for not taking good care of her fingernails.\nEliot encountered no one for quite a while, although he did catch someone peeking at him from a window. He winked and waved to whomever it was. When he reached Noah Rosewater Memorial High School, which was closed tight for the summer, he paused before the flagpole, indulged himself in shallow melancholy. He was taken by the sounds of the hollow iron pole's being tapped and caressed despondently by the hardware on the empty halyard.\nHe wanted to comment on the sounds, to have someone else listen to them, too. But there was nobody around but a dog that had been following him, so he spoke to the dog. \"That's such an American sound, you know? School out and the flag down? Such a sad American sound. You should hear it sometime when the sun's gone down, and a light evening wind comes up, and it's suppertime all around the world.\"\nA lump grew in his throat.

dinky words that everybody can spell and truly understand. Mr. Hotchner, was it a frazzled wreck? My own is a tossed salad of instant coffee and tobacco crumbs and India paper, and anybody seeing it might fairly conclude that I ransack it hourly for a vocabulary like Arnold J. Toynbee\u2019s. The truth is that I have broken its spine looking up the difference between principle and principal, and how to spell cashmere. It is a dear leviathan left to me by my father, \"Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language,\" based on the \"International Dictionary\" of 1890 and 1900. It doesn\u2019t have radar in it, or Wernher von Braun or sulfathiazole, but I know what they are. One time I actually took sulfathiazole.\nAnd now I have this enormous and beautiful new bomb from Random House. I don\u2019t mean \"bomb\" in a pejorative sense, or in any dictionary sense, for that matter. I mean that the book is heavy and pregnant, and makes you think. One of the things it makes you think is that any gang of bright people with scads of money behind them can become appalling competitors in the American-unabridged-dictionary industry. They can make certain that they have all the words the other dictionaries have, then add words which have joined the language since the others were published, and then avoid mistakes that the others have caught particular hell for.\nRandom House has thrown in a color atlas of the world, as well, and concise dictionaries of French, Spanish, German, and Italian. And would you look at the price? And, lawsy me, Christmas is coming.\nWhen Mario Pei reviewed the savagely-bopped third revised edition of the \"Merriam-Webster\" for The Times in 1961, he complained of the \"residual prudishness\" which still excluded certain four-letter words, \"despite their copious appearance in numerous works of contemporary \u2019literature\u2019 as well as on restroom walls.\" Random House has satisfied this complaint somewhat. They haven\u2019t included enough of the words to allow a Pakistani to decode \"Last Exit to Brooklyn,\" or \"Ulysses,\" either\u2014but they have made brave beginnings, dealing, wisely I think, with the alimentary canal. I found only one abrupt verb for sexually congressing a woman, and we surely have Edward Albee to thank for its currency, though he gets no credit for it. The verb is hump, as in \"hump the hostess.\"\nIf my emphasis on dirty words so early in this review seems childish, I can only reply that I, as a child, would never have started going through unabridged dictionaries if I hadn\u2019t suspected that there were dirty words hidden in there, where only grownups were supposed to find them. I always ended the searches feeling hot and stuffy inside, and looking at the queer illustrations\u2014at the trammel wheel, the arbalest, and the dugong.\nOf course, one dictionary is as good as another to most people, who use them for spellers and bet-settlers and accessories to crossword puzzles and Scrabble games. But some people use them for more than that, or mean to. This was brought home to me only the other evening, whilst I was supping with the novelist and short-story writer Richard Yates, and Prof. Robert Scholes, the famous praiser of John Barth\u2019s \"Giles Goat-Boy.\" Yates asked Scholes, anxiously it seemed to me, which unabridged dictionary he should buy. He had just received a gorgeous grant for creative writing from the Federal Gumment, and the first thing he was going to buy was his entire language between hard covers. He was afraid that he might get a clunker\u2014a word, by the way, not in this Random House job.\nScholes replied judiciously that Yates should get the second edition of the \"Merriam-Webster,\" which was prescriptive rather than descriptive. Prescriptive, as nearly as I could tell, was like an honest cop, and descriptive was like a boozed-up war buddy from Mobile, Ala. Yates said he would get the tough one; but, my goodness, he doesn\u2019t need official instructions in English any more than he needs training wheels on his bicycle. As Scholes said later, Yates is the sort of man lexicographers read in order to discover what pretty new things the language is up to.\nTo find out in a rush whether a dictionary is prescriptive or descriptive, you look up ain\u2019t and like. I learned this trick of horseback logomachy from reviews of the \"Merriam-Webster\" third edition. And here is the rundown on ain\u2019t: the \"Merriam-Webster\" first edition says that it is colloquial or illiterate, the second says it is dialect or illiterate, and the third says that ain\u2019t is, \"though disapproved by many and more common in less educated speech, used orally ... by many cultivated speakers esp. in the phrase ain\u2019t I.\" I submit that this nation is so uniformly populated by parvenus with the heebie-jeebies that the phrase ain\u2019t I is heard about as frequently as the mating cry of the heath hen.\nRandom House says this about ain\u2019t: \"Ain\u2019t is so traditionally and widely regarded as a nonstandard form that it should be shunned by all who prefer to avoid being considered illiterate. Ain\u2019t occurs occasionally in the informal speech of some educated users, especially in self-consciously [sic] or folksy or humorous contexts (Ain\u2019t it the truth! She ain\u2019t what she used to be!), but it is completely unacceptable in formal writing and speech.

childhood\u2014by people who loved us and wished us well. We are reluctant to criticize those guesses. It is an ultimate act of rudeness to find fault with anything which is given to us in a spirit of love. So a modern, secular education is often painful. By its very nature, it invites us to question the wisdom of the ones we love.\n\u201cToo bad.\n\u201cI have said that one guess is as good as another, but that is only roughly so. Some guesses are crueler than others\u2014which is to say, harder on human beings, and on other animals as well. The belief that God wants heretics burned to death is a case in point. Some guesses are more suicidal than others. The belief that a true lover of God is immune to the bites of copperheads and rattlesnakes is a case in point. Some guesses are greedier and more egocentric than others. Belief in the divine right of kings and presidents is a case in point.\n\u201cThose are all discredited guesses. But it is reasonable to suppose that other bad guesses are poisoning our lives today. A good education in skepticism can help us to discover those bad guesses, and to destroy them with mockery and contempt. Most of them were made by honest, decent people who had no way of knowing what we know, or what we can find out, if we want to. We have one hell of a lot of good information about our bodies, about our planet, and the universe\u2014about our past. We don\u2019t have to guess as much as the old folks did.\n\u201cBertrand Russell declared that, in case he met God, he would say to Him, \u2019Sir, you did not give us enough information.\u2019 I would add to that, \u2019All the same, Sir, I\u2019m not persuaded that we did the best we could with the information we had. Toward the end there, anyway, we had tons of information.\u2019\n\u201cOur most dismaying failure is in the use of our knowledge of what human beings need in the way of bodily and spiritual nourishment. And I suspect that some of the guesses made by our ancestors are partly responsible for the starved bodies and spirits we see everywhere.\n\u201cShame on us. Less shame on our ancestors.\n\u201cI myself am an ancestor, having reproduced, having written books, being fifty-one years old. I come from simpler times. When I was a boy, all a commencement speaker had to say was, \u2019Go out and kill Hitler, boy. And then get married and have a lot of kids.\u2019\n\u201cSome of you might still go looking for Hitler, in Paraguay, say. He might be there. He would be eighty-five years old now. He has probably shaved off his mustache.\n\u201cSome of you might go out and kill Communists, but that is no longer a fashionable thing to do. And you wouldn\u2019t be killing real Communists anyway. This country has fulfilled more of the requirements of the Communist Manifesto than any avowedly Communist nation ever did.

When they were little they had eaten chips or breathed dust from old lead-based paint. Lead poisoning had made them very stupid. They were all in prison for the dumbest crimes imaginable, and I was never able to teach any of them to read and write.\nThanks to them, do we now have germs which eat lead?\nI know we have germs which eat petroleum. What their story is, I do not know. Maybe they\u2019re that Honduran gonorrhea.\n28\nJERRY PECK WAS in a wheelchair with a tank of oxygen in his lap at the grand opening of the Mohiga Ice Cream Emporium. But he and Muriel had a nice little hit on their hands. Tarkingtonians and Townies alike were pleased by the decor and the luscious ice cream.\nAfter the place had been open for only 6 months, though, a man came in and photographed everything. Then he pulled out a tape and made measurements which he wrote down in a book. The Pecks were flattered, and asked him if he was from an architectural magazine or what. He said that he worked for the architect who was designing the new student recreation center up on the hill, the Pahlavi Pavilion. The Pahlavis wanted it to have an ice cream parlor identical to theirs, right down to the last detail.\nSo maybe it wasn\u2019t paint remover that killed Jerry Peck after all.\nTHE PAVILION ALSO put the valley\u2019s only bowling alley out of business. It couldn\u2019t survive on the business of Townies alone. So anybody in this area who wanted to bowl and wasn\u2019t connected to Tarkington had to go 30 kilometers to the north, to the alleys next to the Meadowdale Cinema Complex, across the highway from the National Guard Armory.\nIT WAS A slow time of day at the Black Cat Caf\u00e9. There may have been a few prostitutes in vans in the parking lot out back but none inside.\nThe owner, Lyle Hooper, who was also Chief of the Volunteer Fire Department and a Notary, was at the other end of the bar, doing some kind of bookkeeping.

When Father met him, this man from Cincinnati was wearing wooden shoes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cCrucifixion in Rome\u201d is signed \u201cJohn Rettig,\u201d and it is dated 1888. So it was painted four years before Father was born. Father must have bought it in 1913 or so. Felix thinks there is a possibility that Hitler was with Father on that skylarking trip to Holland. Maybe so.\n\u201cCrucifixion in Rome\u201d is indeed set in Rome, which I have never seen. I know enough, though, to recognize that it is chock-a-block with architectural anachronisms. The Colosseum, for example, is in perfect repair, but there is also the spire of a Christian church, and some architectural details and monuments which appear to be more recent, even, than the Renaissance, maybe even nineteenth century. There are sixty-eight tiny but distinct human figures taking part in some sort of celebration amid all this architecture and sculpture. Felix and I counted them one time, when we were young. Hundreds more are implied by impressionistic smears and dots. Banners fly. Walls are festooned with ropes of leaves. What fun.\nOnly if you look closely at the painting will you realize that two of the sixty-eight figures are not having such a good time. They are in the lower left-hand corner, and are harmonious with the rest of the composition, but they have in fact just been hung from crosses.\nThe picture is a comment, I suppose, but certainly a bland one, on man\u2019s festive inhumanity to men\u2014even into what to John Rettig were modern times.\nIt has the same general theme, I guess, of Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica,\u201d which I have seen.
