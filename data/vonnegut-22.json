The Gazette had gotten the picture from my new employer, the News Bureau of General Electric. The Gazette sent the request to my new employer, and my new boss handed it to me.\n\u201cI supposed mistakenly that Uncle Alex knew of my situation, and would recognize the infamous name Guy Fawkes as a pseudonym, and would understand that the letter was a delightful family joke. He in fact blew his stack, took the letter to a lawyer, asking what legal steps he might take to regain his self-respect, and promised to write a letter to the President of GE, telling him he had an employee who did not know the value of a dollar. Before he could take such steps, somebody else told him who Guy Fawkes was, and where I was, and that I was surely the author.\u201d\nGENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY\nGENERAL OFFICE SCHENECTADY, N.

My bomb is going to work just great. And how are you doing with that kid with chicken pox?\u201d\nAndrei Sakharov was a sort of saint in 1975, a sort that is no longer celebrated, now that the Cold War is over. He was a dissident in the Soviet Union. He called for an end to the development and testing of nuclear weapons, and also for more freedoms for his people. He was kicked out of the USSR\u2019s Academy of Sciences. He was exiled from Moscow to a whistlestop on the permafrost.\nHe was not allowed to go to Oslo to receive his Peace Prize. His pediatrician wife, Elena Bonner, accepted it for him there. But isn\u2019t it time for us to ask now if she, or any pediatrician or healer, wasn\u2019t more deserving of a Peace Prize than anyone who had a hand in creating an H-bomb for any kind of government anywhere?\nHuman rights? What could be more indifferent to the rights of any form of life than an H-bomb?\nSakharov was in June of 1987 awarded an honorary doctorate by Staten Island College in New York City. Once again his government wouldn\u2019t let him accept in person. So I was asked to do that for him.\nAll I had to do was deliver a message he had sent. This was it: \u201cDon\u2019t give up on nuclear energy.\u201d I spoke it like a robot.\nI was so polite! But this was one year after this crazy planet\u2019s most deadly nuclear calamity so far, at Chernobyl, Ukraine. Children all over northern Europe will be sickened or worse for years to come by that release of radiation.

It was a play in itself, the way Harry did it, and Tennessee Williams hadn\u2019t written it all either. Tennessee Williams didn\u2019t write the part, for instance, where Harry, who weighs about one hundred forty-five, who\u2019s about five feet eight inches tall, added fifty pounds to his weight and four inches to his height by just picking up a playbook. He had a short little double-breasted bellows-back grade-school graduation suit coat on and a dinky little red tie with a horsehead on it. He took off the coat and tie, opened his collar, then turned his back to Doris and me, getting up steam for the part. There was a great big rip in the back of his shirt, and it looked like a fairly new shirt too. He\u2019d ripped it on purpose, so he could be that much more like Marlon Brando, right from the first.\nWhen he faced us again, he was huge and handsome and conceited and cruel. Doris read the part of Stella, the wife, and Harry bullied that old, old lady into believing that she was a sweet, pregnant girl married to a sexy gorilla who was going to beat her brains out. She had me believing it too. And I read the lines of Blanche, her sister in the play, and darned if Harry didn\u2019t scare me into feeling like a drunk and faded Southern belle.\nAnd then, while Doris and I were getting over our emotional experiences, like people coming out from under ether, Harry put down the playbook, put on his coat and tie, and turned into the pale hardware-store clerk again.\n\"Was\u2014was that all right?\" he said, and he seemed pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t get the part.\n\"Well,\" I said, \"for a first reading, that wasn\u2019t too bad.\"\n\"Is there a chance I\u2019ll get the part?\" he said. I don\u2019t know why he always had to pretend there was some doubt about his getting a part, but he did.\n\"I think we can safely say we\u2019re leaning powerfully in your direction,\" I told him.\nHe was very pleased. \"Thanks!

He could certainly lecture on history or race or biology or art or politics for hours, although he had read very little.\nAlmost all his opinions and information were cannibalized from the educations and miseducations of his roistering companions in Vienna before the First World War.\nAnd one of these pals was Hitler, of course.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe wedding and the reception took place in the Wetzel mansion, next door to the studio. The Wetzels and the Waltzes were proudly agnostic, so the ceremony was performed by a judge. Father\u2019s best man was John Fortune, the war hero and dairy farmer. Mother\u2019s attendants were friends from Oberlin.\nFather\u2019s immediate relatives, the uncles and cousins who earned his living for him, came with their mates to the wedding, but they stayed for only a few minutes of the reception, behaving correctly but coldly, and then they departed en masse. Father had given them every reason to loathe him.\nFather laughed. According to Mother, he announced to the rest of the guests that he was sorry, but that his relatives had to go back to the countinghouse.\nHe was quite the bohemian!", 0.12760551948051946], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "god-bless-you-dr-kevorkian": {"tfidf": [["carla", 0.08926291884990362], ["faye", 0.08926291884990362], ["ta", 0.04516872946814744], ["jack", 0.03595031202647037], ["execution", 0.03513629256796626], ["waiting", 0.03513629256796626], ["murderer", 0.03513629256796626], ["hell", 0.03387654710111058], ["texas", 0.02696273401985278], ["gurney", 0.02258436473407372], ["fifty", 0.022315729712475904], ["3", 0.022315729712475904], ["halt", 0.022315729712475904], ["caught", 0.022315729712475904], ["tucker", 0.022315729712475904], ["lunch", 0.022315729712475904], ["brought", 0.022315729712475904], ["february", 0.022315729712475904], ["upper", 0.022315729712475904], ["serbia", 0.022315729712475904], ["sign", 0.022315729712475904], ["vacate", 0.022315729712475904], ["unstuck", 0.022315729712475904], ["hastened", 0.022315729712475904], ["clarity", 0.022315729712475904], ["filler", 0.022315729712475904], ["strangers", 0.022315729712475904], ["voice", 0.022315729712475904], ["difficulties", 0.022315729712475904], ["reply", 0.022315729712475904], ["trout", 0.022315729712475904], ["hours", 0.022315729712475904], ["busy", 0.022315729712475904], ["supervises", 0.022315729712475904], ["conviction", 0.022315729712475904], ["murdered", 0.022315729712475904], ["assure", 0.022315729712475904], ["pick", 0.022315729712475904], ["kilgore", 0.022315729712475904], ["appeals", 0.022315729712475904], ["feet", 0.022315729712475904], ["total", 0.022315729712475904], ["indispensable", 0.022315729712475904], ["glad", 0.022315729712475904], ["governor", 0.022315729712475904], ["quarters", 0.022315729712475904], ["happened", 0.022315729712475904], ["heels", 0.022315729712475904], ["dragging", 0.022315729712475904], ["provide", 0.022315729712475904], ["repeat", 0.022315729712475904], ["shortly", 0.022315729712475904], ["axe", 0.022315729712475904], ["kevorkian", 0.021798738918190324], ["kosovo", 0.01756814628398313], ["saved", 0.01756814628398313], ["plate", 0.01756814628398313], ["michigan", 0.01756814628398313], ["celebrity", 0.01756814628398313], ["chamber", 0.01756814628398313], ["bad", 0.01756814628398313], ["recorded", 0.01756814628398313], ["legal", 0.01756814628398313], ["yards", 0.01756814628398313], ["afternoon", 0.01756814628398313], ["murder", 0.01756814628398313], ["company", 0.01756814628398313], ["temporary", 0.01756814628398313], ["prepared", 0.01756814628398313], ["money", 0.014790988009269672], ["tape", 0.014790988009269672], ["killed", 0.014790988009269672], ["science", 0.014790988009269672], ["born", 0.014790988009269672], ["state", 0.014790988009269672], ["completely", 0.014790988009269672], ["career", 0.014790988009269672], ["sake", 0.014790988009269672], ["speaking", 0.014790988009269672], ["1998", 0.014790988009269672], ["order", 0.014790988009269672], ["tunnel", 0.013089197877088166], ["paradise", 0.012820562855490351], ["three", 0.012820562855490351], ["alive", 0.012820562855490351], ["experiences", 0.012820562855490351], ["time", 0.01130232199149189], ["unstrapped", 0.01129218236703686], ["felt", 0.01129218236703686], ["fiction", 0.01129218236703686], ["hope", 0.01129218236703686], ["quote", 0.01129218236703686], ["gates", 0.010043404580776896], ["pearly", 0.010043404580776896], ["trip", 0.010043404580776896], ["person", 0.010043404580776896], ["death", 0.0099761879955144], ["asked", 0.009495166856985551], ["lethal", 0.008987578006617593], ["writer", 0.008987578006617593], ["reporter", 0.008987578006617593], ["facility", 0.008987578006617593], ["huntsville", 0.008987578006617593], ["interviewed", 0.008987578006617593], ["injection", 0.008987578006617593], ["afterlife", 0.007266246306063442], ["signing", 0.006544598938544083], ["blue", 0.006544598938544083], ["life", 0.006544598938544083], ["controlled", 0.006544598938544083], ["late", 0.005891789487829531], ["dr", 0.005891789487829531], ["wnyc", 0.005295821152284121], ["experience", 0.005295821152284121], ["times", 0.004747583428492776], ["dead", 0.0037674406638306297], ["kurt", 0.0037674406638306297], ["vonnegut", 0.002910158862775794]], "sentiment": ["This is Kurt Vonnegut, in the indispensable company of Jack Kevorkian, who has saved my life a hundred times now, signing off until the next time. Ta ta.\nit is late in the afternoon\nof February 3, 1998. I have just been unstrapped from a gurney following another controlled near-death experience in this busy execution chamber in Huntsville, Texas.\nFor the first time in my career, I was actually on the heels of a celebrity as I made my way down the blue tunnel to Paradise. She was Carla Faye Tucker, the born-again murderer of two strangers with a pick-axe. Carla Faye was completely killed here, by the State of Texas, shortly after lunch time.\nTwo hours later, on another gurney, I myself was made only three-quarters dead. I caught up with Carla Faye in the tunnel, about a hundred fifty yards from the far end, near the Pearly Gates. Since she was dragging her feet, I hastened to assure her that there was no Hell waiting for her, no Hell waiting for anyone. She said that was too bad because she would be glad to go to Hell if only she could take the governor of Texas with her. \u201cHe\u2019s a murderer, too,\u201d said Carla Faye. \u201cHe murdered me.\u201d\nDr. Jack Kevorkian supervises my trip to near death and back. Your reporter from the Afterlife has to sign off now. Jack and I have been asked to vacate the lethal injection facility, which must be prepared for yet another total execution. Speaking for both of us, I now say, ta-ta.\nunfortunately, the recent\nlegal difficulties of Jack Kevorkian in Michigan, which is to say his conviction for murder one, have brought what I hope is a temporary halt to the near-death experiences he has been giving me. In order to provide some filler between WNYC\u2019s appeals for money, I have interviewed a person who is still alive.\nHe is science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout. I asked him how he felt about what happened in Kosovo, Serbia. I tape-recorded his reply, but his upper plate came unstuck again and again.

the General. \u201cSeems like he does something like this every time the temperature gets above ninety. Remember the time he had the manure-spreader out until midnight? That was a hot day.\u201d The General snickered. \u201cBoy, the farm help you get these days. The darnedest thing happened this morning. I went over to the hog barn to watch Banghart feed the pigs. For no reason at all, he got sore as the devil when he saw me. He threw down the bucket, and can you imagine what he said?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. What did he say?\u201d said Annie. Haley noted with distaste that her conversations consisted mainly of questions of this sort, and of echoes.\n\u201cHe told me that I was going to cross him up once too often and get mine along with the rest of them. Can you imagine?\u201d The General was laughing.\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019d better get rid of him,\u201d Haley blurted.\nThe General looked at him with surprise. \u201cI\u2019d sooner get rid of the tractor. He\u2019s nothing to worry about. I\u2019ve got him right under this.\u201d The General held up a broad, flat thumb and winked. \u201cWell, where was I? Oh, yes. \u2018Send me up some 240s,\u2019 I said, and . . .\u201d\nHaley\u2019s thoughts strayed again, taking him back to the events of lunchtime, when Roy Flemming, Kitty\u2019s current love, had appeared in the kitchen, having walked into the house without knocking. Haley had never seen anything quite like Roy before. His red hair, his freckled moon-face and childish blue eyes were familiar enough, but his bearing and thin mustache seemed as out of keeping with these as an olive in the bottom of a milkshake. Haley wondered just what Roy imagined himself to represent. His swagger and attire\u2014gleaming riding boots, enormously wide belt spangled with bits of colored glass, crushed and twisted Army officer\u2019s hat, and polo shirt decorated with palm trees\u2014might be proper, Haley decided, for the leader of a bandit band in a musical comedy.\nThe General had spoken to Roy without looking up from his food. \u201cGet out,\u201d he had said. Kitty had told Roy to sit down, that her father was joking. The General had thereupon offered to fill his \u201csmart young behind with bird-shot\u201d if he showed up again.\nRoy had started to back out of the room, embarrassed, and bereft of all save the glittering trappings of his devil-may-care role. Kitty had dragged him back into the kitchen. \u201cTell him what you came for,\u201d Kitty had said.

He retreated again into the hedge, and Hope ran upstairs with the message, leaving Haley alone on the kitchen steps. The light in Kitty\u2019s room flashed on again, and Haley turned his head to see her standing in the window, waving her hands and nodding.

which the paper published. It described the creatures from Tralfamadore.\nThe letter said that they were two feet high, and green, and shaped like plumber\u2019s friends. Their suction cups were on the ground, and their shafts, which were extremely flexible, usually pointed to the sky. At the top of each shaft was a little hand with a green eye in its palm. The creatures were friendly, and they could see in four dimensions. They pitied Earthlings for being able to see only three. They had many wonderful things to teach Earthlings, especially about time. Billy promised to tell what some of those wonderful things were in his next letter.\nBilly was working on his second letter when the first letter was published. The second letter started out like this:\n\u201cThe most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.\n\u201cWhen a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is \u2018So it goes.\u2019\u201d\nAnd so on.\nBilly was working on this letter in the basement rumpus room of his empty house. It was his housekeeper\u2019s day off. There was an old typewriter in the rumpus room. It was a beast. It weighed as much as a storage battery. Billy couldn\u2019t carry it very far very easily, which was why he was writing in the rumpus room instead of somewhere else.\nThe oil burner had quit. A mouse had eaten through the insulation of a wire leading to the thermostat. The temperature in the house was down to fifty degrees, but Billy hadn\u2019t noticed. He wasn\u2019t warmly dressed, either. He was barefoot, and still in his pajamas and a bathrobe, though it was late afternoon. His bare feet were blue and ivory.\nThe cockles of Billy\u2019s heart, at any rate, were glowing coals. What made them so hot was Billy\u2019s belief that he was going to comfort so many people with the truth about time. His door chimes upstairs had been ringing and ringing. It was his daughter Barbara up there, wanting in. Now she let herself in with a key, crossed the floor over his head, calling, \u201cFather? Daddy, where are you?\u201d And so on.\nBilly didn\u2019t answer her, so she was nearly hysterical, expecting to find his corpse. And then she looked into the very last place there was to look\u2014which was the rumpus room.", 0.060934829059829054], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["crusaders", 0.16604339233714743], ["neighbor", 0.1653059078152103], ["denton", 0.15729266483462942], ["bobby", 0.15729266483462942], ["check", 0.14491922603403545], ["thy", 0.12453254425286057], ["kingdom", 0.11020393854347352], ["rules", 0.11020393854347352], ["valve", 0.08866252111860863], ["love", 0.08835706022473239], ["god", 0.0837440127592649], ["trip", 0.08302169616857372], ["cried", 0.07870476136913852], ["heaven", 0.07864633241731471], ["eleven", 0.06712110369374373], ["manservant", 0.05510196927173676], ["adultery", 0.05510196927173676], ["einstein", 0.05510196927173676], ["checks", 0.05510196927173676], ["chemist", 0.05510196927173676], ["tomorrow", 0.05510196927173676], ["ox", 0.05510196927173676], ["albert", 0.05510196927173676], ["physicist", 0.05510196927173676], ["covet", 0.05510196927173676], ["maidservant", 0.05510196927173676], ["understand", 0.051464090042414874], ["ass", 0.048306408678011815], ["witness", 0.048306408678011815], ["commit", 0.048306408678011815], ["tank", 0.048306408678011815], ["wire", 0.044331260559304315], ["poisonous", 0.044331260559304315], ["countdown", 0.044331260559304315], ["separate", 0.044331260559304315], ["bear", 0.044331260559304315], ["list", 0.044331260559304315], ["steal", 0.044331260559304315], ["ten", 0.043513793804999895], ["tight", 0.037535699965579365], ["wrote", 0.037535699965579365], ["ship", 0.0364227715012726], ["space", 0.03607531372253858], ["stones", 0.03602441879080232], ["whale", 0.03602441879080232], ["round", 0.03602441879080232], ["ready", 0.0347152874905619], ["shouted", 0.0347152874905619], ["false", 0.033560551846871865], ["wonderful", 0.031593192087439013], ["things", 0.030928423487894114], ["hear", 0.029228858197077365], ["full", 0.0285524574962249], ["house", 0.02732536785942092], ["fire", 0.026764991253146915], ["closed", 0.025253710078369872], ["green", 0.025253710078369872], ["dead", 0.024361829899882358], ["lot", 0.02315984634995753], ["open", 0.022789843134439422], ["big", 0.01970081326542084], ["told", 0.018936484427482487], ["great", 0.01674880255185298], ["mars", 0.012389137637525081]], "sentiment": ["\"God told us what we had to do on this wonderful space ship.

some fun\u2014although they had always had a lot of fun on weekends and during vacations, and at work, as far as that went. But a miasma overlay this unexpected escapade. And Roy himself, during their early supper, seemed puzzled by the afternoon. So that was that. He didn\u2019t think he would do it again, and they could forget the incident, except maybe to laugh about it now and then.\nBut then, right before bedtime, while they were staring at the glowing embers in the fieldstone fireplace which Roy had built with his own two horny hands, Roy said, \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s more of what?\u201d said Mary.\n\u201cAbout this afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the places I went was the travel agency.\u201d There was only one such establishment in Ilium, and not doing well.\n\u201cSo?\u201d she said.\n\u201cI signed us up for something,\u201d he said. It was as though he were remembering a dream. \u201cIt\u2019s all paid for. It\u2019s all taken care of. It\u2019s done. In November, you and I are flying to Ecuador, and we are going to take \u2018the Nature Cruise of the Century.\u2019\u201d\nRoy and Mary Hepburn were the very first persons to respond to the advertising and publicity program for the maiden voyage of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, which ship was nothing but a keel and a pile of blueprints in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, at the time. The Ilium travel agent had just received a poster announcing the cruise. He was just Scotch-taping it to his wall when Roy Hepburn walked in.\nIf I may interject a personal note: I myself had been working as a welder in Malm\u00f6 for about a year, but the Bah\u00eda de Darwin had not yet materialized sufficiently so as to require my services. I would literally lose my head to that steel maiden only when springtime came. Question: Who hasn\u2019t lost his or her head in the springtime?\nBut to continue:\nThe travel poster in Ilium depicted a very strange bird standing on the edge of a volcanic island, looking out at a beautiful white motor ship churning by. This bird was black and appeared to be the size of a large duck, but it had a neck as long and supple as a snake. The queerest thing about it, though, was that it seemed to have no wings, which was almost the truth. This sort of bird was endemic to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, meaning that it was found there and nowhere else on the planet. Its wings were tiny and folded flat against its body, in order that it might swim as fast and deep as a fish could. This was a much better way to catch fish than, as so many fish-eating birds were required to do, to wait for fish to come to the surface and then crash down on them with beaks agape. This very successful bird was called by human beings a \u201cflightless cormorant.\u201d It could go where the fish were.

Just listen to this and then tell me who was toying with whom at that supper, which is now two weeks ago: Mrs. Berman is not an amateur writing a biography of her late husband. That was just a story to cover her true identity and purpose for being here. She swore me to secrecy, and then confessed that she was really in the Hamptons to research and write a novel about working-class adolescents living in a resort community teeming in the summer time with the sons and daughters of multimillionaires.\nAnd this wasn\u2019t going to be her first novel either. It would be the twenty-first in a series of shockingly frank and enormously popular novels for young readers, several of which had been made into motion pictures.

\u201cK,\u201d which was my nickname when a child. People who knew me before I was twelve years old still call me that. So do my descendants.\nI have never identified with the \u201cK\u201d in Kafka\u2019s works, by the way. Having grown up in a democracy, I have dared to imagine that I know at all times who is really in charge, what is really going on. This could be a mistake.\nThe opening pages of Uncle John\u2019s manuscript give an impersonal account, such as might be found in an encyclopedia, of the settling of this country by European immigrants, and the consequent growth of commerce, industry, agriculture, and so on. The largest of the waves was German\u2014the second was Italian, the third was Irish.\nUncle John\u2019s conclusion to this prologue is worth setting down here: \u201cThe two world wars in which the United States was arrayed against Germany were painful experiences for German-Americans. They hated to be obliged to fight their racial cousins, but they did so, and it is significant that of the millions of German descendants in the United States during those dreadful wars there was not one case of treason.\n\u201cThe Germans, while loving the country of their origin, did not approve of Kaiser Wilhelm II and his warlords, nor Hitler and his wretched Nazis. Their sympathies were with England, and their adoption of the culture of England determined their attitude. When England was in trouble in 1917 and again in 1941, the German-Americans rallied to her support against the Fatherland. This is a phenomenon little remarked upon.\u201d\nSo be it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAs I have said in other books, the anti-Germanism in this country during the First World War so shamed and dismayed my parents that they resolved to raise me without acquainting me with the language or the literature or the music or the oral family histories which my ancestors had loved. They volunteered to make me ignorant and rootless as proof of their patriotism.\nThis was done with surprising meekness by many, many German-American families in Indianapolis, it seems to me. Uncle John almost seems to boast of this dismantling and quiet burial of a culture, a culture which surely would have been of use to me today.\nBut I still get a frisson when I encounter a German-American who was raised, amazingly, to loath Woodrow Wilson for calling into question the loyalty of what he called \u201chyphenated Americans,\u201d for egging on those who loved democracy so much that they defaced the walls of German social and gymnastic and educational associations across the country, and refused to listen to German music or, even, to eat sauerkraut.

I was the footloose bachelor who didn\u2019t have much of a future in research anyway. George was the married man who was to stay home with his laboratory and his wife, and go on to bigger things.\u201d\nLife\u2019s surprises made Hoenikker sniffle. \u201cDesigning Jenny\u2014\u201d he said, \u201cthat was supposed to be a little joke in the middle of George\u2019s career\u2014an electronic joke off the top of his head. Jenny was a little something he was to tinker with while he came drifting back to earth after his honeymoon with Nancy.\u201d\nHoenikker rambled on about those olden days when Jenny was born. And sometimes he would make Jenny chime in, as though she remembered those days, too. Those were bad days for Hoenikker, because he fell in love with George\u2019s wife. He\u2019d been scared to death he would do something about it.\n\u201cI loved her for what she was,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it was all the pap George was spouting about love that made me fall in love with her. George would say something ridiculous about love or about her, and I\u2019d think up real reasons for loving her. I wound up loving her as a human being, as a miraculous, one-of-a-kind, moody muddle of faults and virtues\u2014part child, part woman, part goddess, and no more consistent than a putty slide-rule.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then George began spending more and more time with me,\u201d said Jenny. \u201cHe took to going home from the laboratory at the last possible moment, wolfing down his supper, and hurrying back to work on me till well past midnight. He would have the control shoes on all day long and half the night\u2014and we would talk, and talk, and talk.\u201d\nHoenikker tried to give her face some expression for what she was going to say next. He punched the Mona-Lisa-smile button Sully Harris had punched the day before. \u201cI was excellent company,\u201d she said. \u201cI never once said anything he didn\u2019t want to hear\u2014and I always said what he wanted to hear exactly when he wanted to hear it.\u201d\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Hoenikker, undoing Jenny\u2019s straps so she could step forward, \u201cis the most calculating woman, the greatest student of the na\u00efve male heart that ever walked the face of the earth. Nancy never had a chance.\u201d\n\u201cOrdinarily,\u201d said Hoenikker, \u201ca man\u2019s first wild dreams about his wife peter out after the honeymoon. The man then has to settle down to the difficult but rewarding business of finding out to whom he is really married. But George had an alternative. He could keep his wild dreams of a wife alive in Jenny.

allowed to feel! The models were persons with reputations for being normal. The therapist, after a deeply upsetting investigation of normality at this time and place, was bound to conclude that a normal person, functioning well on the upper levels of a prosperous, industrialized society, can hardly hear his conscience at all.\nSo a logical person might conclude that I have been guilty of balderdash in announcing a new disease, samaritrophia, when it is virtually as common among healthy Americans as noses, say. I defend myself in this manner: samaritrophia is only a disease, and a violent one, too, when it attacks those exceedingly rare individuals who reach biological maturity still loving and wanting to help their fellow men.\nI have treated only one case. I have never heard of anyone's treating another. In looking about myself, I can see only one other person who has the potential for a samaritrophic collapse. That person, of course, is Mr. Z. And so deep is his commitment to compassion, that, were he to come down with samaritrophia, I sense that he would kill himself, or perhaps kill a hundred others and then be shot down like a mad dog, before we could treat him.\nTreat, treat, treat.\nSome treat!\nMrs. Z, having been treated and cured in our health emporium, expressed a wish to, \"... go out and have some fun for a change, to live it up ...\" before her looks were gone. Her looks were still staggeringly attractive, were marked by lines of affection unlimited, which she no longer deserved.\nShe wanted nothing more to do with Hometown or Mr. Z, announced that she was off to the gaiety of Paris, and to merry old friends there. She wished to buy new clothes, she said, and to dance and dance and dance until she fainted in the arms of a tall, dark stranger, into the arms, hopefully, of a double spy.\nShe often referred to her husband as, \"My dirty, drunk uncle down South,\" although never to his face. She was not a schizophrenic, but, whenever her husband visited her, which he did three times a week, she manifested all of the sick cutenesses of paranoia. Shades of Clara Bow! She would pluck his cheek, coax kisses from him, kisses she gigglingly declined to receive. She told him she wanted to go to Paris for just a little while, to see her dear family, and that she would be back before he knew it. She wanted him to say farewell and give her love to all her dear, underprivileged friends in Hometown.\nMr. Z was not deceived. He saw her off to Paris at the Indianapolis Airport, and he told me when the plane was a speck in the sky that he would never see her again. \"She certainly looked happy,\" he said to me. \"She certainly will have a good time when she gets back there with the kind of company she deserves.\"", 0.04931323109514599], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf":

Alexander, for the best view of all.\nSo the windows were opened and the sharpshooters laid their rifles in their cradles of different kinds.\nWho were the four sharpshooters, really\u2014and was there really such a trade? There was less work for sharpshooters than there was for hangmen at the time. Not one of the four had ever been hired in this capacity before, nor was he likely, unless war came, to be paid for such work ever again. One was a part-time Pinkerton agent, and the other three were his friends. The four of them hunted together regularly, and had for years praised one another for what unbelievably good shots they were. So when the Pinkerton Agency let it be known that it could use four sharpshooters, they materialized almost instantly, like the company of citizen soldiers.\nThe man with the tripod had invented the device for the occasion. Nor had the man with the sandbag ever couched his rifle on a sandbag before. So it was, too, with the chairs and tables and the tidy displays of ammunition and all that: They had agreed among themselves as to how truly professional sharpshooters should comport themselves.\nYears later Alexander McCone, when asked by Starbuck what he thought the principal cause of the Cuyahoga Massacre had been, would reply: \u201cAmerican am-am-am-amateurism in the muh-muh-matters of luh-life and duh-duh-duh-death.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen the windows were opened, the oceanic murmurs of the crowd came in with the cold air. The crowd wished to be silent, and imagined itself to be silent\u2014but this person had to whisper a little something, and that one had to reply, and so on. Hence, sounds like a sea.\nIt was mainly this seeming surf that Alexander heard as he stood with his father and brother in the belfry. The defenders of the factory were quiet. Except for the rattles and bumps of the opening of the windows on the second floor, they had made no reply.\nAlexander\u2019s father said this as they waited: \u201cIt is no dainty thing to shape iron and steel to human needs, my boys. No man in his right mind would do such work, if it were not for fear of cold and hunger. The question is, my boys\u2014how much does the world need iron and steel products?

It was now being offered for a dollar, and people who paid even that much did so not because of the pictures. They paid for the words.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe words in the book, incidentally, were about life on a dying planet named Lingo-Three, whose inhabitants resembled American automobiles. They had wheels. They were powered by internal combustion engines. They ate fossil fuels. They weren\u2019t manufactured, though. They reproduced. They laid eggs containing baby automobiles, and the babies matured in pools of oil drained from adult crankcases.\nLingo-Three was visited by space travelers, who learned that the creatures were becoming extinct for this reason: they had destroyed their planet\u2019s resources, including its atmosphere.\nThe space travelers weren\u2019t able to offer much in the way of material assistance. The automobile creatures hoped to borrow some oxygen, and to have the visitors carry at least one of their eggs to another planet, where it might hatch, where an automobile civilization could begin again. But the smallest egg they had was a forty-eight pounder, and the space travelers themselves were only an inch high, and their space ship wasn\u2019t even as big as an Earthling shoebox. They were from Zeltoldimar.\nThe spokesman for the Zeltoldimarians was Kago. Kago said that all he could do was to tell others in the Universe about how wonderful the automobile creatures had been. Here is what he said to all those rusting junkers who were out of gas: \u201cYou will be gone, but not forgotten.\u201d\nThe illustration for the story at this point showed two Chinese girls, seemingly identical twins, seated on a couch with their legs wide open.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo Kago and his brave little Zeltoldimarian crew, which was all homosexual, roamed the Universe, keeping the memory of the automobile creatures alive. They came at last to the planet Earth. In all innocence, Kago told the Earthlings about the automobiles. Kago did not know that human beings could be as easily felled by a single idea as by cholera or the bubonic plague. There was no immunity to cuckoo ideas on Earth.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.16093864468864474], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["twerp", 0.10674243624249904], ["school", 0.07542336203011485], ["mark", 0.07542336203011485], ["seats", 0.07116162416166602], ["buttons", 0.07116162416166602], ["taxicabs", 0.07116162416166602], ["book", 0.0691405013230922], ["eden", 0.06440387235986329], ["harvard", 0.059609171152333607], ["medical", 0.059609171152333607], ["express", 0.05589011196376345], ["hitler", 0.04609366754872813], ["padded", 0.041357038585499224], ["bush", 0.041357038585499224], ["painter", 0.041357038585499224], ["dysfunctional", 0.041357038585499224], ["resolve", 0.041357038585499224], ["borrows", 0.041357038585499224], ["hasten", 0.041357038585499224], ["lends", 0.041357038585499224], ["cell", 0.041357038585499224], ["humorist", 0.041357038585499224], ["keeper", 0.041357038585499224], ["maniac", 0.041357038585499224], ["heck", 0.041357038585499224], ["krasner", 0.041357038585499224], ["undergraduate", 0.041357038585499224], ["impressionable", 0.041357038585499224], ["recovered", 0.041357038585499224], ["clue", 0.041357038585499224], ["buying", 0.041357038585499224], ["boston", 0.041357038585499224], ["straitjacket", 0.041357038585499224], ["saxophonist", 0.041357038585499224], ["vonnegut", 0.04129896634119845], ["pointing", 0.03558081208083301], ["borrow", 0.03558081208083301], ["team", 0.03558081208083301], ["wrestling", 0.03558081208083301], ["behave", 0.03558081208083301], ["pediatrician", 0.03558081208083301], ["apocalypse", 0.03558081208083301], ["area", 0.03558081208083301], ["buy", 0.03558081208083301], ["unusually", 0.03558081208083301], ["defined", 0.03558081208083301], ["graduate", 0.03558081208083301], ["shortridge", 0.03558081208083301], ["student", 0.03558081208083301], ["serious", 0.03558081208083301], ["help", 0.0327852059450986], ["consider", 0.032201936179931646], ["mentioned", 0.032201936179931646], ["elected", 0.032201936179931646], ["loose", 0.032201936179931646], ["dad", 0.032201936179931646], ["false", 0.032201936179931646], ["tells", 0.032201936179931646], ["chinese", 0.029804585576166803], ["college", 0.029804585576166803], ["ends", 0.029804585576166803], ["writer", 0.027945055981881725], ["crack", 0.027945055981881725], ["difference", 0.027945055981881725], ["rear", 0.027945055981881725], ["jokes", 0.027945055981881725], ["mental", 0.027945055981881725], ["change", 0.027945055981881725], ["longer", 0.027945055981881725], ["dog", 0.027945055981881725], ["paul", 0.026425709675265436], ["sake", 0.026425709675265436], ["ago", 0.026425709675265436], ["stuff", 0.02514112067670495], ["wrote", 0.024028359071500593], ["shot", 0.023046833774364065], ["women", 0.023046833774364065], ["tonight", 0.023046833774364065], ["teeth", 0.023046833774364065], ["tomorrow", 0.02216882947721551], ["son", 0.02216882947721551], ["person", 0.02216882947721551], ["bit", 0.020649483170599225], ["guy", 0.020649483170599225], ["family", 0.020649483170599225], ["called", 0.01998246060665309], ["bad", 0.019364894172038738], ["young", 0.018252132566834386], ["high", 0.017270607269697855], ["george", 0.016820047092445556], ["set", 0.0163926029725493], ["times", 0.0163926029725493], ["lot", 0.0163926029725493], ["kind", 0.015986018271137367], ["life", 0.014873256665933013], ["asked", 0.014873256665933013], ["real", 0.013891731368796486], ["years", 0.01329624000227861], ["god", 0.013013727071647933], ["big", 0.012219475573278557], ["thing", 0.01061637646788309], ["good", 0.007812441162706316]], "sentiment": ["I have the humorist Paul Krasner to thank for pointing out a big difference between George W.

He wrote one heck of a good book called The Eden Express. It is about his mental crack-up, padded-cell-and-straitjacket stuff. He had been on the wrestling team as an undergraduate in college.
