you see, Doctor Einstein,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can\u2019t blame God for everything, now can we?\u201d He handed Einstein his pass through the Pearly Gates. \u201cGood to have you aboard,\u201d he said.\nSo into heaven Einstein went, carrying his beloved fiddle. He thought no more about the audit. He was a veteran of countless border crossings by then. There had always been senseless questions to answer, empty promises to make, meaningless documents to sign.\nBut once inside heaven Einstein encountered ghost after ghost who was sick about what his or her audit had shown. One husband and wife team, which had committed suicide after losing everything in a chicken farm in New Hampshire, had been told that they had been living the whole time over the largest deposit of nickel in the world.\nA fourteen-year-old Harlem child who had been killed in a gang fight was told about a two-carat diamond ring that lay for weeks at the bottom of a catch basin he passed every day. It was flawless and had not been reported as stolen. If he had sold it for only a tenth of its value, four hundred dollars, say, according to his auditor, and speculated in commodities futures, especially in cocoa at that time, he could have moved his mother and sisters and himself into a Park Avenue condominium and sent himself to Andover and then to Harvard after that.\nThere was Harvard again.\nAll the auditing stories that Einstein heard were told by Americans. He had chosen to settle in the American part of heaven. Understandably, he had mixed feelings about Europeans, since he was a Jew. But it wasn\u2019t only Americans who were being audited. Pakistanis and pygmies from the Philippines and even communists had to go through the very same thing.\nIt was in character for Einstein to be offended first by the mathematics of the system the auditors wanted everybody to be so grateful for. He calculated that if every person on Earth took full advantage of every opportunity, became a millionaire and then a billionaire and so on, the paper wealth on that one little planet would exceed the worth of all the minerals in the universe in a matter of three months or so. Also: There would be nobody left to do any useful work.\nSo he sent God a note. It assumed that God had no idea what sorts of rubbish His auditors were talking. It accused the auditors rather than God of cruelly deceiving new arrivals about the opportunities they had had on Earth. He tried to guess the auditors\u2019 motives. He wondered if they might not be sadists.\nThe story ended abruptly. Einstein did not get to see God. But God sent out an archangel who was boiling mad. He told Einstein that if he continued to destroy ghosts\u2019 respect for the audits, he was going to take Einstein\u2019s fiddle away from him for all eternity. So Einstein never discussed the audits with anybody ever again. His fiddle meant more to him than anything.\nThe story was certainly a slam at God, suggesting that He was capable of using a cheap subterfuge like the audits to get out of being blamed for how hard economic life was down here.", 0.009941325014854415], "title": "Jailbird"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["weren", 0.11803197746791047], ["brazil", 0.09367334776195249], ["overtake", 0.09367334776195249], ["mercury", 0.08748895307210529], ["unk", 0.08377336240632421], ["boaz", 0.08345785735678612], ["emerged", 0.08212089475262008], ["safe", 0.08212089475262008], ["peculiar", 0.08212089475262008], ["explanation", 0.07536314295081734], ["crashed", 0.07536314295081734], ["amazon", 0.07536314295081734], ["survived", 0.07536314295081734], ["kissed", 0.06684938255471749], ["forest", 0.06381068994148492], ["expected", 0.06381068994148492], ["killed", 0.059015988733955235], ["fired", 0.05705293813968217], ["simple", 0.05705293813968217], ["rain", 0.05705293813968217], ["stay", 0.05705293813968217], ["automatic", 0.05705293813968217], ["carry", 0.05370842654864632], ["navigator", 0.05370842654864632], ["pressed", 0.052258236932152494], ["button", 0.04968905893503152], ["pilot", 0.04853917774358233], ["chrono", 0.04573018745559303], ["set", 0.04550048513034976], ["happened", 0.04550048513034976], ["supposed", 0.04550048513034976], ["planet", 0.04550048513034976], ["earth", 0.042123067967585276], ["wanted", 0.041415110829800005], ["ship", 0.04127914103477561], ["company", 0.04002541734748248], ["bee", 0.04002541734748248], ["rumfoord", 0.037643320763078386], ["war", 0.03698672473424991], ["piece", 0.03698672473424991], ["luck", 0.03349138255121543], ["place", 0.03261398699312506], ["years", 0.028142920549880403], ["thing", 0.025158783359063977], ["mars", 0.021061533983792638], ["good", 0.01943422615772737], ["space", 0.015332008332078897]], "sentiment": ["It crashed into the Amazon Rain Forest in Brazil.\nOnly Bee and Chrono survived.\nChrono emerged, kissed his good-luck piece.\nUnk and Boaz weren\u2019t fired upon either.\nA very peculiar thing happened to them after they pressed the on button and took off from Mars.

It is the epigraph of this book.\n\u201cYou believe that human beings are good animals, who will eventually solve all their problems and make earth into a Garden of Eden again.\u201d\n\u201cCould I see her, please?\u201d I said. I knew she was somewhere at the other end of the tunnel, that she was dead. That was the first thing I had asked Father after I myself was dead: \u201cDo you know what became of Mother?\u201d I had searched everywhere for her, before joining the United States Marines.\n\u201cIs that Mother right behind you?\u201d I said. The blue tunnel was in a restless state of peristalsis. Its squirms often afforded me glimpses deep into its interior. I saw this woman in there, that third time father appeared, and I thought it might be Mother\u2014but no such luck.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Naomi Tharp, Leon,\u201d the woman called out to me. She was the neighbor woman who, after my real mother left, did her best to be my mother for a little while. \u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. Tharp,\u201d she called. \u201cYou remember me, don\u2019t you, Leon? You come in here just like you used to come in through my kitchen door. Be a good boy now. You don\u2019t want to be left out there for another million years.\u201d\nI took another step toward the nozzle. The Bah\u00eda de Darwin became a fantasia of cobwebs. The blue tunnel became as substantial and sensible a means of transportation as the Malm\u00f6 streetcar which used to take me to and from the shipyard every day.\nBut then, behind me, from up in the Bah\u00eda de Darwin\u2019s gossamer crow\u2019s nest, I heard the dim spook which Mary had become shouting something over and over again. She was in agony of some sort, I thought. I could not make out her words, but her tone would have been appropriate if she had been shot in the stomach.\nI had to know what she was saying, and so I took two steps backwards, and then turned and looked up at her. She was sobbing, she was laughing. She was bent over the rim of the steel bucket, so that her head was upside down as she shouted to the Captain on the bridge: \u201cLand ho! Land ho! Praise God! Dear God! Land ho! Land ho!\u201d\n8\nIT WAS SANTA ROSALIA which Mary Hepburn saw.

That idea wouldn\u2019t catch on big in her native country until the last three years of the Vietnam War.\nAfter Dan Gregory\u2019s death, her regular escort in Rome was Mussolini\u2019s Oxford-educated and unmarried Minister of Culture, the handsome Bruno, Count Portomaggiore. He explained to Marilee at once that they could have no physical relationship, since he was interested sexually only in men and boys. Such a preference, if acted upon, was a capital offense at the time, but Count Bruno felt perfectly safe, no matter how outrageously he might behave. He was confident that Mussolini would protect him, since he was the only member of the old aristocracy who had accepted a high position in his government, and who virtually wallowed in admiration at the upstart dictator\u2019s booted feet.\n\u201cHe was a perfect ass,\u201d said Marilee. She said that people laughed at his cowardice and vanity and effeminacy.\n\u201cHe was also,\u201d she added, \u201cthe perfect head of British Intelligence in Italy.\u201d\nAfter Dan and Fred were killed, and before the United States got into the war, Marilee was the toast of Rome. She had a wonderful time shopping and dancing, dancing, dancing, with the count, who enjoyed hearing her talk, and was always the perfect gentleman. Her wish was his command, and he never threatened her physically, and never demanded that she do this or that until one night, when he told her that Mussolini himself had ordered him to marry her!\n\u201cHe had many enemies,\u201d said Marilee, \u201cand they had been telling Mussolini that he was a homosexual and a British spy. Mussolini certainly knew he loved men and boys, but didn\u2019t even suspect that a man that silly could have the nerve or wit to be a spy.\u201d\nWhen Mussolini ordered his Minister of Culture to prove that he wasn\u2019t a homosexual by wedding Marilee, he also handed him a document for Marilee to sign. It was designed to placate old aristocrats to whom the idea of an American floozy\u2019s inheriting ancient estates would have been intolerable. It set forth that, in the case of the count\u2019s death, Marilee would have his property for life, but without the right to sell it or leave it to anyone else. Upon her death, it was to go to the count\u2019s nearest male relative, who, as I have said, turned out to be an automobile dealer in Milan.\nThe next day, the Japanese in a surprise attack sank a major fraction of the United States warships at Pearl Harbor, leaving this still pacifistic, antimilitaristic country no choice but to declare war on not only Japan, but on Japan\u2019s allies, Germany and Italy, as well.\nBut even before Pearl Harbor, Marilee told the only man ever to propose marriage to her, and a rich nobleman at that, that no, she would not marry him. She thanked him for happiness such as she had never known before. She said that his proposal and the accompanying document had awakened her from what could only be a dream, and that it was time for her to return to the United States, where she could try to deal with who and what she really was, even though she didn\u2019t have a home there.\nBut then, all excited the next morning about going home, Marilee found the spiritual climate of Rome, although the real Sun was shining brightly and the real clouds were somewhere else, to be as dark and chilling as, and this is how she described it to me in Florence, \u201crain and sleet at midnight.\u201d", 0.15283333333333332], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["weems", 0.3655927574171516], ["foltz", 0.3175938445658695], ["finnerty", 0.2588149026661718], ["stepping", 0.2265754989191976], ["rumpelstiltskin", 0.2265754989191976], ["mirrors", 0.1566184106970453], ["nonexistent", 0.1294074513330859], ["instrument", 0.1132877494595988], ["treated", 0.1132877494595988], ["captain", 0.10552016471248205], ["hypnotized", 0.10385832834080427], ["reported", 0.0971680475861117], ["incredulously", 0.0971680475861117], ["admit", 0.0971680475861117], ["rights", 0.09197866267182775], ["gravely", 0.0841537269364507], ["handed", 0.0841537269364507], ["pass", 0.08104834571262459], ["carney", 0.07364244498893774], ["telephone", 0.0680340250629636], ["people", 0.06611096190377491], ["call", 0.06218950347503555], ["dead", 0.058604603944169074], ["news", 0.05752274311545064], ["real", 0.05363776440235376], ["side", 0.051098245984563244], ["life", 0.04248490207068198], ["man", 0.022079067220498464]], "sentiment": ["Foltz took the nothing he\u2019d been handed, treated it like a telephone.

\u201cget in, get in.\u201d\n30\nTO UNDERSTAND HOW the lower ranks of guards at Athena in those days felt about White people, and never mind Black people, you have to realize that most of them were recruited from Japan\u2019s northernmost island, Hokkaido. On Hokkaido the primitive natives, the Ainus, thought to be very ugly because they were so pallid and hairy, were White people. Genetically speaking, they are just as white as Nancy Reagan. Their ancestors long ago had made the error, when humiliated by superior Asiatic civilizations, of shambling north instead of west to Europe, and eventually, of course, to the Western Hemisphere.\nThose White people on Hokkaido had sure missed a lot. They were way behind practically everybody. And when the man who wanted to teach shop and I presented ourselves at the gate to the road that led through the National Forest to the prison, the 2 guards on duty there were fresh from Hokkaido. For all the respect our being Whites inspired in them, we might as well have been a couple of drunk and disorderly Arapahos.\nTHE MAN WHO wanted to teach shop said his name was John Donner. On the way over he asked me if I had seen him on the Phil Donahue show on TV. That was a 1-hour show every weekday afternoon, which featured a small group of real people, not actors, who had had the same sort of bad thing happen to them, and had triumphed over it or were barely coping or whatever. There were 2 very similar programs in competition with Donahue, and the old novelist Paul Slazinger used to watch all 3 simultaneously, switching back and forth.\nI asked him why he did that. He said he didn\u2019t want to miss the moment when, suddenly, there was absolutely nothing left to talk about.\nI TOLD JOHN Donner that, unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t watch any of those shows, since I taught Music Appreciation in the afternoon, and then Martial Arts after that. I asked him what his particular Donahue show had been about.\n\u201cPeople who were raised in foster homes and got beat up all the time,\u201d he said.\nI WOULD SEE plenty of Donahue reruns at the prison, but not Donner\u2019s. That show would have been coals to Newcastle at Athena, where practically everybody had been beaten regularly and severely when he was a little kid.\nI didn\u2019t see Donner on TV over there, but I did see myself a couple of times, or somebody who looked a whole lot like me in the distance, on old footage of the Vietnam War.", -0.020234374999999995], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["shoes", 0.22244767098024362], ["celia", 0.2102313548888045], ["rudy", 0.19585339774502536], ["threw", 0.1939184125765218], ["walk", 0.13791967749159453], ["doctor", 0.13348664587278872], ["tired", 0.12250832928054252], ["glowing", 0.12250832928054252], ["declaration", 0.12250832928054252], ["coals", 0.12250832928054252], ["conclusion", 0.12250832928054252], ["considers", 0.10638862740705542], ["cynical", 0.10638862740705542], ["gladly", 0.10638862740705542], ["glass", 0.0969592062882609], ["neighborhood", 0.08507954061928437], ["garbage", 0.08507954061928437], ["medicine", 0.08507954061928437], ["magic", 0.08507954061928437], ["alive", 0.07725460488390731], ["glad", 0.07725460488390731], ["honor", 0.07414922366008121], ["walked", 0.06895983874579727], ["broken", 0.06674332293639436], ["husband", 0.059530417627002744], ["love", 0.056619646860630514], ["lost", 0.056619646860630514], ["person", 0.04264816173437632], ["town", 0.03672043499882307]], "sentiment": ["CELIA: You\u2019re my husband.

George M. Helmholtz smiled as he marched along the curb beside it. Inside he was ill, angry, and full of dread. With one cruel stroke, Fate had transformed his plan for winning the trophy into the most preposterous anticlimax in band history.\nHe couldn\u2019t bear to look at the young man on whom he had staked everything. He could imagine Leroy with appalling clarity, slouching along, slovenly, lost in a misfit uniform, a jumble of neuroses and costly fabrics. Leroy was to play alone when the band passed in review. Leroy, Helmholtz reflected, would be incapable even of recalling his own name at that point.\nAhead was the first of a series of chalk marks Helmholtz had made on the curb earlier in the day, carefully measured distances from the reviewing stand.", 0.043473124098124094], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["eichmann", 0.1755337830830319], ["stare", 0.11308859656681762], ["schedule", 0.11308859656681762], ["exercise", 0.09879690212228266], ["murders", 0.09879690212228266], ["joke", 0.0845052076777477], ["note", 0.07296673782340911], ["smuggled", 0.05654429828340881], ["blank", 0.05654429828340881], ["bureaucratic", 0.05654429828340881], ["khan", 0.05654429828340881], ["tape", 0.05654429828340881], ["strike", 0.05654429828340881], ["recorder", 0.05654429828340881], ["assumption", 0.05654429828340881], ["quips", 0.05654429828340881], ["encounter", 0.05654429828340881], ["inspiration", 0.05654429828340881], ["farming", 0.05654429828340881], ["yard", 0.05654429828340881], ["genghis", 0.05654429828340881], ["nodding", 0.05654429828340881], ["set", 0.05592181878867781], ["subtle", 0.04939845106114133], ["lend", 0.04939845106114133], ["respect", 0.04939845106114133], ["mysteriously", 0.04939845106114133], ["sheet", 0.04939845106114133], ["alcohol", 0.04939845106114133], ["generally", 0.04939845106114133], ["memorable", 0.04939845106114133], ["mouth", 0.04939845106114133], ["century", 0.04521839840023243], ["period", 0.04521839840023243], ["unknown", 0.04521839840023243], ["regarded", 0.04521839840023243], ["disappear", 0.04521839840023243], ["wait", 0.04521839840023243], ["tel", 0.04521839840023243], ["aviv", 0.04521839840023243], ["remembering", 0.04225260383887385], ["sit", 0.04225260383887385], ["spare", 0.04225260383887385], ["opinion", 0.04225260383887385], ["day", 0.04038013214174214], ["recognize", 0.03995215485625314], ["jerusalem", 0.03995215485625314], ["hour", 0.03995215485625314], ["parts", 0.03995215485625314], ["dropped", 0.03807255117796495], ["form", 0.03807255117796495], ["youth", 0.03807255117796495], ["offer", 0.036483368911704554], ["listen", 0.036483368911704554], ["wouldn", 0.036483368911704554], ["fat", 0.036483368911704554], ["guards", 0.03510675661660638], ["doubt", 0.03510675661660638], ["picked", 0.03510675661660638], ["half", 0.03510675661660638], ["writing", 0.03280630763398566], ["prison", 0.0318237284607452], ["help", 0.030926703955697472], ["start", 0.030926703955697472], ["man", 0.030809089600778817], ["paper", 0.030101521402362042], ["feet", 0.029337521689437075], ["idea", 0.029337521689437075], ["simply", 0.028626254973076748], ["read", 0.028626254973076748], ["history", 0.028626254973076748], ["mine", 0.027960909394338904], ["killed", 0.027960909394338904], ["feel", 0.027335913293138548], ["book", 0.026746651294788558], ["work", 0.026189257261074374], ["person", 0.025157469028528168], ["lot", 0.024677881238477722], ["wanted", 0.023780856733429993], ["night", 0.02019006607087107], ["years", 0.01931834042109722], ["people", 0.01542075141161217], ["time", 0.012893715761787584]], "sentiment": ["\u201cTell me\u2014\u201d he said, \u201cdo you set a certain time of day aside for writing, whether you feel like it or not\u2014or do you wait for inspiration to strike, night or day?\u201d\n\u201cA schedule,\u201d I said, remembering back so many years.\nI got some of his respect back. \u201cYes, yes\u2014\u201d he said, nodding, \u201ca schedule.

This was one of the memorable quips of the bureaucratic Genghis Khan.\nIt\u2019s possible that Eichmann wanted me to recognize that I had killed a lot of people, too, by the exercise of my fat mouth. But I doubt that he was that subtle a man, man of as many parts as he was. I think, if we ever got right down to it, that, out of the six million murders generally regarded as his, he wouldn\u2019t lend me so much as one.

So it goes.\nThe same general idea appears in The Big Board by Kilgore Trout. The flying saucer creatures who capture Trout\u2019s hero ask him about Darwin. They also ask him about golf.\nIf what Billy Pilgrim learned from the Tralfamadorians is true, that we will all live forever, no matter how dead we may sometimes seem to be, I am not overjoyed.

The pilot had a handlebar mustache. He looked like Adolphe Menjou. He smoked a Cuban cigar while the plane was being fueled. When we took off, there was no talk of fastening seat belts.\nWhen we were up in the air, a young steward served us rye bread and salami and butter and cheese and white wine. The folding tray in front of me would not open out. The steward went into the cockpit for a tool, came back with a beer-can opener. He used it to pry out the tray.\nThere were only six other passengers. They spoke many languages. They were having nice times, too. East Germany was down below, and the lights were on.

This was the only internationally famous human being in Midland City. She was Mary Alice Miller, the Women\u2019s Two Hundred Meter Breast Stroke Champion of the World. She was only fifteen, said Bonnie.\nMary Alice was also the Queen of the Festival of the Arts. The cover of the program showed her in a white bathing suit, with her Olympic Gold Medal hanging around her neck. The medal looked like this:\nMary Alice was smiling at a picture of Saint Sebastian, by the Spanish painter El Greco. It had been loaned to the Festival by Eliot Rosewater, the patron of Kilgore Trout. Saint Sebastian was a Roman soldier who had lived seventeen hundred years before me and Mary Alice Miller and Wayne and Dwayne and all the rest of us. He had secretly become a Christian when Christianity was against the law.\nAnd somebody squealed on him. The Emperor Diocletian had him shot by archers. The picture Mary Alice smiled at with such uncritical bliss showed a human being who was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\nSomething almost nobody knew about Saint Sebastian, incidentally, since painters liked to put so many arrows into him, was that he survived the incident. He actually got well.\nHe walked around Rome praising Christianity and bad-mouthing the Emperor, so he was sentenced to death a second time.
