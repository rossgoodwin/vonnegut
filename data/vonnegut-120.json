Here\u2019s my answer: Many people need desperately to receive this message: \u201cI feel and think much as you do, care about many of the things you care about, although most people don\u2019t care about them. You are not alone.\u201d\nSteve Adams, one of my three adopted nephews, was a successful TV comedy writer in Los Angeles, California, a few years back. His big brother Jim is an ex\u2014Peace Corps guy and now a psychiatric nurse. His kid brother Kurt is a veteran pilot with Continental Airlines, with scrambled eggs on his cap, gold braid on his sleeves. All Steve\u2019s kid brother ever wanted to do for a living was fly. A dream came true!\nSteve learned the hard way that all his jokes for TV had to be about events that had been made much of by TV itself, and very recently. If a joke was about something that hadn\u2019t been on TV for a month or more, the watchers wouldn\u2019t have a clue, even though the laugh track was laughing, as to what they themselves were supposed to laugh about.\nGuess what? TV is an eraser.\nHaving even the immediate past erased may indeed make it more comfortable for most people to get through this thing, whatever it is. Jane, my first wife, won her Phi Beta Kappa key at Swarthmore College over the objections of the History Department. She had written, and then argued in oral examinations, that all that could be learned from history was that history itself was absolutely nonsensical, so study something else, like music.\nI agreed with her, and so would have Kilgore Trout. But history still hadn\u2019t been erased back then. And when I started out as a writer, I could refer to events and personalities in the past, even the distant past, with a reasonable expectation that a fair number of readers would respond with some emotion, whether positive or negative, when I mentioned them.\nCase in point: The murder of the greatest President this country will ever have, Abraham Lincoln, by the twenty-six-year-old ham actor John Wilkes Booth.\nThat assassination was a major event in Timequake One. Who is there left under the age of sixty, and not in a History Department, to give a damn?\n59\nElias Pembroke, a fictitious Rhode Island naval architect who was Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Assistant Secretary of the Navy during our Civil War, was a character in Timequake One. I said he made significant contributions to the design of the power train of the ironclad warship Monitor, but was neglectful of his wife, Julia, who fell in love with a dashing young actor and rakehell named John Wilkes Booth.", 0.19898989898989905], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["ying", 0.15525725925102554], ["pi", 0.15525725925102554], ["kelly",

An hour had passed since the game\u2019s beginning. Five pawns were still alive, among them the young corporal; one bishop, the nervy pilot; two rooks; two knights\u2014ten-year-old frightened knights; Margaret, a rigid, staring queen; and himself, the king. The missing four? Butchered\u2014butchered in senseless exchanges that had cost Pi Ying only blocks of wood. The other soldiers had fallen silent, sullen in their own separate worlds.\n\"I think it\u2019s time for you to concede,\" said Pi Ying. \"It\u2019s just about over, I\u2019m afraid. Do you concede, Colonel?\" Major Barzov frowned wisely at the chessmen, shook his head slowly, and yawned.\nColonel Kelly tried to bring his mind and eyes back into focus. He had the sensation of burrowing, burrowing, burrowing his way through a mountain of hot sand, of having to keep going on and on, digging, squirming, suffocated, blinded. \"Go to hell,\" he muttered. He concentrated on the pattern of the chessmen. As chess, the ghastly game had been absurd. Pi Ying had moved with no strategy other than to destroy white men. Kelly had moved to defend each of his chessmen at any cost, had risked none in offense. His powerful queen, knights, and rooks stood unused in the relative safety of the two rear rows of squares. He clenched and unclenched his fists in frustration. His opponent\u2019s haphazard ranks were wide open. A checkmate of Pi Ying\u2019s king would be possible, if only the black knight weren\u2019t dominating the center of the board.\n\"Your move, Colonel. Two minutes,\" coaxed Pi Ying.\nAnd then Kelly saw it\u2014the price he would pay, that they all would pay, for the curse of conscience. Pi Ying had only to move his queen diagonally, three squares to the left, to put him in check. After that he needed to make one more move\u2014 inevitable, irresistible\u2014and then checkmate, the end. And Pi Ying would move his queen. The game seemed to have lost its piquancy for him; he had the air of a man eager to busy himself elsewhere.\nThe guerrilla chief was standing now, leaning over the balustrade. Major Barzov stood behind him, fitting a cigarette into an ornate ivory holder. \"It\u2019s a very distressing thing about chess,\" said Barzov, admiring the holder, turning it this way and that. \"There isn\u2019t a grain of luck in the game, you know. There\u2019s no excuse for the loser.\" His tone was pedantic, with the superciliousness of a teacher imparting profound truths to students too immature to understand.\nPi Ying shrugged. \"Winning this game gives me very little satisfaction. Colonel Kelly has been a disappointment. By risking nothing, he has deprived the game of its subtlety and wit. I could expect more brilliance from my cook.\"\nThe hot red of anger blazed over Kelly\u2019s cheeks, inflamed his ears. The muscles of his belly knotted; his legs moved apart. Pi Ying must not move his queen. If Pi Ying moved his queen, Kelly would lose; if Pi Ying moved his knight from Kelly\u2019s line of attack, Kelly would win. Only one thing might induce Pi Ying to move his knight\u2014a fresh, poignant opportunity for sadism.\n\"Concede, Colonel.

["\u201cReligious skeptics often become very bitter toward the end, as did Mark Twain. I do not propose to guess now as to why he became so bitter. I know why I will become bitter. I will finally realize that I have had it right all along: that I will not see God, that there is no heaven or Judgment Day.\n\u201cI have used the word \u2019calculations.\u2019 It is a relative of that elegant Missouri verb, \u2019to calculate.\u2019 In Twain\u2019s time, and on the frontier a person who calculated this or that was asking that his lies be respected, since they had been arrived at by means of arithmetic. He wanted you to acknowledge that the arithmetic, the logic of his lies, was sound.\n\u201cI know a rowdy joke which is not fit to tell in mixed company in a Victorian home like this one. I can reveal the final line of it, however, without giving offense. This is it: \u2019Keep your hat on. We may wind up miles from here.\u2019 Any writer beginning a story might well say that to himself: \u2019Keep your hat on. We may wind up miles from here.\u2019\n\u201cThis is the secret of good storytelling: to lie, but to keep the arithmetic sound. A storyteller, like any other sort of enthusiastic liar, is on an unpredictable adventure. His initial lie, his premise, will suggest many new lies of its own. The storyteller must choose among them, seeking those which are most believable, which keep the arithmetic sound. Thus does a story generate itself.\n\u201cThe wildest adventure with storytelling, with Missouri calculation, of which I know is A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\u2019s Court. It was written in this sacredly absurd monument\u2014as were The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, A Tramp Abroad, The Prince and the Pauper, Life on the Mississippi, from which I have quoted, and the world masterpiece, Huckleberry Finn. Twain\u2019s most productive years were spent here\u2014from the time he was thirty-nine until he was my age, which is fifty-six. He was my age when he left here to live in Europe and Redding and New York, his greatest work behind him.\n\u201cThat is how far down the river of life he was when he left here. He could not afford to live here anymore. He was very bad at business.\n\u201cAbout A Connecticut Yankee: Its premise, its first lie, seemed to promise a lark. What could be more comical than sending back into the Dark Ages a late-nineteenth-century optimist and technocrat? Such a premise was surely the key to a treasure chest of screamingly funny jokes and situations. Mark Twain would have been wise to say to himself as he picked up that glittering key: \u2019Keep your hat on. We may wind up miles from here.\u2019\n\u201cI will refresh your memories as to where he wound up, with or without his hat. The Yankee and his little band of electricians and mechanics and what-have-you are being attacked by thousands of English warriors armed with swords and spears and axes. The Yankee has fortified his position with a series, of electric fences and a moat. He also has several precursors to modern machine guns, which are Gatling guns.\n\u201cComically enough, thousands of early attackers have already been electrocuted. Ten thousand of the greatest knights in England have been held in reserve.

"sentiment": ["Delmar and Doris, incidentally, did almost no business up there, and continue to do almost no business up there. I was proud, when I became a RAMJAC executive, that American Harp Company harps were the finest harps in the world. You would have thought that the best harps would come from Italy or Japan or West Germany by now, with American craftsmanship having become virtually extinct. But no\u2014musicians even in those countries and even in the Soviet Union agreed: Only an American Harp Company harp can cut the mustard. But the harp business is not and can never be a volume business, except in heaven, perhaps. So the profit picture, the bottom line, was ridiculous. It is so ridiculous that I recently undertook an investigation of why RAMJAC had ever acquired American Harp. I learned that it was in order to capture the incredible lease on the top of the Chrysler Building. The lease ran until the year Two-thousand and Thirty-one, at a rent of two hundred dollars a month! Arpad Leen wanted to turn the place into a restaurant.\nThat the company also owned a factory in Chicago with sixty-five, employees was a mere detail. If it could not be made to show a substantial profit within a year or two, RAMJAC would close it down.\nPeace.\n16\nMARY KATHLEEN O\u2019LOONEY was, of course, the legendary Mrs. Jack Graham, the majority stockholder in The RAMJAC Corporation. She had her inkpad and pens and writing paper in her basketball shoes. Those shoes were her bank vaults. Nobody could take them off of her without waking her up.\nShe would claim later that she had told me who she really was on the elevator.\nI could only reply, \u201cIf I had heard you say that, Mary Kathleen, I surely would have remembered it.\u201d\nIf I had known who she really was, all her talk about people who wanted to cut off her hands would have made a lot more sense. Whoever got her hands could pickle them and throw away the rest of her, and control The RAMJAC Corporation with just her fingertips. No wonder she was on the run. No wonder she dared not reveal her true identity anywhere.\nNo wonder she dared not-trust anybody. On this particular planet, where money mattered more than anything, the nicest person imaginable might suddenly get the idea of wringing her neck so that their loved ones might live in comfort. It would be the work of the moment\u2014and easily forgotten as the years went by. Time flies.\nShe was so tiny and weak. Killing her and cutting off her hands would have been little more horrifying than what went on ten thousand times a day at a mechanized chicken farm. RAMJAC owns Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken, of course.

Over them hung a long muzzle-loading rifle, powder horn, and bullet pouch. On the mantel were candle molds, a coffee mill, an iron and trivet, and a rusty kettle. An iron cauldron, big enough to boil a missionary in, swung at the end of a long arm in the fireplace, and below it, like so many black offspring, were a cluster of small pots. A wooden butter churn held the door open, and clusters of Indian corn hung from the molding at aesthetic intervals. A colonial scythe stood in one corner, and two Boston rockers on a hooked rug faced the cold fireplace, where the unwatched pot never boiled.\nPaul narrowed his eyes, excluding everything from his field of vision but the colonial tableau, and imagined that he and Anita had pushed this far into the upstate wilderness, with the nearest neighbor twenty-eight miles away. She was making soap, candles, and thick wool clothes for a hard winter ahead, and he, if they weren\u2019t to starve, had to mold bullets and go shoot a bear. Concentrating hard on the illusion, Paul was able to muster a feeling of positive gratitude for Anita\u2019s presence, to thank God for a woman at his side to help with the petrifying amount of work involved in merely surviving. As, in his imagination, he brought home a bear to Anita, and she cleaned it and salted it away, he felt a tremendous lift\u2014the two of them winning by sinew and guts a mountain of strong, red meat from an inhospitable world. And he would mold more bullets, and she would make more candles and soap from the bear fat, until late at night, when Paul and Anita would tumble down together on a bundle of straw in the corner, dog-tired and sweaty, make love, and sleep hard until the brittle-cold dawn\u2026.\n\u201cUrdle-urdle-urdle,\u201d went the automatic washing machine. \u201cUrdle-urdle-ur dull!\u201d\nReluctantly, Paul let his field of vision widen to include the other side of the room, where Anita sat on a ladder-back chair before the cherry breakfront that concealed the laundry console. The console had been rolled from the breakfront, whose fa\u00e7ade of drawers and doors was one large piece, making the breakfront sort of a small garage for the laundry equipment. The doors of a corner cabinet were open, revealing a television screen, which Anita watched intently. A doctor was telling an old lady that her grandson would probably be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life.\n\u201cUrdle-urdle-urdle,\u201d went the console. Anita paid no attention. \u201cZnick. Bazz-wap!\u201d Chimes sounded. Still Anita ignored it. \u201cAzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Froomp!\u201d The top of the console popped open, and a basket of dry laundry burst from it like a great chrysanthemum, white, fragrant, and immaculate.\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Paul.\nAnita motioned for him to be silent, and wait until the program was over, which meant the commercial too. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said at last and turned down the volume. \u201cYour blue suit is laid out on the bed.\u201d\n\u201cOh?

The other faculty members, hearing her do it, recognized instantly the rightness of the accent. It set Schroeder apart, reminded any faculty member who discussed him that Schroeder represented a thrilling responsibility.\nFor Schroeder\u2019s own good, it was kept from him and from the rest of the student body just why Schroeder was such a thrilling responsibility. He was the first authentic genius in the history of Lincoln High.\nSchroeder\u2019s blinding I.Q., like the I.Q. of every student, was a carefully guarded secret in the confidential files in the office of the principal.\nIt was the opinion of George M. Helmholtz, portly head of the music department and director of the Lincoln Ten Square Marching Band, that Schroeder had the stuff to become as great as John Philip Sousa, composer of \u201cStars and Stripes Forever.\u201d\nSchroeder, in his freshman year, learned to play a clarinet well enough in three months to take over the first chair in the band. By the end of his sophomore year, he was master of every instrument in the band. He was now a junior, and the composer of nearly a hundred marches.\nAs an exercise in sight reading, Helmholtz was now putting the beginners\u2019 band, the C Band, through an early Schroeder composition called \u201cHail to the Milky Way.\u201d It was an enthusiastic piece of music, and Helmholtz hoped that the straightforward violence of it would tempt the beginners into really having a go at music. Schroeder\u2019s own comments on the composition pointed out that the star farthest from the earth in the Milky Way was approximately ten thousand light-years away. If the sound of the musical salute was to reach that farthest star, the music would have to be played good and loud.\nThe C Band bleated, shrieked, howled, and squawked at that farthest star gamely. But the musicians dropped out one by one until, as was so often the case, the bass drummer played alone.\nBlom, blom, bloom went the bass drum.

If school had been in session during the epidemic, many, many of them might have wound up with the Shultzes, first where the Pavilion now stands, and then next to the stable, in the shadow of Musket Mountain when the Sun goes down.\nAnd then the student body got lucky again 2 years ago.

Here is why: He told Dwayne that he wished he were a woman instead of a man, because what men did was so often cruel and ugly.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nListen: Bunny Hoover went to Prairie Military Academy for eight years of uninterrupted sports, buggery and Fascism. Buggery consisted of sticking one\u2019s penis in somebody else\u2019s asshole or mouth, or having it done to one by somebody else. Fascism was a fairly popular political philosophy which made sacred whatever nation and race the philosopher happened to belong to. It called for an autocratic, centralized government, headed up by a dictator. The dictator had to be obeyed, no matter what he told somebody to do.\nAnd Bunny would bring new medals with him every time he came home for vacation. He could fence and box and wrestle and swim, he could shoot a rifle and a pistol, fight with bayonets, ride a horse, creep and crawl through shrubbery, peek around corners without being seen.\nHe would show off his medals, and his mother would tell him when his father was out of hearing that she was becoming unhappier with each passing day. She would hint that Dwayne was a monster. It wasn\u2019t true. It was all in her head.\nShe would begin to tell Bunny what was so vile about Dwayne, but she always stopped short. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to hear about such things,\u201d she\u2019d say, even when Bunny was sixteen years old. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you or anybody could do about them anyway.\u201d She would pretend to lock her lips with a key, and then whisper to Bunny, \u201cThere are secrets I will carry to my grave.\u201d\nHer biggest secret, of course, was one that Bunny didn\u2019t detect until she knocked herself off with Dr\u0101no. Celia Hoover was crazy as a bedbug.\nMy mother was, too.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nListen: Bunny\u2019s mother and my mother were different sorts of human beings, but they were both beautiful in exotic ways, and they both boiled over with chaotic talk about love and peace and wars and evil and desperation, of better days coming by and by, of worse days coming by and by.
