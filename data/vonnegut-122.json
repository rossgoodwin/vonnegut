Pembroke, Rhode Island, a town named in honor of an ancestor of her husband\u2018s, to have the kid. She was scared to death that the upper rims of the kid\u2019s ears would be like those of John Wilkes Booth, pointed like a devil\u2019s, instead of curved. But the kid had normal ears. It was a boy. It was christened Abraham Lincoln Pembroke.\nThat the only descendant of the most egomaniacal and destructive villain in American history should bear that name did not become supremely ironical until, exactly two years from the night Booth ejaculated in Julia\u2019s birth canal while she was massively sedated, Booth sent a wad of lead into Lincoln\u2019s dog\u2019s breakfast, into Lincoln\u2019s brain.\nAt Xanadu in 2001, I asked Kilgore Trout for his ballpark opinion of John Wilkes Booth. He said Booth\u2019s performance in Ford\u2019s Theater in Washington, D.C., on the night of Good Friday, April 14th, 1865, when he shot Lincoln and then jumped from a theater box to the stage, breaking his leg, was \u201cthe sort of thing which is bound to happen whenever an actor creates his own material.\u201d\n60\nJulia shared her secret with no one. Did she have regrets? Of course she did, but not about love. When she turned fifty, in 1882, she founded as a memorial for her only love affair, however brief and star-crossed, without saying that\u2019s what it was, an amateur acting group, the Pembroke Mask and Wig Club.\nAnd Abraham Lincoln Pembroke, ignorant of whose son he actually was, in 1889 founded Indian Head Mills, which became the largest textile mill in New England until 1947, when Abraham Lincoln Pembroke III locked out his striking ing employees and moved the company to North Carolina. Abraham Lincoln Pembroke IV subsequently sold it to an international conglomerate, which moved it to Indonesia, and he died of drink.\nNot an actor in the bunch. Not a murderer in the bunch. No pixie ears.\nBefore Abraham Lincoln Pembroke III departed the town of Pembroke for North Carolina, he knocked up an unmarried African-American housemaid, Rosemary Smith. He paid her handsomely for her silence. He was gone when his child Frank Smith was born.\nHold on to your hats!\nFrank Smith has pointed ears! Frank Smith has to be one of the greatest actors in the history of amateur theatricals! He is half black, half white, and only five feet, ten inches tall. But in the summer of 2001 he gave a stunningly convincing matinee performance in the title role in the Pembroke Mask and Wig Club\u2019s production of Abe Lincoln in Illinois, by Robert E.

He bent forward as though to whisper to Pi Ying, but apparently thought better of it. He leaned back against a pillar to watch Kelly\u2019s every move through a gauze of cigarette smoke.\nKelly pretended to be mystified by Pi Ying\u2019s words. And then he buried his face in his hands and gave an agonized cry. \"Oh, God, no!\"\n\"An exquisite mistake, to be sure,\" said Pi Ying. He excitedly explained the blunder to the young girl beside him. She turned away. He seemed infuriated by the gesture.\n\"You\u2019ve got to let me take him back,\" begged Kelly brokenly.\nPi Ying rapped on the balustrade with his knuckles. \"Without rules, my friend, games become nonsense. We agreed that all moves would be final, and so they are.\" He motioned to a servant. \"King\u2019s knight to king\u2019s bishop six!\" The servant moved the piece onto the square where Jerry stood. The bait was taken, the game was Colonel Kelly\u2019s from here on in.\n\"What is he talking about?\" murmured Margaret.\n\"Why keep your wife in suspense, Colonel?\" said Pi Ying. \"Be a good husband and answer her question, or should I?\"\n\"Your husband sacrificed a knight,\" said Barzov, his voice overriding Pi Ying\u2019s. \"You\u2019ve just lost your son.\" His expression was that of an experimenter, keen, expectant, entranced.\nKelly heard the choking sound in Margaret\u2019s throat, caught her as she fell. He rubbed her wrists. \"Darling, please\u2014 listen to me!\" He shook her more roughly than he had intended. Her reaction was explosive. Words cascaded from her\u2014hysterical babble condemning him. Kelly locked her wrists together in his hands and listened dumbly to her broken abuse.\nPi Ying\u2019s eyes bulged, transfixed by the fantastic drama below, oblivious of the tearful frenzy of the young girl behind him.

After his mother died, he would try to immortalize her by having the Maritimo Brothers Construction Company build an arts center on stilts in Sugar Creek, and naming it in her honor.\nMy own mother effectively wrecked that scheme, persuading the community that the arts center and its contents were monstrosities. After that came the neutron bomb. There is nobody left in Midland City anymore to know or care who Mildred Barry might have been.\nThe scheme for turning the empty husks of my town into housing for refugees moves forward apace, incidentally. The President himself has called it \u201ca golden opportunity.\u201d\nBernard Ketchum, our resident shyster here at the Grand Hotel Oloffson, says that Haitian refugees should follow the precedent set by white people, and simply discover Florida or Virginia or Massachusetts or whatever.

But he compounded his mistakes during the first night, before he was sober, by changing course again and again in order to steer for the probable impact points in the ocean of shooting stars. His big brain, remember, had him believing that a meteorite shower was going on. Every time he saw a shooting star, he expected it to hit the ocean and cause a tidal wave.\nSo he would steer for it in order to receive the wave on the ship\u2019s sharp bow. When the sun came up, he could have been, thanks to his big brain, simply anywhere, and headed for simply anywhere.\nMary Hepburn, meanwhile, somewhere between sleep and wakefulness, next to *James Wait, was doing something people don\u2019t have brains enough to do anymore. She was reliving the past. She was a virgin again. She was in a sleeping bag. She was being awakened in the faintest light of dawn, by the call of a whippoorwill. She was camping in an Indiana state park\u2014a living museum, a patch of what the area used to be before Europeans decreed that no plant or animal would be tolerated which was not tamed and edible by humankind. When young Mary stuck her head out of her cocoon, out of her sleeping bag, she saw rotting logs and an undammed stream. She lay on an aromatic mulch of eons of death and discard. There was plenty to eat if you were a microorganism or could digest leaves, but there was no hearty breakfast there for a human being of a million and thirty years ago.\nIt was early June. It was balmy.\nThe bird call was coming from a thicket of briars and sumac fifty paces away. She was glad for this alarm clock, for it had been her intention when she went to sleep to awake this early, and to think of her sleeping bag as a cocoon, and to emerge from it sinuously and voluptuously, as she was now doing, a vivacious adult.\nWhat joy!\nWhat satisfaction!\nIt was perfect, for the girlfriend she had brought with her slept on and on.\nSo she stole across the springy woodland floor to the thicket to see this fellow early bird. What she saw instead was a tall, skinny, earnest young man in a sailor suit. And it was he who was whistling the piercing call of a whippoorwill. This was Roy, her future husband.\nShe was annoyed and disoriented. The sailor suit so far inland was a particularly bizarre detail. She felt intruded upon, and that perhaps she should be frightened as well. But if this very strange person was going to come after her, he would have to get through a tangle of briars first. She had slept in her clothes, so she was fully dressed save for her stocking feet.", 0.12687500000000002], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["slazinger", 0.07727670552273103], ["shoreham", 0.06604004660922486], ["general", 0.052468070230312275], ["battle", 0.04171616974603344], ["bed", 0.03725773294679929], ["lot", 0.03528761900767187], ["24", 0.03302002330461243], ["burgoyne", 0.03302002330461243], ["render", 0.03302002330461243], ["grenadier", 0.03302002330461243], ["freeman", 0.03302002330461243], ["unassisted", 0.03302002330461243], ["undress", 0.03302002330461243], ["uninhabitable", 0.03302002330461243], ["rebel", 0.03302002330461243], ["subtitle", 0.03302002330461243], ["unswad", 0.03302002330461243], ["dreaming", 0.03302002330461243], ["scarier", 0.03302002330461243], ["caring", 0.03302002330461243], ["jockey", 0.03302002330461243], ["chilluns", 0.03302002330461243], ["benedict", 0.03302002330461243], ["opposed", 0.03302002330461243], ["generating", 0.03302002330461243], ["shorts", 0.03302002330461243], ["negro", 0.03302002330461243], ["dled", 0.03302002330461243], ["suspected", 0.03302002330461243], ["confessions", 0.03302002330461243], ["contemplated", 0.03302002330461243], ["frozen", 0.03302002330461243], ["catatonic", 0.03302002330461243], ["pointedly", 0.03302002330461243], ["wiesbaden", 0.03302002330461243], ["commanded", 0.03302002330461243], ["lamb", 0.03302002330461243], ["albany", 0.03302002330461243], ["detail", 0.03302002330461243], ["ancestor", 0.03302002330461243], ["colonized", 0.03302002330461243], ["mercenary", 0.03302002330461243], ["bloomer", 0.03302002330461243], ["british", 0.03138268758122759], ["widow", 0.03062487980852216], ["pill", 0.02868785342611277], ["fabulously", 0.02868785342611277], ["adolph", 0.02868785342611277], ["bay", 0.02868785342611277], ["architecture", 0.02868785342611277], ["dunes", 0.02868785342611277], ["gottlieb", 0.02868785342611277], ["nuclear", 0.02868785342611277], ["buster", 0.02868785342611277], ["limp", 0.02868785342611277], ["arnold", 0.02868785342611277], ["defeated", 0.02868785342611277], ["hessian", 0.02868785342611277], ["straitjacket", 0.02868785342611277], ["forces", 0.02868785342611277], ["plant", 0.02868785342611277], ["centuries", 0.02868785342611277], ["desert", 0.02868785342611277], ["second", 0.028593393189799973], ["sooner", 0.02615369650043674], ["freak", 0.02615369650043674], ["cobbler", 0.02615369650043674], ["shirt", 0.02615369650043674], ["entitled", 0.02615369650043674], ["plan", 0.02615369650043674], ["wanted", 0.02531383988395633], ["room", 0.024842085784170746], ["serving", 0.024355683547613114], ["photographs", 0.024355683547613114], ["rescue", 0.024355683547613114], ["thousands", 0.024355683547613114], ["decades", 0.024355683547613114], ["farm", 0.024355683547613114], ["prisoner", 0.024355683547613114], ["continent", 0.022961036351899302], ["delivered", 0.022961036351899302], ["loose", 0.022961036351899302], ["hundreds", 0.022961036351899302], ["armenian", 0.02271834782422828], ["night", 0.022333702090893855], ["spiritual", 0.021821526621937086], ["sounds", 0.021821526621937086], ["shoes", 0.02085808487301672], ["fireplace", 0.02085808487301672], ["insurance", 0.02085808487301672], ["squad", 0.02085808487301672], ["planet", 0.02085808487301672], ["island", 0.020023513669113455], ["moved", 0.020023513669113455], ["listen", 0.020023513669113455], ["circe", 0.01962039577542101], ["window", 0.019287369696261058], ["moving", 0.019287369696261058], ["john", 0.019287369696261058], ["germany", 0.019287369696261058], ["people", 0.018872580182286245], ["sleep", 0.018628866473399643], ["kill", 0.018628866473399643], ["ocean", 0.018628866473399643], ["pretty", 0.018033177849622613], ["clothes", 0.018033177849622613], ["named", 0.018033177849622613], ["north", 0.017489356743437427], ["learn", 0.017489356743437427], ["arrived", 0.016989089820477823], ["son", 0.016525914994517065], ["supposed", 0.016094709547723615], ["hours", 0.015691343790613797], ["number", 0.015691343790613797], ["floor", 0.015691343790613797], ["late", 0.01531243990426108], ["foyer", 0.01531243990426108], ["feel", 0.014955199817761401], ["turned", 0.014955199817761401], ["simply", 0.014617279684822177], ["incidentally", 0.013991758068841035], ["beach", 0.013701007971122956], ["berman", 0.013113715301759116], ["book", 0.012656919941978165], ["guess", 0.012656919941978165], ["family", 0.012421042892085373], ["god", 0.01135917391211414], ["american", 0.011166851045446928], ["ago", 0.011166851045446928], ["work", 0.010285109806322516], ["will", 0.00882501698643811], ["long", 0.008088873013585714], ["good", 0.0074303697907242994], ["house", 0.00712543126466535], ["years", 0.00579059313780248]], "sentiment": ["24\nSLAZINGER WAS A LAMB when they unswad-dled him. \u201cJust put me to bed,\u201d he said.

He wanted that room and no other, and seemed to feel entitled to sleep there. So he must have been dreaming in detail of moving in with me for hours at least, and maybe even for decades. I was his insurance plan. Sooner or later, he would simply give up, go limp, and have himself delivered to the beach house of a fabulously well-to-do Armenian.\nHe, incidentally, was from a very old American family. The first Slazinger on this continent was a Hessian grenadier serving as a mercenary with General John Burgoyne, the British general who was defeated by forces commanded in part by the rebel General Benedict Arnold, who would later desert to the British, at the second Battle of Freeman\u2019s Farm, north of Albany, two hundred years ago. Slazinger\u2019s ancestor was taken prisoner during the battle, and never went home, which was in Wiesbaden, Germany, where he had been the son of\u2014guess what?\nA cobbler.\n\u201cAll God\u2019s chilluns got shoes.\u201d\n\u2014OLD NEGRO SPIRITUAL\nI would have to say that the widow Berman was a lot scarier than Slazinger the night Slazinger arrived in a straitjacket. He was pretty much the same old Slazinger when the Rescue Squad turned him loose in the foyer. But Circe, almost catatonic, was a Circe I had never seen before.\nSo I put Slazinger to bed unassisted. I didn\u2019t undress him. He didn\u2019t have that many clothes on anyway\u2014just Jockey shorts and a T-shirt that said, STOP SHOREHAM. Shoreham is a nuclear generating plant not far away. If it didn\u2019t work the way it was supposed to, it might kill hundreds of thousands of people and render Long Island uninhabitable for centuries. A lot of people were opposed to it. A lot of people were for it. I myself think about it as little as possible.\nI will say this about it, although I have only seen it in photographs. Never have I contemplated architecture which said more pointedly to one and all: \u201cI am from another planet. I have no way of caring what you are or what you want or what you do.

were so stupid that they could only make things worse by speaking their minds. It was thinkers, after all, who had set up the death camps. Setting up a death camp, with its railroad sidings and its around-the-clock crematoria, was not something a moron could do. Neither could a moron explain why a death camp was ultimately humane.\nAgain: peace.\nSo there Mary Kathleen and I were\u2014among all those harps. They are very strange-looking instruments, now that I think about them, and not very far from poor Ruth\u2019s idea of civilization even in peace-time\u2014impossible marriages between Greek columns and Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s flying machines.\nHarps are self-destructive, incidentally. When I found myself in the harp business at RAMJAC, I had hoped that American Harp had among its assets some wonderful old harps that would turn out to be as valuable as Stradivari\u2019s and the Amatis\u2019 violins. There was zero chance for this dream\u2019s coming true. The tensions in a harp are so tremendous and unrelenting that it becomes unplayable after fifty years and belongs on a dump or in a museum.\nI discovered something fascinating about prothonotary warblers, too. They are the only birds that are housebroken in captivity. You would think that the harps would have to be protected from bird droppings by canopies\u2014but not at all! The warblers deposit their droppings in teacups that are set around. In a state of nature, evidently, they deposit their droppings in other birds\u2019 nests. That is what they think the teacups are.\nLive and learn!\nBut back to Mary Kathleen and me among all those harps\u2014with the prothonotary warblers overhead and the police on their way:\n\u201cAfter my husband died, Walter,\u201d she said, \u201cI became so unhappy and lost that I turned to alcohol.\u201d That husband would have been Jack Graham, the reclusive engineer who had founded The RAMJAC Corporation. He had not built the company from scratch. He had been born a multimillionaire. So far as I knew, of course, she might have been talking about a plumber or a truck driver or a college professor or anyone.\nShe told about going to a private sanitarium in Louisville, Kentucky, where she was given shock treatments. These blasted all her memories from Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-five until Nineteen-hundred and Fifty-five. That would explain why she thought she could still trust me now. Her memories of how callously I had left her, and of my later betrayal of Leland Clewes and all that, had been burned away. She was able to believe that I was still the fiery idealist I had been in Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-five. She had missed my part in Watergate.

I would teach English as a second language or help local glassblowers get their wares into American department stores, and so on.\nZuzu was also a pretty good photographer, so I said she would soon be hanging around where the gondolas took on passengers, and selling tourists Polaroid pictures of themselves in gondolas right then and there.\nWhen it came to dreaming up a future for ourselves, we left GRIOT\u2122 in the dust.\nI CONSIDERED THOSE dreams of Venice part of lovemaking, my erotic analogue to Zuzu\u2019s perfume.

They were as easy to move, usually, as toy balloons.\nAnd they would drift hither and yon, like balloons filled with some gas slightly heavier than air, until they came to rest in Skid Row, against the foundations of the old Fairchild Hotel.\nThey could snooze and mumble to each other all day long.
