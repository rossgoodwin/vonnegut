from The Paris Review. \u201cThe reviewer for the Sunday Times actually asked critics who had praised me in the past to now admit in public how wrong they had been.\u2026 The hidden complaint was that I was barbarous, that I wrote without having made a \u2026 study of great literature, that I was no gentleman, that I had done hack writing so cheerfully for vulgar magazines\u2014that I had not paid my academic dues.\u201d\nThe interviewer asked if after the barrage of bad reviews he \u201cneeded comforting.\u201d\n\u201cI never felt worse in my life,\u201d Kurt answered. \u201cAll of a sudden critics wanted me squashed like a bug.\u201d\nMaybe it felt like being stuffed in a trash can by the high school jocks.\nVonnegut has often\u2014and aptly\u2014been compared to Mark Twain, as a public speaker as well as a writer. When the critic Granville Hicks reviewed Slaughterhouse-Five, he wrote that he had heard Vonnegut give a speech once and that he had \u201ca vernacular appeal\u201d like Twain\u2019s and a \u201cpersonal presence\u201d that was captured in his novel. Kurt told Jerome Klinkowitz, \u201cPeople do seem to like my work best when they\u2019ve heard me speak first.\u201d\nThe first time I heard Kurt give a speech was at a Unitarian Universalist General Assembly in Rochester, New York, in the eighties. The Unitarians are the only religious denomination that Vonnegut could comfortably identify with, since they have no creed or dogma and \u201cwelcome people of different beliefs\u201d including \u201cAtheism and Agnosticism, Buddhism, Humanism, Paganism, and other religious or philosophical traditions,\u201d according to the \u201cBeliefs and Principles\u201d explained on their website. They even include Christians, and I was there as a member of King\u2019s Chapel in Boston, one of the few Christian churches in the Unitarian Universalist Association.\nMost Unitarian churches are Humanist, and though Kurt was not a member of a church, he was honorary president of the American Humanist Society, which made him a highly appropriate speaker for this assembly. He described himself as a \u201cChrist-loving atheist\u201d and has said, \u201cIn order not to seem a spiritual quadriplegic, to strangers trying to get a fix on me, I sometimes say I\u2019m a Unitarian Universalist.\u201d\nKurt started his talk with a surefire crowd-pleaser for the occasion. He was wearing a round pin on his lapel, like a political campaign button, and he said it explained his admiration for the Unitarians. \u201cIt has a picture of a frankfurter and a big \u2018X\u2019 through it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means, \u2018No Baloney.\u2019 \u201d That brought cheers as well as laughs. He was off and running, and, as usual, he won over his audience, which he was able to do regardless of the occasion. I heard him speak in different places for different purposes after that, and whether speaking with anger and passion against the first invasion of Iraq at All Souls Unitarian Church in New York or with humor and nostalgia on \u201cSpirit and Place\u201d at Butler University in Indianapolis, he was always able to do as a speaker what he did as a writer, which was follow E. M. Forster\u2019s rule: \u201cOnly connect!\u201d\nKurt connected with friends as well as with audiences. One of the elements that run throughout these letters I chose out of more than a thousand is the sustaining friendships that ran throughout his life, from kindergarten to high school and Cornell and the Army, with relatives from home (even those who dismissed his books), his children, his students, teaching colleagues, fellow writers, scholars and critics who wrote about his work.

Kurt liked to laugh and make other people laugh, sometimes with silly jokes that came out of the blue.

service at the bar. He was appalled to discover that the club was nothing but a shack fourteen feet wide and thirty feet long, a touch of the Ozarks in Massachusetts. It contained an hilariously warped ping-pong table, a wire lost-and-found basket with sandy, fragrant contents, and an upright piano that had been under a leak in the roof for years.\nThere wasn\u2019t any bar, any telephone, any electricity. There weren\u2019t any members there, either. To cap it all, there wasn\u2019t a drop of water in the harbor. The tide, which can be as great as fourteen feet, was utterly out. And the so-called yachts, antique wooden Rhodes 18\u2019s, Beetlecats, and a couple of Boston Whalers, were resting on the bluish-brown glurp of the emptied harbor\u2019s floor. Clouds of gulls and terns were yelling about all that glurp, and about all the good things in it they were finding to eat.\nA few men were out there, too, digging clams as fat as partridges from the rim of Sandy Neck, the ten-mile-long sand finger that separates the harbor from the ice-cold bay. And ducks and geese and herons and other waterfowl were out there, too, teemingly, in the great salt marsh that bounds the harbor on the west. And, near the harbor\u2019s narrow mouth, a yawl from Marblehead with a six-foot keel lay on her side, waiting for the water to come back in again. She should never have come to Barnstable Village, not with a keel like that.\nThe salesman, very depressed, insensitive to the barbarous beauty all around him, went to lunch. Since he was in the seat of the most booming county in New England, Barnstable County, and since the boom was a tourist boom, he had reason to expect something mildly voluptuous in the way of a place to eat. What he had to settle for, though, was a chromium stool at a formica counter in an aggressively un-cute, un-colonial institution called the Barnstable News Store, another Ozarks touch, an Ozarks department store. The motto of the place: \"If it\u2019s any good, we\u2019ve got it. If it\u2019s no good, we\u2019ve sold it.\"\nAfter lunch, he went trustee-hunting again, was told to try the village museum, which is in the old brick Customs House. The building itself is a memorial to long-gone days when the harbor was used by fair-sized ships, before it filled up with all that bluish-brown glurp. There was no trustee there, and the exhibits were excruciatingly boring. The salesman found himself strangling on apathy, an affliction epidemic among casual visitors to Barnstable Village.\nHe took the customary cure, which was to jump into his car and roar off toward the cocktail lounges, motor courts, bowling alleys, gift shoppes, and pizzerias of Hyannis, the commercial heart of Cape Cod. He there worked off his frustrations on a miniature golf course called Playland. At that time, that particular course had a pathetic, maddening feature typical of the random butchery of the Cape\u2019s south shore. The course was built on the lawn of what had once been an American Legion Post\u2014and, right in the middle of the cunning little bridges and granulated cork fairways was a Sherman tank, set there in simpler and less enterprising days as a memorial to the veterans of World War Two.\nThe memorial has since been moved, but it is still on the south side, where it is bound to be engulfed by indignities again.\nThe dignity of the tank would be a lot safer in Barnstable Village, but the village would never accept it. It has a policy of never accepting anything. As a happy consequence, it changes about as fast as the rules of chess.\nThe biggest change in recent years has taken place at the polls. Until six years ago, the Democratic poll watchers and the Republican poll watchers were all Republicans. Now the Democratic poll watchers are Democrats. The consequences of this revolution have not been nearly as awful as expected\u2014so far.\nAnother break with the past has to do with the treasury of the local amateur theatrical society, the Barnstable Comedy Club. The club had a treasurer who, once a month for thirty years, angrily refused to say what the balance was, for fear that the club would spend it foolishly. He resigned last year. The new treasurer announced a balance of four hundred dollars and some odd cents, and the membership blew it all on a new curtain the color of spoiled salmon. This ptomaine curtain, incidentally, made its debut during a production of The Caine Mutiny Court Martial in which Captain Queeg did not nervously rattle steel balls in his hand. The balls were eliminated on the theory that they were suggestive.", -0.008190094219505986], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["hath", 0.6855996166863318], ["scott", 0.2285332055621106], ["er", 0.2285332055621106], ["ne", 0.2285332055621106], ["strand", 0.2285332055621106], ["wandering", 0.2285332055621106], ["breathes", 0.2285332055621106], ["footsteps", 0.2285332055621106], ["1", 0.19965207303877955], ["walter", 0.19965207303877955], ["tiglath", 0.18275769353427274], ["burn", 0.18275769353427274], ["pileser", 0.18275769353427274], ["foreign", 0.18275769353427274], ["sir", 0.1614732925440231], ["native", 0.1614732925440231], ["turn", 0.1614732925440231], ["land", 0.15387656101094166], ["soul", 0.14745361601813922], ["heart", 0.12862090252884517], ["dead", 0.08284539050100728], ["man", 0.04150669015660479]], "sentiment": ["Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,\nWho never to himself hath said,\n\u201cThis is my own, my native land!\u201d\nWhose heart hath ne\u2019er within him\nburn\u2019d\nAs home his footsteps he hath turn\u2019d\nFrom wandering on a foreign strand?\n\u2014SIR WALTER SCOTT\n1\nTIGLATH-PILESER", 0.09166666666666666], "title": "Mother Night"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["tense", 0.2126884272845719], ["ambassador", 0.12533454735625707], ["creole", 0.09523558054343213], ["detonated", 0.07216244053511409], ["reference", 0.07216244053511409], ["beginner", 0.07216244053511409], ["fantasy", 0.07216244053511409], ["hungary", 0.07216244053511409], ["viewpoint", 0.07216244053511409], ["wand", 0.07216244053511409], ["borrowed", 0.07216244053511409], ["unharmed", 0.07216244053511409], ["penfield", 0.07216244053511409], ["misrepresented", 0.07216244053511409], ["enthusiasts", 0.07216244053511409], ["connecticut", 0.07216244053511409], ["easiest", 0.07216244053511409], ["destruction", 0.07216244053511409], ["frederic", 0.07216244053511409], ["neutrom", 0.07216244053511409], ["courtland", 0.07216244053511409], ["bomb", 0.06365531999717501], ["peace", 0.06266727367812853], ["learning", 0.06266727367812853], ["1892", 0.06266727367812853], ["swains", 0.06266727367812853], ["populated", 0.06266727367812853], ["fiction", 0.06266727367812853], ["outbreak", 0.06266727367812853], ["instantly", 0.06266727367812853], ["dialect", 0.06266727367812853], ["kills", 0.06266727367812853], ["suffering", 0.06266727367812853], ["commend", 0.06266727367812853], ["henry", 0.05711295712870162], ["clowes", 0.05711295712870162], ["austria", 0.05317210682114298], ["described", 0.05317210682114298], ["actual", 0.05317210682114298], ["leaves", 0.05317210682114298], ["french", 0.05317210682114298], ["waltz", 0.05207020079662614], ["1960", 0.05011534584423599], ["magic", 0.05011534584423599], ["third", 0.05011534584423599], ["example", 0.05011534584423599], ["speaking", 0.047617790271716066], ["states", 0.04550613712339746], ["area", 0.04550613712339746], ["character", 0.04550613712339746], ["property", 0.04550613712339746], ["united", 0.043676939964157425], ["otto", 0.043676939964157425], ["war", 0.03943059623491049], ["book", 0.038122623414730515], ["history", 0.038122623414730515], ["real", 0.03702614796714783], ["neutron", 0.03506586243782354], ["sort", 0.027530981110162275], ["ohio", 0.024686606250186323], ["rudy", 0.023073140008318054], ["lot", 0.020961486859999448], ["celia", 0.020639151279037884], ["time", 0.013577973151332502], ["people", 0.013202644737796691]], "sentiment": ["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis is fiction, not history, so it should not be used as a reference book.

The actual ambassador at that time was Frederic Courtland Penfield of Connecticut.\nI also say that a neutron bomb is a sort of magic wand, which kills people instantly, but which leaves their property unharmed. This is a fantasy borrowed from enthusiasts for a Third World War. A real neutrom bomb, detonated in a populated area, would cause a lot more suffering and destruction than I have described.\nI have also misrepresented Creole, just as the viewpoint character, Rudy Waltz, learning that French dialect, might do.

You\u2019re thinner than I expected \u2014 a whole lot thinner \u2014 but otherwise she kept me pretty well posted. She was a lot better letter writer than I am. I know you\u2019re quite a piano player, for one thing, and that you were looking forward to going to Chicago to study at the Conservatory this winter, before all this happened. That right?\u201d\n\u201cYessir, it is. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGood for you. If there\u2019s anything I admire in a man, it\u2019s ambition.

He settled into a chair, and lit a cigarette. \u201cHere you are sixteen, and you\u2019ve already finished up high school. Wish you\u2019d give some of your brains to Kitty.

I see you aren\u2019t, but I\u2019ll tell it to you anyway. I learned a lot from what happened to him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like very much to hear about it,\u201d said Haley.\n\u201cWell, Haley, this boyhood chum of mine was a lot like you, from what I\u2019ve heard about you.

By the time he was fifteen, he knew more about the royal family of Siam and the slum problem in Vladivostok than I knew about the back of my hand.

O\u2019Hare if I could come to see him. He was a district attorney in Pennsylvania. I was a writer on Cape Cod. We had been privates in the war, infantry scouts. We had never expected to make any money after the war, but we were doing quite well.\nI had the Bell Telephone Company find him for me. They are wonderful that way. I have this disease late at night sometimes, involving alcohol and the telephone. I get drunk, and I drive my wife away with a breath like mustard gas and roses. And then, speaking gravely and elegantly into the telephone, I ask the telephone operators to connect me with this friend or that one, from whom I have not heard in years.\nI got O\u2019Hare on the line in this way. He is short and I am tall. We were Mutt and Jeff in the war. We were captured together in the war. I told him who I was on the telephone. He had no trouble believing it. He was up. He was reading. Everybody else in his house was asleep.\n\u201cListen\u2014\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m writing this book about Dresden. I\u2019d like some help remembering stuff. I wonder if I could come down and see you, and we could drink and talk and remember.\u201d\nHe was unenthusiastic. He said he couldn\u2019t remember much. He told me, though, to come ahead.\n\u201cI think the climax of the book will be the execution of poor old Edgar Derby,\u201d I said. \u201cThe irony is so great.

You have to say, \u201cNo,\u201d when I hold up my hand like this. All right? Don\u2019t let me down.\nDo you know why cream is so much more expensive then milk?\nAUDIENCE: No.\nIt is because the cows hate to squat on those little bottles.\nThat is the best joke I know. One time when I worked for the General Electric Company over in Schenectady, I had to write speeches for company officers. I put that joke about the cows and the little bottles in a speech for a vice president. He was reading along, and he had never heard the joke before. He couldn\u2019t stop laughing, and he had to be led away from the podium with a nosebleed. I was fired the next day.\nHow do jokes work? The beginning of each good one challenges you to think. We are such earnest animals. When I asked you about cream, you could not help yourselves. You really tried to think of a sensible answer. Why does a chicken cross the road? Why does a fireman wear red suspenders? Why did they bury George Washington on the side of a hill?\nThe second part of the joke announces that nobody wants you to think, nobody wants to hear your wonderful answer. You are so relieved to at last meet somebody who doesn\u2019t demand that you be intelligent. You laugh for joy.\nI have in fact designed this entire speech so as to allow you to be as stupid as you like, without strain, and without penalties of any kind. I have even written a ridiculous song for the occasion. It lacks music, but we are up to our necks in composers. One is sure to come along.

So is this one, not all that well disguised.\nThe German Empire, allied with the Turks, sent impassive military observers to evaluate this century\u2019s first genocide, a word which did not exist in any language then. The word is now understood everywhere to mean a carefully planned effort to kill every member, be it man, woman, or child, of a perceived subfamily of the human race.\nThe problems presented by such ambitious projects are purely industrial: how to kill that many big, resourceful animals cheaply and quickly, make sure that nobody gets away, and dispose of mountains of meat and bones afterwards. The Turks, in their pioneering effort, had neither the aptitude for really big business nor the specialized machinery required. The Germans would exhibit both par excellence only one quarter of a century later. The Turks simply took all the Armenians they could find in their homes or places of work or refreshment or play or worship or education or whatever, marched them out into the countryside, and kept them away from food and water and shelter, and shot and bashed them and so on until they all appeared to be dead. It was up to dogs and vultures and rodents and so on, and finally worms, to clean up the mess afterwards.\nMy mother, who wasn\u2019t yet my mother, only pretended to be dead among the corpses.\nMy father, who wasn\u2019t yet her husband, hid in the shit and piss of a privy behind the schoolhouse where he was a teacher when the soldiers came. The school day was over, and my father-to-be was all alone in the schoolhouse writing poetry, he told me one time. Then he heard the soldiers coming and understood what they meant to do. Father never saw or heard the actual killing. For him, the stillness of the village, of which he was the only inhabitant at nightfall, all covered with shit and piss, was his most terrible memory of the massacre.\nAlthough my mother\u2019s memories from the Old World were more gruesome than my father\u2019s, since she was right there in the killing fields, she somehow managed to put the massacre behind her and find much to like in the United States, and to daydream about a family future here.\nMy father never did.\nI am a widower. My wife, nee Edith Taft, who was my second such, died two years ago. She left me this nineteen-room house on the waterfront of East Hampton, Long Island, which had been in her Anglo-Saxon family from Cincinnati, Ohio, for three generations. Her ancestors surely never expected it to fall into the hands of a man with a name as exotic as Rabo Karabekian.\nIf they haunt this place, they do it with such Episcopalian good manners that no one has so far noticed them. If I were to come upon the spook of one of them on the grand staircase, and he or she indicated that I had no rights to this house, I would say this to him or her: \u201cBlame the Statue of Liberty.\u201d\nDear Edith and I were happily married for twenty years. She was a grandniece of William Howard Taft, the twenty-seventh president of the United States and the tenth chief justice of the Supreme Court. She was the widow of a Cincinnati sportsman and investment banker named Richard Fairbanks, Jr., himself descended from Charles Warren Fairbanks, a United States senator from Indiana and then

And every time he got there he dropped a suggestion in the suggestion box. It was always the same suggestion: \u201cWhy not make next year\u2019s refrigerator in the shape of a woman?\u201d Then there would be a sketch of a refrigerator shaped like a woman, with arrows showing where the vegetable crisper and the butter conditioner and the ice cubes and all would go.\nGeorge called it the Food-O-Mama. Everybody thought the Food-O-Mama was an extra-good joke because George was out on the road all year long, dancing and talking and singing with a refrigerator shaped like a refrigerator. Its name was Jenny.

That first piece of solid evidence would not be lonesome long.\nMushari went back to his cubicle, reflected that Sylvia was in the process of divorcing Eliot, with old McAllister representing the defendant. She was living in Paris, and Mushari wrote a letter to her, suggesting that it was customary in friendly, civilized divorce actions for litigants to return each other's letters. He asked her to send him any letters from Eliot that she might have saved.\nHe got fifty-three such letters by return mail.\n2\nELIOT ROSEWATER was born in 1918, in Washington, D.C. Like his father, who claimed to represent the Hoosier State, Eliot was raised and educated and entertained on the Eastern Seaboard and in Europe. The family visited the so-called \"home\" in Rosewater County very briefly every year, just long enough to reinvigorate the lie that it was home.\nEliot had unremarkable academic careers at Loomis and Harvard.

Hapgood was then a labor union officer, a vice-president of the local CIO. His wife Mary had been the Socialist Party\u2019s candidate for vice-president of the United States again and again.\nIn fact, the first time I voted in a national election I voted for Norman Thomas and Mary Hapgood, not even knowing that she was an Indianapolis person. Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S Truman won. I imagined that I was a socialist. I believed that socialism would be good for the common man. As a private first class in the infantry, I was surely a common man.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe meeting with Hapgood came about because I had told Uncle Alex that I might try to get a job with a labor union after the Army let me go. Unions were admirable instruments for extorting something like economic justice from employers then.\nUncle Alex must have thought something like this: \u201cGod help us. Against stupidity even the gods contend in vain. Well\u2014at least there is a Harvard man with whom he can discuss this ridiculous dream.\u201d\n(It was Schiller who first said that about stupidity and the gods. This was Nietzsche\u2019s reply: \u201cAgainst boredom even the gods contend in vain.\u201d)\nSo Uncle Alex and I sat down at a front table in Stegemeier\u2019s and ordered beers and waited for Father and Hapgood to arrive. They would be coming separately. If they had come together, they would have had nothing to say to each other on the way. Father by then had lost all interest in politics and history and economics and such things. He had taken to saying that people talked too much. Sensations meant more to him than ideas\u2014especially the feel of natural materials at his fingertips. When he was dying about twenty years later, he would say that he wished he had been a potter, making mud pies all day long.\nTo me that was sad\u2014because he was so well-educated.

Bud had shown off its special features to him several times, and, playfully, Paul put it through its paces. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said to the car.\nA whir and a click, and the door flew open. \u201cHop in,\u201d said a tape recording under the dashboard. The starter spun, the engine caught and idled down, and the radio went on.\nGingerly, Paul pressed a button on the steering column. A motor purred, gears grumbled softly, and the two front seats lay down side by side like sleepy lovers. It struck Paul as shockingly like an operating table for horses he had once seen in a veterinary hospital\u2014where the horse was walked alongside the tipped table, lashed to it, anesthetized, and then toppled into operating position by the gear-driven table top. He could see Katharine Finch sinking, sinking, sinking, as Bud, his hand on the button, crooned. Paul raised the seats with another button. \u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said to the car.\nThe motor stopped, the radio winked off, and the door slammed. \u201cDon\u2019t take any wooden nickels,\u201d called the car as Paul climbed into his own. \u201cDon\u2019t take any wooden nickels, don\u2019t take any wooden nickels, don\u2019t take any\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d\nBud\u2019s car fell silent, apparently at peace.\nPaul drove down the broad, clean boulevard that split the plant, and watched the building numbers flash by. A station wagon, honking its horn, and its occupants waving to him, shot past in the opposite direction, playfully zigzagging on the deserted street, heading for the main gate. Paul glanced at his watch. That was the second shift just coming off work. It annoyed him that sophomoric high spirits should be correlated with the kind of young men it took to keep the plant going. Cautiously, he assured himself that when he, Finnerty, and Shepherd had come to work in the Ilium Works thirteen years before, they had been a good bit more adult, less cock-sure, and certainly without the air of belonging to an elite.\nSome people, including Paul\u2019s famous father, had talked in the old days as though engineers, managers, and scientists were an elite. And when things were building up to the war, it was recognized that American know-how was the only answer to the prospective enemy\u2019s vast numbers, and there was talk of deeper, thicker shelters for the possessors of know-how, and of keeping this cream of the population out of the front-line fighting. But not many had taken the idea of an elite to heart. When Paul, Finnerty, and Shepherd had graduated from college, early in the war, they had felt sheepish about not going to fight, and humbled by those who did go. But now this elite business, this assurance of superiority, this sense of rightness about the hierarchy topped by managers and engineers\u2014this was instilled in all college graduates, and there were no bones about it.\nPaul felt better when he got into Building 58, a long, narrow structure four blocks long. It was a pet of his. He\u2019d been told to have the north end of the building torn down and replaced, and he\u2019d talked Headquarters out of it. The north end was the oldest building in the plant, and Paul had saved it\u2014because of its historical interest to visitors, he\u2019d told Headquarters. But he discouraged and disliked visitors, and he\u2019d really saved Building 58\u2019s north end for himself. It was the original machine shop set up by Edison in 1886, the same year in which he opened another in Schenectady, and visiting it took the edge off Paul\u2019s periods of depression. It was a vote of confidence from the past, he thought\u2014where the past admitted how humble and shoddy it had been, where one could look from the old to the new and see that mankind really had come a long way. Paul needed that reassurance from time to time.\nObjectively, Paul tried to tell himself, things really were better than ever. For once, after the great bloodbath of the war, the world really was cleared of unnatural terrors\u2014mass starvation, mass imprisonment, mass torture, mass murder.

I don\u2019t know what school you belong to. My school is presently comprised of Littauer & Wilkenson (my agents), and Burger, and nobody else. For want of support from any other quarter, I write for them\u2014high grade, slick bombast.\nI\u2019ve been on my own for five weeks now. I\u2019ve rewritten a novelette, and turned out a short-short and a couple of 5,000-worders. Some of them will sell, probably. This is Sunday, and the question arises, what\u2019ll I start tomorrow? I already know what the answer is. I also know it\u2019s the wrong answer. I\u2019ll start something to please L&W, Inc., and Burger, and, please, God, MGM.\nThe obvious alternative is, of course, something to please the Atlantic, Harpers, or the New Yorker. To do this would be to turn out something after the fashion of somebody-or-other, and I might be able to do it. I say might. It amounts to signing on with any of a dozen schools born ten, twenty, thirty years ago. The kicks are based largely on having passed off a creditable counterfeit. And, of course, if you appear in the Atlantic or Harpers or the New Yorker, by God you must be a writer, because everybody says so. This is poor competition for the fat checks from the slicks. For want of anything more tempting, I\u2019ll stick with money.\nSo, having said that much, where am I? In Alplaus, New York, I guess, wishing I could pick up some fire and confidence and originality and fresh prejudices from somewhere. As Slotkin said, these things are group products. It isn\u2019t a question of finding a Messiah, but of a group\u2019s creating one\u2014and it\u2019s hard work, and takes a while.\nIf this sort of thing is going on somewhere (not in Paris, says Tennessee Williams), I\u2019d love to get in on it. I\u2019d give my right arm to be enthusiastic. God knows there\u2019s plenty to write about\u2014more now than ever before, certainly. You\u2019re defaulting, I\u2019m defaulting, everyone\u2019s defaulting, seems to me.\nIf Slotkin\u2019s right, maybe the death of the institution of friendship is the death of innovation in the arts.\nThis letter is sententious crap, shot full of self-pity. But it\u2019s the kind of letter writers seem to write; and since I quit G-E, if I\u2019m not a writer then I\u2019m nothing.\nYours truly,\nDisturbed personality\nCONFIDO", 0.09586247086247088], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["penguin", 0.40937495816215336], ["group", 0.27291663877476885], ["australia", 0.18371835442556253], ["canada", 0.13645831938738442], ["division", 0.12263564524733338], ["camberwell", 0.12247890295037503], ["india", 0.12247890295037503], ["books", 0.11738050843504047], ["ireland", 0.106725557937649], ["pearson", 0.106725557937649], ["usa", 0.09751044184428162], ["700", 0.061239451475187515], ["110", 0.061239451475187515], ["017", 0.061239451475187515], ["250", 0.061239451475187515], ["pvt", 0.061239451475187515], ["ontario", 0.061239451475187515], ["cur", 0.061239451475187515], ["auckland", 0.061239451475187515], ["m4p", 0.061239451475187515], ["hudson", 0.061239451475187515], ["3124", 0.061239451475187515], ["nz", 0.061239451475187515], ["stephen", 0.061239451475187515], ["2y3", 0.061239451475187515], ["delhi", 0.061239451475187515], ["victoria", 0.061239451475187515], ["10014", 0.061239451475187515], ["toronto", 0.061239451475187515], ["eglinton", 0.061239451475187515], ["dublin", 0.061239451475187515], ["rosedale", 0.061239451475187515], ["panchsheel", 0.061239451475187515], ["1310", 0.061239451475187515], ["375", 0.061239451475187515], ["albany", 0.0533627789688245], ["pty", 0.0533627789688245], ["roads", 0.0533627789688245], ["80", 0.0533627789688245], ["avenue", 0.0533627789688245], ["centre", 0.0533627789688245], ["orl", 0.0533627789688245], ["wc2r", 0.0533627789688245], ["90", 0.0533627789688245], ["strand", 0.0533627789688245], ["zealand", 0.0533627789688245], ["green", 0.0533627789688245], ["york", 0.05222793810132238], ["london", 0.04875522092214081], ["suite", 0.04875522092214081], ["park", 0.04875522092214081], ["england", 0.04295038428843637], ["st", 0.04295038428843637], ["11", 0.04295038428843637], ["airborne", 0.040878548415777795], ["25", 0.040878548415777795], ["east", 0.040878548415777795], ["community", 0.03760943395609846], ["road", 0.03760943395609846], ["street", 0.032092299685851866], ["2", 0.012329620870594674]], "sentiment": ["Penguin Group (USA) Inc.\n375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, USA\nPenguin Group (Canada), 90 Eglinton Avenue East, Suite 700, Toronto, Ontario M4P 2Y3, Canada\n(a division of Pearson Penguin Canada Inc )\nPenguin Books Ltd., 80 Strand, London WC2R ORL, England\nPenguin Group Ireland, 25 St. Stephen\u2019s Green, Dublin 2, Ireland (a division of Penguin Books Ltd.)\nPenguin Group (Australia), 250 Camberwell Road, Camberwell, Victoria 3124, Australia\n(a division of Pearson Australia Group Pty.

fiction writer and a failure until I was a bleeding forty-seven years of age! But first I had to be a publicity hack for General Electric in Schenectady, New York.\nWhile writing publicity releases at GE, I had a boss named George. George taped to the outside of his office door cartoons he felt had some bearing on the company or the kind of work we did. One cartoon was of two guys in the office of a buggy whip factory. A chart on the wall showed their business had dropped to zero. One guy was saying to the other, \u201cIt can\u2019t be our product\u2019s quality. We make the finest buggy whips in the world.\u201d George posted that cartoon to celebrate how GE, with its wonderful new products, was making a lot of other companies feel as though they were trying to sell buggy whips.\nA broken-down movie actor named Ronald Reagan was working for the company. He was on the road all the time, lecturing to chambers of commerce and power companies and so on about the evils of socialism. We never met, so I remain a socialist.\nWhile my future two-term president was burbling out on the rubber-chicken circuit in 1950, I started writing short stories at nights and on weekends. Jane and I had two kids by then. I needed more money than GE would pay me. I also wanted, if possible, more self-respect.\nThere was a crazy seller\u2019s market for short stories in 1950. There were four weekly magazines that published three or more of the things in every issue. Six monthlies did the same.\nI got me an agent. If I sent him a story that didn\u2019t quite work, wouldn\u2019t quite satisfy a reader, he would tell me how to fix it. Agents and editors back then could tell a writer how to fine-tune a story as though they were pit mechanics and the story were a race car. With help like that, I sold one, and then two, and then three stories, and banked more money than a year\u2019s salary at GE.\nI quit GE and started my first novel, Player Piano. It is a lampoon on GE. I bit the hand that used to feed me. The book predicted what has indeed come to pass, a day when machines, because they are so dependable and efficient and tireless, and getting cheaper all the time, are taking the halfway decent jobs from human beings.\nI moved our family of four to Cape Cod, first to Provincetown. I met Norman Mailer there. He was my age. He had been a college-educated infantry private like me, and he was already a world figure, because of his great war novel The Naked and the Dead. I admired him then, and do today. He is majestic. He is royalty. So was Jacqueline Onassis. So was Joe DiMaggio. So is Muhammad Ali. So is Arthur Miller.\nWe moved from Provincetown to Osterville, still on the Cape. But only three years after I left Schenectady, advertisers started withdrawing their money from magazines. The Buddhist catnaps coming out of my typewriter were becoming as obsolete as buggy whips.\nOne monthly that had bought several of my stories, Cosmopolitan, now survives as a harrowingly explicit sex manual.", 0.13454335016835015], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["meeting", 0.11959092915211865], ["dealer", 0.10237198183102872], ["respected", 0.08112307013174995], ["1", 0.08112307013174995], ["brink", 0.08112307013174995], ["consequence", 0.08112307013174995], ["balderdash", 0.08112307013174995], ["skinny", 0.08112307013174995], ["america", 0.07507034506177018], ["insane", 0.07045926735390465], ["mistaken", 0.07045926735390465], ["philboyd", 0.07045926735390465], ["early", 0.07045926735390465], ["studge", 0.07045926735390465], ["lonesome", 0.07045926735390465], ["dawn", 0.06422134261377903], ["beloved", 0.06422134261377903], ["anthem", 0.059795464576059325], ["tale", 0.059795464576059325], ["fast", 0.059795464576059325], ["named", 0.05658499551011079], ["fairly", 0.056362486863533026], ["citizens", 0.053557539835933726], ["pure", 0.05118599091551436], ["expected", 0.05118599091551436], ["writer", 0.049131661798214016], ["fiction", 0.049131661798214016], ["seriously", 0.049131661798214016], ["music", 0.049131661798214016], ["science", 0.049131661798214016], ["met", 0.047319615095808114], ["history", 0.04569868408568771], ["national", 0.044232373627159635], ["dying", 0.044232373627159635], ["short", 0.04289373705808841], ["light", 0.04289373705808841], ["united", 0.04166231078618785], ["states", 0.04166231078618785], ["hoover", 0.03886997352555845], ["beings", 0.03753517253088509], ["pontiac", 0.03753517253088509], ["listen", 0.03753517253088509], ["automobile", 0.032229934280243094], ["country", 0.031601903595316096], ["supposed", 0.029318518901188816], ["human", 0.025570486860300345], ["men", 0.025160206135959404], ["called", 0.02476058326821693], ["going", 0.02399119218245291], ["planet", 0.02399119218245291], ["life", 0.020633445012914167], ["white", 0.019471790358942708], ["trout", 0.016516957235976966], ["kilgore", 0.014700176077345174], ["man", 0.014496403358114088], ["dwayne", 0.014178929328963981], ["time", 0.011725231569952258]], "sentiment": ["And all music is.\n\u2014PHILBOYD STUDGE\n1\nTHIS IS A TALE of a meeting of two lonesome, skinny, fairly old white men on a planet which was dying fast.\nOne of them was a science-fiction writer named Kilgore Trout.

He didn\u2019t think the war in Iraq was going to happen, right up until it did. It broke his heart not because he gave a damn about Iraq but because he loved America and believed that the land and people of Lincoln and Twain would find a way to be right. He believed, like his immigrant forefathers, that America could be a beacon and a paradise.\nHe couldn\u2019t help thinking that all that money we were spending blowing up things and killing people so far away, making people the world over hate and fear us, would have been better spent on public education and libraries. It\u2019s hard to imagine that history won\u2019t prove him right, if it hasn\u2019t already.\nReading and writing are in themselves subversive acts. What they subvert is the notion that things have to be the way they are, that you are alone, that no one has ever felt the way you have. What occurs to people when they read Kurt is that things are much more up for grabs than they thought they were. The world is a slightly different place just because they read a damn book. Imagine that.\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that Kurt was depressed, but as with a lot of things that are common knowledge, there are good reasons to doubt it. He didn\u2019t want to be happy and he said a lot of depressing things, but I honestly don\u2019t think he was ever depressed.\nHe was like an extrovert who wanted to be an introvert, a very social guy who wanted to be a loner, a lucky person who would have preferred to be unlucky. An optimist posing as a pessimist, hoping people will take heed. It wasn\u2019t until the Iraq War and the end of his life that he became sincerely gloomy.\nThere was a bizarre, surreal incident when he took too many pills and ended up in a psych hospital, but it never felt like he was in any danger. Within a day he was bouncing around the dayroom playing Ping-Pong and making friends. It seemed like he was doing a not very convincing imitation of someone with mental illness.\nThe psychiatrist at the hospital told me, \u201cYour dad\u2019s depressed. We\u2019re going to put him on an antidepressant.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but he doesn\u2019t seem to have any of the symptoms I\u2019m used to seeing in depression. He\u2019s not slowed down, he doesn\u2019t look sad, he\u2019s still quick on the uptake.\u201d\n\u201cHe did try to kill himself,\u201d the psychiatrist said.\n\u201cWell, sort of.\u201d Of all the medications he took, there wasn\u2019t a toxic level of anything. He had a barely therapeutic level of Tylenol.", 0.11917030997676159], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
