buddy. The two of them, according to the foreword in the Song Book, would develop a sort of common-law brotherhood as a result of their having shared so much beauty, excitement, and deep emotion together.\nThe chill of the air-conditioned room made him feel dizzy. Coming out of this flicker of vertigo, Paul\u2019s eyes focused on a dinner-plate-size badge on the pillow of his bunk. \u201cDr. Paul Proteus, Wks. Mgr., Ilium, N. Y.,\u201d it said. And, below this, \u201cCall Me Paul or Pay Me $5.\u201d The second part of the legend was on every badge. The only man who was not to be called by his first name at the Meadows was the Old Man himself, the successor of Paul\u2019s father, Doctor Francis Eldgrin Gelhorne. He, National Industrial, Commercial, Communications, Foodstuffs, and Resource Director, was damn well Doctor Gelhorne, sir, at any hour of the night or day, and anywhere he went.\nAnd then Paul saw the badge on his buddy\u2019s pillow: \u201cDr. Frederick Garth, Wks. Mgr., Buffalo, N. Y. Call Me Fred or Pay Me $5.\u201d\nPaul sat down on the edge of his bed and struggled against the uneasy perplexity the sight of Garth\u2019s badge had precipitated. He had known many men, Shepherd for instance, who were forever seeing omens and worrying about them\u2014omens in a superior\u2019s handshake, in the misspelling of a name in an official document, in the seating arrangement of a banquet table, in a superior\u2019s asking for or offering a cigarette, in the tone of \u2026 Paul\u2019s career, until recent weeks, had been graceful and easy all the way, and he\u2019d found omen analysis dull, profitless. For him the omens were all good\u2014or had been until now. Now, he, too, was growing aware of possibly malevolent spooks, revealing themselves in oblique ways.\nWas it chance or ignorance or some subtle plot that had put him in the same cell with Garth, the other candidate for Pittsburgh? And why had Shepherd been made a captain, when the honor was reserved for those who were going high and far indeed? And why\u2026. Manfully, Paul turned his thoughts into other channels, superficially, at least, and managed to laugh like a man who didn\u2019t give a damn about the system any more.\nHis buddy walked in, gray at the temples, tired, pale, and kind. Fred Garth wanted desperately to be liked by everyone, and had achieved a sort of social limbo, affecting no one very much one way or the other. He had risen because of this quality rather than in spite of it. Time and time again two powerful personalities, backed by impressive factions, had aspired for the same job. And the top brass, fearing a split if they chose one faction\u2019s man over the other, had named Garth as an inoffensive compromise candidate. There was a feeling, general enough not to be branded sour grapes, that Garth was all but over his head in the big assignments compromise politics had handed him. Now, though he was only in his early fifties, he seemed terribly old\u2014willing, good-hearted, but apologetically weak, used up.\n\u201cDoctor Proteus!

"sentiment": ["There is at least one significant document by C\u00e9line that is out of print in English. And it would be punctilious of me to say that it was written not by C\u00e9line but by Dr. Destouches. It is the doctoral thesis of Destouches, \u201cThe Life and Work of Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis,\u201d for which he received a bronze medal in 1924. It was written at a time when theses in medicine could still be beautifully literary, since ignorance about diseases and the human body still required that medicine be an art.\nAnd young Destouches, in a spirit of hero-worship, told of the futile and scientifically sound battle fought by a Hungarian physician named Semmelweis (1818-1865) to prevent the spread of childbed fever in Viennese hospital maternity wards. The victims were poor people, since persons with decent sorts of dwellings much preferred to give birth at home.\nThe mortality rate in some wards was sensational\u201425 percent or more. Semmelweis reasoned that the mothers were being killed by medical students, who often came into the wards immediately after having dissected corpses riddled with disease. He was able to prove this by having the students wash their hands in soap and water before touching a woman in labor. The mortality rate dropped.\nThe jealousy and ignorance of Semmelweis\u2019s colleagues, however, caused him to be fired, and the mortality rate went up again.\nThe lesson Destouches learned from this true story, in my opinion, if he hadn\u2019t already learned it from an impoverished childhood and a stretch in the army, is that vanity rather than wisdom determines how the world is run.\n17\nA NAZI CITY MOURNED AT SOME PROFIT\nI HAVE NOT ONLY PRAISED a Nazi sympathizer, I have expressed my sorrow at the death of a Nazi city as well. I am speaking of Dresden, of course. And I have to say again that I was an American soldier, a prisoner of war there, when the city was simultaneously burned up and down. I was not on the German side.\nI mourned the destruction of Dresden because it was only temporarily a Nazi city, and had for centuries been an art treasure belonging to earthlings everywhere. It could have been that again. The same was true of Angkor Wat, which military scientists have demolished more recently for some imagined gain.\nBeing present at the destruction of Dresden has affected my character far less than the death of my mother, the adopting of my sister\u2019s children, the sudden realization that those children and my own were no longer dependent on me, the breakup of my marriage, and on and on. And I have not been encouraged to go on mourning Dresden\u2014even by Germans. Even Germans seem to think it is not worth mentioning anymore.", 0.11191756272401436], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["pal", 0.20963948880609623], ["pals", 0.07661534716336411], ["beach", 0.06749346102468572], ["hiroshima", 0.06749346102468572], ["houses", 0.06423771893907938], ["supposition", 0.04811671187336161], ["rowing", 0.04811671187336161], ["contraption", 0.04811671187336161], ["mud", 0.04811671187336161], ["neighbor", 0.04811671187336161], ["hiking", 0.04811671187336161], ["boating", 0.04811671187336161], ["disembarked", 0.04811671187336161], ["equation", 0.04811671187336161], ["promoted", 0.04811671187336161], ["accessories", 0.04811671187336161], ["unforgivable", 0.04811671187336161], ["suppertime", 0.04811671187336161], ["typically", 0.04811671187336161], ["implied", 0.04811671187336161], ["advertised", 0.041927897761219246], ["monitor", 0.041927897761219246], ["fiberglass", 0.041927897761219246], ["merchandise", 0.041927897761219246], ["burn", 0.041927897761219246], ["documentary", 0.041927897761219246], ["nanking", 0.041927897761219246], ["pressing", 0.041927897761219246], ["cumbersome", 0.041927897761219246], ["umiak", 0.041927897761219246], ["shore", 0.041927897761219246], ["worried", 0.03830767358168206], ["acted", 0.03830767358168206], ["semester", 0.03830767358168206], ["orientation", 0.03830767358168206], ["rape", 0.03830767358168206], ["junk", 0.03830767358168206], ["fishing", 0.03573908364907687], ["eating", 0.03573908364907687], ["heavily", 0.03374673051234286], ["fall", 0.03374673051234286], ["freshman", 0.03374673051234286], ["bombing", 0.03211885946953969], ["failed", 0.03211885946953969], ["sooner", 0.03211885946953969], ["team", 0.03211885946953969], ["christmas", 0.03211885946953969], ["boat", 0.03211885946953969], ["vacation", 0.03211885946953969], ["piece", 0.03211885946953969], ["ghost", 0.03211885946953969], ["decided", 0.030742514113939173], ["waiting", 0.030742514113939173], ["7", 0.030742514113939173], ["bombed", 0.029550269536934504], ["headed", 0.029550269536934504], ["peck", 0.029550269536934504], ["week", 0.029550269536934504], ["afternoon", 0.02755791640020049], ["muriel", 0.02670693265194759], ["rich", 0.02670693265194759], ["reason", 0.02670693265194759], ["social", 0.02670693265194759], ["start", 0.02670693265194759], ["moved", 0.025930045357397326], ["hiroshi", 0.024553700001796804], ["crazy", 0.024553700001796804], ["damon", 0.024553700001796804], ["late", 0.02393769222066331], ["stern", 0.023361455424792135], ["door", 0.023361455424792135], ["taught", 0.023361455424792135], ["care", 0.022309821177860147], ["death", 0.021827078130804107], ["mildred", 0.021827078130804107], ["front", 0.020933475822259625], ["guess", 0.02051811853980522], ["warden", 0.019741231245254957], ["boy", 0.019376749151324105], ["2", 0.019375118510934486], ["human", 0.019026564212455525], ["job", 0.019026564212455525], ["margaret", 0.019026564212455525], ["life", 0.017982948127546774], ["idea", 0.01774887810852094], ["best", 0.017456111833315666], ["prison", 0.016900365595110434], ["wouldn", 0.01689789436026804], ["town", 0.01689789436026804], ["break", 0.01637253275292042], ["great", 0.015180288175915756], ["work", 0.013932413690423267], ["day", 0.013187935039181739], ["lake", 0.012837750100313156], ["hadn", 0.011560063996378574], ["scipio", 0.011560063996378574], ["mother", 0.011560063996378574], ["wasn", 0.010442535934289234], ["1", 0.009217525920775975], ["years", 0.00888055870664341], ["time", 0.006563494461240871]], "sentiment": ["This was 7 years before the prison break.\nI DIDN\u2019T KNOW if Hiroshi had seen the show on his monitor or not.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1978.\nDear Mr. Singer\u2014\nJill Krementz showed me the friendly note you wrote to her. She deserves such warmth. You are right to think she is able and virtuous.\nYou are right, too, God knows, to feel that C\u00e9line was vile. I spoke to a Frenchman about C\u00e9line one time, and he said impatiently over and over, \u201cHe was base, he was base.\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever heard the word base used in conversation before in that sense. I was impressed. It was a word especially minted for the bizarre criminality of C\u00e9line. He was the one war criminal who did not wish to be forgiven or understood.\nHad I known of his criminality when I began to read him, that information would have spoiled his books. But I read Journey to the End of Night and then Death on the Installment Plan in rapid succession, and with the innocence of a lonesome soldier reading paperbacks in a bus station. I was in fact a lonesome instructor who had left his family to go to teach at the University of Iowa. There is no anti-Semitism in either book, except for a glancing reference to Jews in the League of Nations. So there was no internal evidence to warn me that he was a maniac. So I admired the books and the man.\nI mentioned him to others, and soon learned why he was detestable. I read his later books, which revealed him as base. I then read his doctoral thesis on Semmelweis, and found suggestions of greatness again.\nSo there we are. He was a rotten egg with some good parts. I think I had better shut up about him, because people are properly nauseated by such an egg. I do not feel censored or censured.

He hit me playfully on the upper arm. \u201cThere\u2014you learned something new today.\u201d\nDer Arme\nDolmetscher\nI was astonished one day in 1944, in the midst of front-line hell-raising, to learn that I had been made interpreter, Dolmetscher if you please, for a whole battalion, and was to be billeted in a Belgian burgomaster\u2019s house within artillery range of the Siegfried Line.\nIt had never entered my head that I had what it took to dolmetsch. I qualified for the position while waiting to move from France into the front lines. While a student, I had learned the first stanza of Heinrich Heine\u2019s \u201cDie Lorelei\u201d by rote from a college roommate, and I happened to give those lines a dogged rendition while working within earshot of the battalion commander. The Colonel (a hotel detective from Mobile) asked his Executive Officer (a dry-goods salesman from Knoxville) in what language the lyrics were. The Executive withheld judgment until I had bungled through \u201cDer Gipfel des Berges foo-unk-kelt im Abendsonnenschein.\u201d\n\u201cAh believes tha\u2019s Kraut, Cuhnel,\u201d he said.\nMy understanding in English of the only German I knew was this: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am so sad. I can\u2019t get an old legend out of my head. The air is cool and it\u2019s getting dark, and quiet flows the Rhine. The peak of the mountain twinkles in evening sunshine.\u201d\nThe Colonel felt his role carried with it the obligation to make quick, headstrong decisions. He made some dandies before the Wehrmacht was whipped, but the one he made that day was my favorite. \u201cIf tha\u2019s Kraut, whassat man doin\u2019 on the honey-dippin\u2019 detail?\u201d he wanted to know. Two hours later, the company clerk told me to lay down the buckets, for I was now battalion interpreter.\nOrders to move up came soon after. Those in authority were too harried to hear my declarations of incompetence. \u201cYou talk Kraut good enough foah us,\u201d said the Executive Officer. \u201cTheah ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to be much talkin\u2019 to Krauts where weah goin\u2019.\u201d He patted my rifle affectionately. \u201cHeah\u2019s what\u2019s goin\u2019 to do most of youah interpretin\u2019 fo\u2019 ya,\u201d he said. The Executive, who had learned everything he knew from the Colonel, had the idea that the American Army had just licked the Belgians, and that I was to be stationed with the burgomaster to make sure he didn\u2019t try to pull a fast one. \u201cBesides,\u201d the Executive concluded, \u201ctheah ain\u2019t nobody else can talk Kraut at all.\u201d\nI rode to the burgomaster\u2019s farm on a truck with three disgruntled Pennsylvania Dutchmen who had applied for interpreters\u2019 jobs months earlier. When I made it clear that I was no competition for them, and that I hoped to be liquidated within twenty-four hours, they warmed up enough for me to furnish the interesting information that I was a Dolmetscher. They also decoded \u201cDie Lorelei\u201d at my request. This gave me command of about forty words (par for a two-year-old), but no combination of them would get me so much as a glass of cold water.", 0.11600487634970395], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
