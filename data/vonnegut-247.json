Gelhorne would be filling any minute. It was a time for silence. The mixing, the making of new contacts, the packing up of troubles in old kit bags went on noisily across the island, in the saloon. Here in the Council House there was no joy, only the summer-cottage aroma of mildew and incipient dry rot, and a grave awareness on the part of each of the three men that the world was their apple.\nThe shouts and songs that floated over the greensward from the saloon, Paul noted, had a piping quality. There wasn\u2019t the inimitable hoarseness of an honest-to-God drunk in the lot. It was unthinkable that there was a man in the saloon without a glass in his hand, but it was also unlikely that many men would have their glasses filled more than twice. They didn\u2019t drink at the Meadows now the way they used to in the old days when Finnerty and Shepherd and Paul had joined the organization. It used to be that they\u2019d come up to the Meadows to relax and really tie one on as a relief from the terribly hard work of war production. Now the point seemed to be to pretend drunkenness, but to stay sober and discard only those inhibitions and motor skills one could safely do without.\nPaul supposed there would be a couple of men who wouldn\u2019t realize what was going on, who would earnestly try to get as drunk as everyone else seemed. They would be frightfully alone and lost when the party broke up. And there would be one or two lonely drunks with nothing to lose anyway, men who had fallen into disfavor one way or another, who knew they had received their last invitation. And what the hell, the liquor was free. De mortuis nil nisi bonum.\nThere was a voice on the porch of the Council House. Doctor Gelhorne was on the other side of the door, pausing a moment for some last word with the world outside. \u201cLook at those youngsters over there,\u201d Paul heard the Old Man say, \u201cand tell me God isn\u2019t in his heaven.\u201d\nAs the doorknob turned, Paul continued to contemplate trivia, to atomize the fixtures and conventions of the only way of life he\u2019d ever known, an easy, comfortable life, with simple answers for every doubt. That he was quitting that life, that now was perhaps the time he would do it\u2014the grand idea over-shadowing all the little ones\u2014rarely occupied his consciousness. It showed itself mainly in a sensation of being disembodied, or now and then of standing in a chilling wind. Maybe the right time to quit would come now, or a few months from now. There was no need to hurry, no need at all.\nThe door opened.\nThe three waiting men stood.\nIn came Doctor Francis Eldgrin Gelhorne, National Industrial, Commercial, Communications, Foodstuffs, and Resources Director. His spherical bulk was enclosed in a double-breasted, dark-blue suit. His single concession to the Meadows\u2019 tradition of informality was an unbuttoned collar and the sliding of his necktie knot a fraction of an inch below where it should have been. Though he was seventy, his hair was as thick and black as a twenty-year-old Mexican\u2019s. His fatness was turned into something impressive rather than comical by his perpetual I-smell-excrement expression.\nHe seemed to be the end of a race, as, Paul reflected, so many leaders seemed to be. It was hard to believe that when Gelhorne was gone there would ever be another man as wonderfully old, shrewd, and unafraid as he.\nHe cleared his throat. \u201cWe\u2019re here because somebody wants to kill us, wreck the plants, and take over the country.

His self-contempt was now at its peak.\nHe stopped working completely when he realized how profound his contempt for himself was. It was so profound that he could decide without shame to go across the street and buy a painting with soul from Lazarro. He would pay a great deal for a Lazarro painting, for the right to sign his own name to it, for Lazarro\u2019s keeping quiet about the whole shabby deal.\nHaving come to this decision, Stedman began to paint again. He painted now in an orgy of being his good old, vulgar, soulless self.\nHe created a mountain range with a dozen saber strokes. He dragged his brush above the mountains, and his brush trailed clouds behind. He shook his brush at the mountainsides, and Indians tumbled out.\nThe Indians formed at once for an attack on some poor thing in the valley. Stedman knew what the poor thing was. They were going to attack his precious cottage. He stood to paint the cottage angrily. He painted the front door ajar. He painted himself inside. \u201cThere\u2019s the essence of Stedman!\u201d he sneered. He chuckled bitterly. \u201cThere the old fool is.\u201d\nStedman went back to the trailer, made sure Cornelia was sound asleep.
