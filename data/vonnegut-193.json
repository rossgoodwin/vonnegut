I told another joke, and I sat down.\nThe party ended, as I say, with the arrival of my son and daughter-in-law and their two children, and with the playing of a phonograph recording of the closing minutes of my testimony before a congressional committee in Nineteen-hundred and Forty-nine.\nMy daughter-in-law and my grandchildren found it natural and easy, seemingly, to accord me the honors due a grandfather who, when all was said and done, was a clean and dapper and kindly old man. The model for what the children found to love in me, I suppose, was Santa Claus.\nMy son was a shock. He was such a homely and unhealthy and unhappy-looking young man. He was short like me, and nearly as fat as his poor mother had become toward the end. I still had most of my hair, but he was bald. The baldness must have been inherited from the Jewish side of his family.\nHe was a chain-smoker of unfiltered cigarettes. He coughed a lot. His suit was riddled with cigarette holes. I glanced at him while the record was playing, and I saw that he was so nervous that he had three cigarettes all going at one time.\nHe had shaken my hand with the correct wretchedness of a German general surrendering at Stalingrad, say. I was still a monster to him. He had been cajoled into coming against his better judgment\u2014by his wife and Sarah Clewes.\nToo bad.\nThe record changed nothing. The children, kept up long after their bedtime, squirmed and dozed.\nThe record was meant to honor me, to let people who might not know about it hear for themselves what an idealistic young man I had been. The part in which I accidentally betrayed Leland Clewes as a former communist was on another record, I presume. It was not played.\nOnly my very last sentences were of much interest to me.

The crowd was wonderfully drab and hampered.\nBee, who had been Unk\u2019s mate on Mars, was in Newport, too. So was Bee\u2019s and Unk\u2019s son, Chrono.\n\"Hey!\u2014getcher genuwine, authorized, official Malachis here,\" said Bee hoarsely. \"Hey!\u2014getcher Malachis here. Gotta have a Malachi to wave at the Space Wanderer,\" said Bee. \"Get a Malachi, so the Space Wanderer can bless it when he comes by.\"\nShe was in a booth facing the little iron door in the wall of the Rumfoord estate in Newport. Bee\u2019s booth was the first in the line of twenty booths that faced the door. The twenty booths were under one continuous shed roof, and were separated from one another by waist-high partitions.\nThe Malachis she was hawking were plastic dolls with movable joints and rhinestone eyes. Bee bought them from a religious supply house for twenty-seven cents apiece and sold them for three dollars. She was an excellent businesswoman.\nAnd while Bee showed the world an efficient and flashy exterior, it was the grandeur within her that sold more merchandise than anything. The carnival flash of Bee caught the pilgrims\u2019 eyes. But what brought the pilgrims to her booth and made them buy was her aura. The aura said unmistakably that Bee was meant for a far nobler station in life, that she was being an awfully good sport about being stuck where she was.\n\"Hey!\u2014getcher Malachi while there\u2019s still time,\" said Bee. \"Can\u2019t get a Malachi while a materialization\u2019s going on!\"\nThat was true. The rule was that the concessionaires had to close their shutters five minutes before Winston Niles Rumfoord and his dog materialized.

They had been buried for only a few days, but then the Government, personified by a Coroner and the Medical Examiner from the State Police who knew so much about crucifixions, ordered us to dig them up again. The Government had to fingerprint and photograph them, and describe their dental work, if any, and their obvious wounds, if any, and so on. We didn\u2019t have to dig up the Shultzes again, who had already been dug up once, to make room for the Pavilion.\nAnd we hadn\u2019t found the young woman\u2019s skull yet. The digging hadn\u2019t gone deep enough yet to find out what had become of the head of the missing Lilac Queen.\nTHE GOVERNMENT, JUST those 2 guys from out of town, said we had to bury the bodies much deeper when they were through with them. That was the law.\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to break the law,\u201d I said.\nThe Coroner was black. I wouldn\u2019t have known he was Black if he hadn\u2019t told me.\nI asked him if he couldn\u2019t arrange for the County or the State or somebody to take possession of the bodies until the next-of-kin, if any, could decide what was to be done with them. I hoped they would be taken to Rochester, where they could be embalmed or refrigerated or cremated, or at least buried in decent containers of some kind. They had been buried here in nothing but their clothing.\nHe said he would look into it, but that I shouldn\u2019t get my hopes up. He said the County was broke and the State was broke and the Country was broke and that he was broke. He had lost what little he had in Microsecond Arbitrage.\nAFTER THE GOVERNMENT left, I faced the problem of what the best way would be to dig much deeper graves. I was reluctant to ask National Guardsmen to do it with shovels. They had been resentful when I had them dig up the bodies and were growing more sullen in any case as it became more and more apparent, even that early in the game, that they might never be allowed to return to civilian life. The glamour of their Combat Infantryman\u2019s Badges was wearing thin.\nI couldn\u2019t use convict labor from across the lake. That, too, was the law. And then I remembered that the college had a backhoe which ran on diesel fuel, which wasn\u2019t a hot item on the black market. So if somebody could find the backhoe, there might still be some fuel in its tank.\nA soldier found it, and the tank was full!", 0.08722222222222224], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["0", 0.658482269882916], ["congress", 0.329241134941458], ["eisbn", 0.329241134941458], ["978", 0.329241134941458], ["catalog", 0.329241134941458], ["dialpress", 0.329241134941458], ["v3", 0.329241134941458], ["56736", 0.329241134941458], ["13024", 0.329241134941458], ["82", 0.329241134941458], ["307", 0.329241134941458], ["9", 0.2859194361564614], ["card", 0.26057786689970114], ["number", 0.22865126541432673], ["library", 0.19927603858646825]], "sentiment": ["Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 82-13024\neISBN: 978-0-307-56736-9\nwww.dialpress.com\nv3.0", 0.0], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["live", 0.1882540157551488], ["love", 0.16351261627129163], ["fell", 0.16242880518409183], ["child", 0.13893229058883946], ["strengthless", 0.09296265988967212], ["beseechingly", 0.09296265988967212], ["tastes", 0.09296265988967212], ["congratulate", 0.09296265988967212], ["crack", 0.09296265988967212], ["junk", 0.09296265988967212], ["dramatizing", 0.09296265988967212], ["gestured", 0.09296265988967212], ["gently", 0.09296265988967212], ["objects", 0.09296265988967212], ["study", 0.09296265988967212], ["foolish", 0.09296265988967212], ["chair", 0.08121440259204592], ["couch", 0.08121440259204592], ["whispered", 0.08121440259204592], ["longer", 0.08121440259204592], ["exquisitely", 0.08121440259204592], ["adore", 0.08121440259204592], ["woman", 0.07819468146246472], ["shop", 0.07434211262411095], ["shabby", 0.07434211262411095], ["literary", 0.07434211262411095], ["wept", 0.07434211262411095], ["hold", 0.06946614529441973], ["pipe", 0.06946614529441973], ["young", 0.06844274680308231], ["furnace", 0.06568405120434838], ["laid", 0.06568405120434838], ["closed", 0.06259385532648475], ["wall", 0.059981131939582065], ["picture", 0.057717887996793546], ["cried", 0.05572156535854976], ["sense", 0.05393579390672219], ["written", 0.045969630699167346], ["eyes", 0.044942094736176934], ["room", 0.04397330806092356], ["hands", 0.03981869012816111], ["man", 0.03376815470367848], ["thing", 0.03086839470103404], ["things", 0.02734908343360617], ["will", 0.026321547470615752], ["told", 0.026321547470615752], ["resi", 0.025992427371342837]], "sentiment": ["\u201cFoolish young man,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI adore that young man,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhen was it you fell in love with him?\u201d I said. \u201cAs a child?\u201d\n\u201cAs a child\u2014and then as a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they gave me all the things you\u2019d written, told me to study them, that\u2019s when I fell in love as a woman.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I can\u2019t congratulate you on your literary tastes,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou no longer believe that love is the only thing to live for?\u201d she said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThen tell me what to live for\u2014anything at all,\u201d she said beseechingly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be love.

When the typist gets back, she will find the remainder waiting for her, fully edited by me.\nI will then take off to see my boy in Jamaica.\nCheers\u2014\nKurt\nSeptember 15, 1972\nNew York City\nTO GAIL GODWIN\nGail Godwin\u2019s book was the novel Glass People.", -0.026357323232323232], "title": "Letters"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["raspberry", 0.13743896655926963], ["hiroshi", 0.09304043698349256], ["observed", 0.09304043698349256], ["understood", 0.09304043698349256], ["dried", 0.09304043698349256], ["armed", 0.09304043698349256], ["district", 0.09304043698349256], ["hustled", 0.09304043698349256], ["contained", 0.09304043698349256], ["yamashiro", 0.09304043698349256], ["arrival", 0.09304043698349256], ["boiled", 0.09304043698349256], ["tasteless", 0.09304043698349256], ["thrilled", 0.09304043698349256], ["deathly", 0.09304043698349256], ["trapezoid", 0.09304043698349256], ["swallow", 0.09304043698349256], ["ill", 0.09304043698349256], ["guts", 0.08087996013156369], ["financial", 0.08087996013156369], ["brittle", 0.08087996013156369], ["skeletons", 0.08087996013156369], ["spears", 0.08087996013156369], ["hiding", 0.08087996013156369], ["considered", 0.08087996013156369], ["captured", 0.07376653718229764], ["forced", 0.07376653718229764], ["20", 0.07376653718229764], ["treasure", 0.07376653718229764], ["family", 0.07043747515981566], ["antidote", 0.06871948327963481], ["fish", 0.0648046841337715], ["members", 0.0648046841337715], ["knives", 0.0648046841337715], ["suddenly", 0.061606060330368785], ["raspberries", 0.061606060330368785], ["medical", 0.061606060330368785], ["doctor", 0.058901662438662496], ["peanut", 0.058901662438662496], ["helicopter", 0.05655900642770596], ["small", 0.052644207281842624], ["hear", 0.050972098864222895], ["lobby", 0.049445583478439914], ["green", 0.046741185586733625], ["school", 0.046741185586733625], ["fact", 0.0443985295757771], ["dead", 0.04333493971934841], ["sort", 0.04233216052917388], ["head", 0.04138361278759009], ["die", 0.03962776263746759], ["brother", 0.03521873757990783], ["death", 0.03279504743112157], ["president", 0.031174462867419546], ["man", 0.030665909588941435], ["ho", 0.01801120682531615]], "sentiment": ["He considered himself to be already a dead man\u2014a brother to the skeletons.\nBut six members of the Raspberry family, who had observed his arrival by helicopter, suddenly came out of hiding in the lobby.
