I ask you to put this letter in the same folder, so that more honest reporters than Mr. Prescott may learn the following about me:\nI have never written with teen-agers in mind, nor are teenagers the chief readers of my books. I am the first sf writer to win a Guggenheim, the first to become a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the first to have a book become a finalist for a National Book Award. I have been on the faculties of the University of Iowa and Harvard, and was most recently a Distinguished Professor of Literature at CCNY.\nMr. Prescott is entitled to loathe everything I have ever done, which he clearly does.
