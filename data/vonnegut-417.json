he was writing.\nDear Jerome\u2014\nThe ASTP was a scheme for stockpiling college kids, with no hope of promotion or getting into OCS, until they were needed as riflemen. There was already a glut of officers and noncoms. I studied calculus and mechanics and thermodynamics and so on, for which the Army had no use, God knows, at Carnegie Tech and then the University of Tennessee. I was then assigned to the 106th Division, from which all Privates and PFC\u2019s had been stripped as overseas replacements. It still had its original officers and noncoms. I was made an Intelligence and Reconnaissance Scout, Second Battalion, 423rd Infantry, although my only basic training was on the care and feeding of a 240 mm howitzer. Fortunately, my father had been a gun nut. So practically all my fellow prisoners in the Schlachthof were college kids stockpiled in ASTP. Our own suspicion afterwards, since we had so little ammunition and were still awaiting winter equipment, and never saw an American plane or tank, and were not warned that the Germans were massing large numbers of tanks for one last major attack, is that the 106th was bait in a trap. In chess this is called a gambit. Take the exposed pawn and you\u2019ve lost the game.\nMy sister Alice early in the war married a girlhood sweetheart James C. Adams, one of the first draftees and a Second Lieutenant. He would eventually wind up a Captain in Army Public Relations in London and then Paris, although the Army had taught him to fly a spotter plane for the Field Artillery. He got home before I did, and met his son, whom I had already met. In Army PR, as you might imagine, he had met a lot of East Coast people who had been successes in civilian life in publishing of every sort, in sales promotion, as show business press agents, and on and on. So only the East Coast would do. So yes, he and his wife and kid moved to New Jersey at once, alert for opportunities for an all-purpose go-getter like himself. Indianapolis could not hold him.\nHe would become a passenger on, as far as I am able to determine, the only railroad train to go full bore off an open drawbridge. This being America, one would have thought that must have happened a hundred times.\nCheers\u2014\nKV", 0.1418081918081918], "title": "Letters"}}
