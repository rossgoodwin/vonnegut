They gave the painting the soft, holy, timeless translucence of a stained glass window. The painting, moreover, was not obviously a Lazarro. It was far better than a Lazarro, because it wasn\u2019t a picture of fear. It was a picture of beauty, pride, and vibrant affirmation.\nCornelia was radiant. \u201cYou won, honey\u2014you won,\u201d she said.\nIn a grave semicircle before the painting stood a small audience altogether different from that to which Stedman was accustomed. The serious artists had come quietly to see what Stedman had done. They were confused, rueful, and respectful\u2014for the shallow, foolish Stedman had proved that he was the master of them all. They saluted the new master with bittersweet smiles.\n\u201cAnd look at that mess over there!\u201d crowed Cornelia. She pointed across the street. In the window of Lazarro\u2019s studio was the painting Stedman had done the night before. It was signed by Lazarro.\nStedman was amazed. The painting looked nothing like a Stedman. It looked something like a postcard, all right, but like a postcard mailed from a private hell.\nThe Indians and the cottage and the old man huddled in the cottage and the mountains and the clouds didn\u2019t conspire this time for bombastic romance and prettiness. With the storytelling quality of a Brueghel, with the sweep of a Turner, with the color of a Giorgione, the painting spoke of an old man\u2019s troubled soul.\nThe painting was the priceless thing that Stedman had lost in the night. It was the only fine thing he had ever done.\nLazarro was crossing the street now, coming toward Stedman, looking wild.\nSylvia Lazarro was with him, protesting as they came. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you like this,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\n\u201cI want that picture,\u201d said Lazarro, loudly, indignantly. \u201cHow much you take for it?\u201d he snarled at Stedman. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any money now, but I\u2019ll pay you when I get some\u2014anything you want.

It seemed to Franklin that they were leaving behind all they\u2019d said, that the rising wind was whirling their dark thoughts away. By the time they had reached the firing line, Franklin was thinking only of whiskey, steak, and a red-hot stove.\nWhen he and Karl fired at the foil, Franklin ticked a corner. Karl hit it in the middle. Rudy tapped his temple, then saluted Karl with a crooked finger. Karl returned the salute.\nAfter supper, Rudy and Karl played duets for flute and clarinet. They played without sheet music, intricately and beautifully. Franklin and Merle could only keep time with their fingers, hoping that their tapping on the tabletop sounded like drums.\nFranklin glanced at his father. When their eyes met, they decided that their drumming wasn\u2019t helping. Their drumming stopped.\nWith the moment to think about, to puzzle him pleasantly, Franklin found that the music wasn\u2019t speaking anymore of just Rudy and Karl. It was speaking of all fathers and sons. It was saying what they had all been saying haltingly, sometimes with pain and sometimes with anger and sometimes with cruelty and sometimes with love: that fathers and sons were one.\nIt was saying, too, that a time for a parting in spirit was near\u2014no matter how close anyone held anyone, no matter what anyone tried.\nA Night\nfor Love", 0.08958333333333333], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
