said Peter wearily. Instantly he realized that he had said something wrong again. Borgorov\u2019s black eyebrows were raised, and Josef was glaring. He had absentmindedly violated one of Josef\u2019s basic maxims\u2014\u201cNever complain in public about anything.\u201d Peter sighed. On the battlefield he had proved a thousand times that he was a fiercely patriotic Russian. Yet, he now found his countrymen eager to read into his every word and gesture the symptoms of treason. He looked at Josef unhappily, and saw in his eyes the same old message: Grin and agree with everything.\n\u201cThe security measures are marvelous,\u201d said Peter, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that they were able to clear us in only three days, when you realize how thorough a job they do.\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cEfficiency.\u201d\n\u201cHow far down did you find the fossils?\u201d said Josef briskly, changing the subject.\nBorgorov\u2019s eyebrows were still arched. Plainly, Peter had only succeeded in making himself even more suspicious. \u201cWe hit them going through the lower part of the limestone, before we came to the sandstone and granite,\u201d he said flatly, addressing himself to Josef.\n\u201cMiddle Mesozoic period, probably,\u201d said Josef. \u201cWe were hoping you\u2019d found fossil ants deeper than that.\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong. We\u2019re delighted that you found these ants, it\u2019s only that middle Mesozoic ants aren\u2019t as interesting as something earlier would be.\u201d\n\u201cNobody\u2019s ever seen a fossil ant from an earlier period,\u201d said Peter, trying halfheartedly to get back into things. Borgorov ignored him.\n\u201cMesozoic ants are just about indistinguishable from modern ants,\u201d said Josef, surreptitiously signaling for Peter to keep his mouth shut. \u201cThey lived in big colonies, were specialized as soldiers and workers and all that. My myrmecologist would give his right arm to know how ants lived before they formed colonies\u2014how they got to be the way they are now. That would be something.\u201d\n\u201cAnother first for Russia,\u201d said Peter. Again no response. He stared moodily at a pair of live ants who pulled tirelessly and in opposite directions at the legs of an expiring dung beetle.\n\u201cHave you seen the ants we found?\u201d said Borgorov defensively. He waved a small tin box under Josef\u2019s nose. He popped off the lid with his thumbnail. \u201cIs this old stuff, eh?\u201d\n\u201cGood heavens,\u201d murmured Josef. He took the box tenderly, held it at arm\u2019s length so that Peter could see the ant embedded in the chip of limestone.", 0.03654693654693655], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["pops", 0.23584419228268466], ["jerry", 0.2301631634243675], ["disarm", 0.11923471594544902], ["resign", 0.11923471594544902], ["disarmed", 0.11923471594544902], ["sticks", 0.10416629897675454], ["striding", 0.10416629897675454], ["stunk", 0.10416629897675454], ["mess", 0.10416629897675454], ["sally", 0.10407628174488431], ["thing", 0.10388978056826272], ["leghorn", 0.09851830907054149], ["head", 0.09851830907054149], ["lost", 0.09681306067257273], ["campus", 0.09535184010483795], ["belt", 0.09535184010483795], ["bye", 0.09535184010483795], ["cop", 0.08909788200806008], ["accomplished", 0.08909788200806008], ["onstage", 0.08424693524035988], ["gang", 0.08028342313614348], ["broadway", 0.08028342313614348], ["pistol", 0.08028342313614348], ["deeply", 0.07693232140076829], ["concerned", 0.07402946503936562], ["student", 0.07402946503936562], ["exits", 0.07146896426422686], ["body", 0.06347494730498082], ["enters", 0.060364059399748794], ["going", 0.030964215716179036], ["life", 0.023703212583004698], ["good", 0.02069994435516085], ["time", 0.01341874963119723]], "sentiment": ["LEGHORN: [Striding onstage to disarm Pops] I\u2019ll take that thing.

You have caught onto something I only learned in the past month or so\u2014that terrific depressions are going to crunch me down at regular intervals, and that they have nothing to do with what is going on around me.\nOnly now do I know what the problem is. So\u2014only now can I begin to think about a partial solution. You\u2019re right\u2014a change of place makes little difference. Those awful dips still come. We inherited those regular dips. I scarcely know which ancestor to thank. People who live with us are likely to find us unpleasant and terribly self-centered when we\u2019re down. There isn\u2019t much sympathy for us when we\u2019re on an automatic down. There shouldn\u2019t be much sympathy, probably. Still\u2014\nThis is not to encourage you to have regular depressions, to be proud of the family disease. Get rid of it, if you can. I intend to try. I can at least know it for what it is, something I couldn\u2019t do before. Again\u2014I don\u2019t want you to really dig the disease, so I shouldn\u2019t tell you too much about my experiences with it. I have found, though, that I handle it best in solitude. People often find this insulting, the way we retreat. It\u2019s a way of hanging onto dignity, though. There are better ways, maybe. I\u2019ll ask a doctor what they are.\nAnother thing which is inherited in our family: an ability to draw, and it is inherited only by females. Amazing.
