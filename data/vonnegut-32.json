the roof of his mouth with the ball of his left thumb. It would come unstuck again every two minutes or so. He was left-handed, as was I until my parents made me switch, and as are my daughters Edith and Lily, or, as we call them affectionately, Edie Bucket and Lolly-boo.\n\u201cIn the beginning there was absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nothing implies something, just as up implies down and sweet implies sour, as man implies woman and drunk implies sober and happy implies sad. I hate to tell you this, friends and neighbors, but we are teensy-weensy implications in an enormous implication. If you don\u2019t like it here, why don\u2019t you go back to where you came from?\n\u201cThe first something to be implied by all the nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cwas in fact two somethings, who were God and Satan. God was male. Satan was female. They implied each other, and hence were peers in the emerging power structure, which was itself nothing but an implication. Power was implied by weakness.\u201d\n\u201cGod created the heaven and the earth,\u201d the old, long-out-of-print science fiction writer went on. \u201cAnd the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Satan could have done this herself, but she thought it was stupid, action for the sake of action. What was the point? She didn\u2019t say anything at first.\n\u201cBut Satan began to worry about God when He said, \u2018Let there be light,\u2019 and there was light. She had to wonder, \u2018What in heck does He think He\u2019s doing? How far does He intend to go, and does He expect me to help Him take care of all this crazy stuff?\u2019\n\u201cAnd then the shit really hit the fan. God made man and woman, beautiful little miniatures of Him and her, and turned them loose to see what might become of them. The Garden of Eden,\u201d said Trout, \u201cmight be considered the prototype for the Colosseum and the Roman Games.\u201d\n\u201cSatan,\u201d he said, \u201ccouldn\u2019t undo anything God had done. She could at least try to make existence for His little toys less painful. She could see what He couldn\u2019t: To be alive was to be either bored or scared stiff. So she filled an apple with all sorts of ideas that might at least relieve the boredom, such as rules for games with cards and dice, and how to fuck, and recipes for beer and wine and whiskey, and pictures of different plants that were smokable, and so on. And instructions on how to make music and sing and dance real crazy, real sexy. And how to spout blasphemy when they stubbed their toes.\n\u201cSatan had a serpent give Eve the apple.

good.\u201d\nV.\n\u201cQuite a ruckus last night, eh?\u201d called Mr. Banghart to Haley above the rattling and creaking of the empty wagon on its way to the fields. Haley sat on the rear corner of the wagon, kicking dispiritedly at the fragile white heads of milkweeds lining the lane. He did not hear Mr. Banghart\u2019s question; his senses were turned inward, examining his conscience.\nAnnie had aroused him this morning and reminded him that he and Mr. Banghart were to work today, even though it was Sunday. The radio had predicted rain, she had said, and the hay bales would be too heavy to lift and too wet to store if they were not brought in before the downpour. The General and Hope still slumbered, and Annie had returned to bed after warming coffee left over from the night before and laying out a bowl of cold cereal and an orange for Haley\u2019s breakfast. He had met Mr. Banghart in the barn and done what he could to help harness Caesar and Delores. The coffee had purged him of his sleepiness, giving him in its stead a keen, tense wakefulness.\nHe was willing to admit that he had done a bad thing in helping Kitty elope with the somewhat substandard Roy Flemming. He did, then, for his own good, as the General had said, deserve to be punished. But he searched his conscience in vain for a grain of remorse to justify the desolating punishment the General had promised. \u201cWhen you punish somebody, you take something away from them that they want,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cAll I had in the whole wide world was my music, so that\u2019s what I lost\u2014everything.\u201d\nAs he reviewed his condition again and again in the light of a spotless conscience, he found himself starting to derive from it the pungent, bittersweet pleasure of righteous indignation. Another thought, however, nagging on the fringes of his consciousness, soon came into view to spoil his pleasure. He lived again his ignominious flight from the secret room in the loft, and his abandoning of Hope, and his spirits tumbled into depths of recrimination.\nHe looked up at Mr. Banghart and wondered how he had found out about the turmoil of the night before. \u201cProbably watched it all through the windows,\u201d he thought. \u201cHope said he did a lot of that.\u201d\n\u201cHorses seem pretty frisky this morning,\u201d said Mr. Banghart, tugging gently on the reins to slow the pace of Caesar and Delores. Haley stood up and walked to Mr. Banghart\u2019s side. He saw that the corners of the horses\u2019 mouths were raw, and that every pull on the edged bits made them swing their heads wildly from side to side.\nMr. Banghart took out his hunting knife and began shaving fat splinters from a wagon stake. The cuts were effortless, Haley noted, with a youngster\u2019s admiration for a keen edge. \u201cThere\u2019s a great day coming,\u201d his companion crooned. \u201cThere are a lot of people around who are going to be wishing they had been a lot nicer to old Bing.\u201d He winked and returned the knife to its case. \u201cA man can stand so much and no more, and they\u2019re all going to have to learn that the hard way.\u201d\nHaley asked to have a look at the knife.

He broke into a run. As he loped after Mr. Banghart he told himself that he was no good to anyone; but by the time he had put the fence and barnyard between himself and the house, new strength flowed into his long legs \u2014 the quick, mad joy of liberation.\nHe overtook Mr. Banghart in a small grove of elms, a few hundred feet from the highway. They trotted together to the road\u2019s shoulder, and waved their thumbs at an approaching car. The General\u2019s voice, shouting their names, reached them as clearly as though he were riding them pick-a-back. Haley laughed aloud; the sound was no more awesome than the chatter of two red squirrels in the elms to his back.\nThe automobile, a new maroon sedan, came to a stop beside them. Mr. Banghart climbed in front, and Haley sat by himself on the broad rear seat. The driver was a husky, blond man of, Haley guessed, about forty. His chin was covered with stubble, and his eyes were red. \u201cBeen driving all night,\u201d he said. \u201cNeed somebody to keep me awake.

The sway and hum of the automobile soon lulled him to sleep.\nVI.", 0.0851969696969697], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["slovik", 0.07880544246306163], ["case",

She was too tired. She hoped that she wouldn\u2019t have to say the rest of the sentence, that Billy would finish it for her.\nBut Billy had no idea what was on her mind. \u201cHow what, Mother?\u201d he prompted.\nShe swallowed hard, shed some tears. Then she gathered energy from all over her ruined body, even from her toes and fingertips. At last she had accumulated enough to whisper this complete sentence:\n\u201cHow did I get so old?\u201d\nBilly\u2019s antique mother passed out, and Billy was led from the room by a pretty nurse. The body of an old man covered by a sheet was wheeled by just as Billy entered the corridor. The man had been a famous marathon runner in his day. So it goes. This was before Billy had his head broken in an airplane crash, by the way\u2014before he became so vocal about flying saucers and traveling in time.\nBilly sat down in a waiting room. He wasn\u2019t a widower yet. He sensed something hard under the cushion of his overstuffed chair. He dug it out, discovered that it was a book, The Execution of Private Slovik, by William Bradford Huie. It was a true account of the death before an American firing squad of Private Eddie D. Slovik, 36896415, the only American soldier to be shot for cowardice since the Civil War. So it goes.\nBilly read the opinion of a staff judge advocate who reviewed Slovik\u2019s case, which ended like this: He has directly challenged the authority of the government, and future discipline depends upon a resolute reply to this challenge. If the death penalty is ever to be imposed for desertion, it should be imposed in this case, not as a punitive measure nor as retribution, but to maintain that discipline upon which alone an army can succeed against the enemy. There was no recommendation for clemency in the case and none is here recommended. So it goes.\nBilly blinked in 1965, traveled in time to 1958.

Hiroguchis were susurruing away about *Andrew MacIntosh\u2019s being an actual maniac. This was an exaggeration. *MacIntosh was surely wild and greedy and inconsiderate, but not insane. Most of what his big brain believed to be going on was actually going on. When he flew Selena and Kazakh and the Hiroguchis from M\u00e9rida to Guayaquil in his private Learjet, with himself at the controls, he had known that the city would be under martial law, or something close to it, and that the stores would all be closed, and that there would be increasingly hungry people milling around, and that the Bah\u00eda de Darwin would not sail as scheduled, probably, and so on.\nThe communications facilities in his Yucatecan mansion had kept him absolutely up to date on what was going on in Ecuador or anyplace else he might have reason to care about. At the same time he had kept the Hiroguchis, but not his blind daughter, in the dark, so to speak, about what was likely awaiting them.\nHis true purpose in coming to Guayaquil, which, again, he had revealed to his daughter but not to the Hiroguchis, was to buy as many Ecuadorian assets as possible at rock-bottom prices, including, perhaps, even the El Dorado and the Bah\u00eda de Darwin\u2014and gold mines and oil fields, and on and on. He was moreover going to bond *Zenji Hiroguchi to himself forever by sharing these business opportunities with him, to lend him money so that he, too, could become a major property owner in Ecuador.\n*MacIntosh had told the Hiroguchis to stay in their room at the El Dorado\u2014because he would soon be bringing wonderful news for them. He had been on the telephone all afternoon, calling Ecuadorian financiers and banks, and the news he expected to bring was about all the properties he and the Hiroguchis could call their own in a day or two.\nAnd then he was going to say: \u201cAnd to hell with \u2018the Nature Cruise of the Century\u2019!\u201d\nThe Hiroguchis could no longer conceive of any good news for themselves which could be delivered by *Andrew MacIntosh. They honestly believed him to be a madman, which misconception, ironically, had been impressed upon them by *Zenji\u2019s own creation, which was Mandarax. There were now ten such instruments in the world, nine back in Tokyo, and one which *Zenji had brought along for the cruise. Mandarax, unlike Gokubi, was not only a translator, but also could diagnose with respectable accuracy one thousand of the most common diseases which attacked Homo sapiens, including twelve varieties of nervous breakdown.\nWhat Mandarax did in the medical field was simplicity itself, actually. Mandarax was programed to do what real doctors did, which was to ask a series of questions, each answer suggesting the next question, such as: \u201cHow is your appetite?\u201d and then, \u201cDo your bowels move regularly?\u201d and, perhaps, \u201cWhat did the stool look like?\u201d and so on.\nIn Yucat\u00e1n, the Hiroguchis had followed such a daisy chain of questions and answers, describing for Mandarax the behavior of *Andrew MacIntosh. Mandarax had at last displayed these words in Japanese on the screen, which was about the size of a playing card: Pathological personality.\nUnfortunately for the Hiroguchis, but not for Mandarax, which couldn\u2019t feel anything or care about anything, the computer was not programed to explain that this was a rather mild affliction compared to most, and that those who had it were rarely hospitalized, that they were, in fact, among the happiest people on the planet\u2014and that their behavior merely caused pain to those around them, and almost never to themselves. A real doctor might have gone on to say that millions of people walking the streets every day fell into a gray area, where it was difficult to say with any degree of certainty whether or not their personalities were pathological.\nBut the Hiroguchis were ignorant of medical matters, and so responded to the diagnosis as though it were a dread disease. So, one way or another, they wanted to get away from *Andrew MacIntosh, and then all the way back to Tokyo. But they remained dependent on him, as much as they wished they weren\u2019t. They had learned from the mournful-looking hotel manager, speaking to him through Mandarax, that all commercial flights out of Guayaquil had been canceled, and that none of the companies with planes for charter seemed to be answering their phones.", 0.13068910256410254], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["opportunists", 0.06003640600838624], ["cameras", 0.05215973350202322],

At least I don\u2019t think anybody did. I can\u2019t be absolutely sure about that. In the Art World, as elsewhere, opportunists are opportunists and thieves are thieves.\nBut I myself did buy from a civilian an unsigned charcoal sketch which looked like a Cezanne to me, and which has since been authenticated as such. It is now a part of the permanent collection of the Rhode Island School of Design. And I bought a Matisse, my favorite painter, from a widow who said her husband had been given it by the artist himself. For that matter, I got stuck with a fake Gauguin, which served me right.\nAnd I sent my purchases for safekeeping to just about the only person I knew and could trust in the whole United States of America anymore, Sam Wu, a Chinese laundryman in New York City who was a cook for a little while for my former master, the illustrator Dan Gregory.\nImagine fighting for a country where the only civilian you know is a Chinese laundryman!\nAnd then one day I and my platoon of artists were ordered into combat, to contain, if we could, the last big German breakthrough of World War Two.\nBut none of that stuff is in the barn, or even in my possession. I sold it all when I got home from the war, which gave me a nice little bankroll to invest in the stock market. I had given up my boyhood dream of being an artist. I enrolled in courses in accounting and economics and business law and marketing and so on at New York University. I was going to be a businessman.\nI thought this about myself and art: that I could catch the likeness of anything I could see\u2014with patience and the best instruments and materials. I had, after all, been an able apprentice under the most meticulous illustrator of this century, Dan Gregory. But cameras could do what he had done and what I could do. And I knew that it was this same thought which had sent the Impressionists and the Cubists and the Dadaists and the Surrealists and so on in their quite successful efforts to make good pictures which cameras and people like Dan Gregory could not duplicate.\nI concluded that my mind was so ordinary, which is to say empty, that I could never be anything but a reasonably good camera. So I would content myself with a more common and general sort of achievement than serious art, which was money. I was not saddened about this. I was in fact much relieved!", 0.1169855853366492], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "a-man-without-a-country": {"tfidf": [["correct", 0.3284513361245641], ["dictatorships", 0.1813174566620125], ["shut",

productive and even sociable as a young architect here in New York City.

He was to surrender to the gravitational pull of the tremendous mass of respectability which his father and mother had amassed in the American wilderness in a little more than thirty years.\nHe should have disobeyed, if he did not want constant headaches and indigestion. He should have stayed in New York City.\nHe should have moved into the very house I live in now. This house was standing back then.\nIn a huge and rich and bustling and polyglot world city like this one, he surely found many friends as gifted as himself. So he must have made all sorts of jokes here about giftedness, made romantic speeches about the pain of bringing new works of art into the world, and on and on. There was a knowing audience here for talk like that.\nWhen he got back to Indianapolis, where the practice of the arts was regarded as an evasion of real life by means of parlor tricks, the things that made him happy or sad were equally meaningless to his relatives and neighbors. So, yes, he became as silent as a clam. He died.\nWasn\u2019t it true that his wife was also gifted, that she sang beautifully? Yes, but she was not interested in creating any new music.

Nixon\u2019s special advisor on youth affairs, from Nineteen-hundred and Seventy until my arrest in Nineteen-hundred and Seventy-five, smoking four packs of unfiltered Pall Malls a day, nobody ever asked me for facts or opinions or anything. I need not even have come to work, and I might have spent my time better in helping my poor wife with the little interior-decorating business she ran out of our right little, tight little brick bungalow out in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The only visitors I ever had to my subterranean office, its walls golden-brown with cigarette tars, were the President\u2019s special burglars, whose office was above mine. They suddenly realized one day, when I had a coughing fit, that somebody was right below them, and that I might be able to hear their conversations. They performed experiments, with one of them yelling and stamping upstairs, and another one listening in my office. They satisfied themselves at last that I had heard nothing, and was a harmless old poop, in any event. The yeller and stamper was a former Central Intelligence Agency operative, a writer of spy thrillers, and a graduate of Brown University. The listener below was a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a former district attorney, and a graduate of Fordham University. I myself, as I may have said already, was a Harvard man.\nAnd this Harvard man, knowing full well that everything he wrote would be shredded and baled with all the rest of the White House wastepaper, unread, still turned out some two hundred or more weekly reports on the sayings and doings of youth, with footnotes, bibliographies, and appendices and all. But the conclusions implied by my materials changed so little over the years that I might as well have simply sent the same telegrams each week to limbo. It would have said this:\nYOUNG PEOPLE STILL REFUSE TO SEE THE OBVIOUS IMPOSSIBILITY OF WORLD DISARMAMENT AND ECONOMIC EQUALITY. COULD BE FAULT OF NEW TESTAMENT (QUOD VIDE).\nwalter f. starbuck\npresident\u2019s special advisor\non youth affairs\nAt the end of every futile day in the subbasement I would go home to the only wife I have ever had, who was Ruth\u2014waiting for me in our little brick bungalow in Chevy Chase, Maryland. She was Jewish, which I am not. So our only child, a son who is now a book reviewer for The New York Times, is half-Jewish. He has further confused racial and religious matters by marrying a black nightclub singer, who has two children by a former husband. The former husband was a nightclub comedian of Puerto Rican extraction named Jerry Cha-cha Rivera, who was shot as an innocent bystander during the robbery of a RAMJAC carwash in Hollywood. My son has adopted the children, so that they are now legally my grandchildren, my only grandchildren.\nLife goes on.\nMy late wife Ruth, the grandmother of these children, was born in Vienna. Her family owned a rarebook store there\u2014before the Nazis took it away from them. She was six years younger than I. Her father and mother and two siblings were killed in concentration camps. She herself was hidden by a Christian family, but was discovered and arrested, along with the head of that family, in Nineteen-hundred and Forty-two. So she herself was in a concentration camp near Munich, finally liberated by American troops, for the last two years of the war. She herself would die in her sleep in Nineteen-hundred and Seventy-four\u2014of congestive heart failure, two weeks before my own arrest. Whither I went, and no matter how clumsily, there did my Ruth go\u2014as long as she could. If I marveled at this out loud, she would say, \u201cWhere else could I be? What else could I do?\u201d\nShe might have been a great translator, for one thing. Languages came so easily to her, as they did not to me. I spent four years in Germany after the Second World War, but never mastered German. But there was no European language that Ruth could not speak at least a little bit. She passed the time in the concentration camp, waiting for death, by getting other prisoners to teach her languages she did not know. Thus did she become fluent in Romany, the tongue of the Gypsies, and even learned the words to some songs in Basque. She might have become a portrait artist. That was another thing she had done in prison: With a finger dipped in lampblack, she had drawn on the walls likenesses of those passing through. She might have been a famous photographer. When she was only sixteen, three years before Germany annexed Austria, she photographed one hundred beggars in Vienna, all of whom were terribly wounded veterans of World War One. These were sold in portfolios, one of which I have found recently, and to my heartbroken amazement, in the collection of New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art. She could also play the piano, whereas I am tone-deaf.

As it happened, she too had an exhibit about crystallography. She, however, had either grown her own or gathered specimens herself from creek beds and caves and coal mines within 100 kilometers of her home. Her name was Mary Alice French, I remember, and she would go on to place very close to the bottom in the National Finals in Washington, D.C.\nWhen she set off for the Finals, I heard, Cincinnati was so proud of her and so sure she would win, or at least place very high with her crystals, that the Mayor declared \u201cMary Alice French Day.\u201d\nI HAVE TO wonder now, with so much time in which to think about people I\u2019ve hurt, if Father and I didn\u2019t indirectly help set up Mary Alice French for her terrible disappointment in Washington. There is a good chance that the judges in Cleveland gave her First Prize because of the moral contrast between her exhibit and ours.\nPerhaps, during the judging, science was given a backseat, and because of our ill fame, she represented a golden opportunity to teach a rule superior to any law of science: that honesty was the best policy.\nBut who knows?\nMANY, MANY YEARS after Mary Alice French had her heart broken in Washington, and I had become a teacher at Tarkington, I had a male student from Cincinnati, Mary Alice French\u2019s hometown. His mother\u2019s side of the family had just sold Cincinnati\u2019s sole remaining daily paper and its leading TV station, and a lot of radio stations and weekly papers, too, to the Sultan of Brunei, reputedly the richest individual on Earth.\nThis student looked about 12 when he came to us. He was actually 21, but his voice had never changed, and he was only 150 centimeters tall.

Somewhere in the basement, I suppose, are racks and gibbets for insubordinate domestics.\n\u201cSomething is very wrong,\u201d said Mrs. Hellbrunner. \u201cMr. Delahanty sold that awful little cracker-box of his in one day, and for four thousand more than he paid for it. Good heavens, I\u2019m asking only a quarter of the replacement price for my house.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014it\u2019s a very special sort of person who would want your place, Mrs. Hellbrunner,\u201d I said, thinking of an escaped maniac. \u201cBut someday he\u2019ll come along. They say there\u2019s a house for every person, and a person for every house. It isn\u2019t every day I get someone in here who\u2019s looking for something in the hundred-thousand-dollar range. But sooner or later\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhen you accepted Mr. Delahanty as a client, you went right to work and earned your commission,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you do the same for me?\u201d", 0.09639724310776943], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["vernon", 0.22769385108521653], ["combat", 0.1517959007234777], ["harry", 0.11658860715734258], ["garr", 0.07589795036173885], ["employee", 0.07589795036173885], ["entitled", 0.07066736722625193], ["lesabre", 0.05592318147686413], ["changed", 0.054007535737630924], ["assault", 0.047936359623306786], ["corps", 0.047936359623306786], ["insults", 0.047936359623306786], ["schizophrenic", 0.047936359623306786], ["fewer", 0.047936359623306786], ["singled", 0.047936359623306786], ["isolated", 0.047936359623306786], ["victim", 0.047936359623306786], ["hamburg", 0.047936359623306786], ["astonishing", 0.047936359623306786], ["slightest", 0.047936359623306786], ["hadn", 0.04435974935468237], ["war", 0.04233746507995102], ["pound", 0.041635021618216375], ["army", 0.041635021618216375], ["civilian", 0.041635021618216375], ["surprised", 0.041635021618216375], ["abuse", 0.041635021618216375], ["germany", 0.041635021618216375], ["erie", 0.041635021618216375], ["charming", 0.041635021618216375], ["plutonium", 0.041635021618216375], ["mechanic", 0.041635021618216375], ["single", 0.037948975180869426], ["personality", 0.037948975180869426], ["dwayne", 0.037703062079290584], ["wife", 0.03594841259198941], ["buddy", 0.035333683613125964], ["noticed", 0.035333683613125964], ["strangers", 0.035333683613125964], ["pennsylvania", 0.035333683613125964], ["actual", 0.035333683613125964], ["francine", 0.035287182697973506], ["bomb", 0.03330510587390587], ["dropped", 0.03330510587390587], ["today", 0.031647637175779016], ["sorts", 0.031647637175779016], ["paint", 0.030246267359167574], ["brains", 0.030246267359167574], ["moved", 0.029032345608035554], ["sense", 0.029032345608035554], ["hurt", 0.029032345608035554], ["change", 0.029032345608035554], ["trouble", 0.027961590738432063], ["happened", 0.027003767868815462], ["message", 0.026137311688776147], ["believed", 0.026137311688776147], ["agency", 0.0253462991706886], ["mary", 0.0253462991706886], ["united", 0.024618638191838273], ["states", 0.024618638191838273], ["days", 0.024618638191838273], ["turn", 0.024618638191838273], ["second", 0.022731007602945143], ["listen", 0.022179874677341185], ["course", 0.021660252733341653], ["air", 0.021660252733341653], ["talk", 0.02116873253997551], ["interstate", 0.02116873253997551], ["bad", 0.01831730018674786], ["man", 0.017132113059589376], ["three", 0.016149927246338788], ["human", 0.01510983314472293], ["going", 0.014176613562358534], ["people", 0.013658381482085572], ["wanted", 0.013330336989031154], ["day", 0.013130528746133198], ["white", 0.011506057939375234], ["midland", 0.008686467682067602], ["city", 0.007875275557268123], ["time", 0.006928545927699061]], "sentiment": ["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nListen:\nHarry LeSabre said to Francine, \u201cWhen a man has been in combat with another man, he gets so he can sense the slightest change in his buddy\u2019s personality, and Dwayne has changed. You ask Vernon Garr.\u201d\nVernon Garr was a white mechanic who was the only other employee who had been with Dwayne before Dwayne moved the agency out to the Interstate. As it happened, Vernon was having trouble at home. His wife, Mary, was a schizophrenic, so Vernon hadn\u2019t noticed whether Dwayne had changed or not.

Dwayne hadn\u2019t been in combat. He was a civilian employee of the United States Army Air Corps during the Second World War, though.
