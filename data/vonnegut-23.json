"sentiment": ["Hooray for firemen.\n3\nIn Timequake One, Kilgore Trout wrote a story about an atom bomb. Because of the timequake, he had to write it twice. The ten-year rerun following the timequake, remember, made him and me, and you, and everybody else, do everything we\u2019d done from February 17th, 1991, to February 13th, 2001, a second time.\nTrout didn\u2019t mind writing it again. Rerun or not, he could tune out the crock of shit being alive was as long as he was scribbling, head down, with a ballpoint pen on a yellow legal pad.\nHe called the story \u201cNo Laughing Matter.\u201d He threw it away before anybody else could see it, and then had to throw it away again during the rerun. At the clambake at the end of Timequake One, in the summer of the year 2001, after free will kicked in again, Trout said this about all the stories he had torn to pieces and flushed down toilets, or tossed into trash-strewn vacant lots, or whatever: \u201cEasy come, easy go.\u201d\n\u201cNo Laughing Matter\u201d got its title from what a judge in the story said during a top-secret court-martial of the crew of the American bomber Joy\u2019s Pride, on the Pacific island of Banalulu, one month after the end of World War Two.\nJoy\u2019s Pride itself was perfectly OK, and in a hangar there on Banalulu. It was named in honor of the pilot\u2019s mother, Joy Peterson, a nurse in obstetrics in a hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas. Pride had a double meaning. It meant self-respect. It meant a lion family, too.\nHere\u2019s the thing: After an atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and then another one was dropped on Nagasaki, Joy\u2019s Pride was ordered to drop yet another one on Yokohama, on a couple of million \u201clittle yellow bastards.\u201d The little yellow bastards were called \u201clittle yellow bastards\u201d back then. It was wartime. Trout described the third atom bomb like this: \u201cA purple motherfucker as big as a boiler in the basement of a mid-size junior high school.\u201d\nIt was too big to fit inside the bomb bay.

The infrastructure of the Serb tyranny should have been left unharmed in order to support justice and sanity, should they return. All cities and even little towns are world assets. For NATO to make one unliveable is to cut off its nose to spite its face, so to speak.\nShow business!\nThe homicidal paranoia and schizophrenia of ethnic cleansing does its worst quickly now, almost instantly, like a tidal wave or volcano or earthquake\u2014in Rwanda and now Kosovo, and who knows where else? The disease used to take years. One thinks of the Europeans killing off the Aborigines in the Western Hemisphere, and in Australia and Tasmania, and the Turks\u2019 elimination of Armenians from their midst\u2014of course the Holocaust, which groundon and on from 1933 to 1945. The Tasmanian genocide, incidentally, is the only one of which I\u2019ve heard which was one-hundred-percent successful. Nobody on the face of the Earth has a native Tasmanian as a forebear!\nAs is now the case with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, there is a new strain of the ethnic-cleansing bacterium that makes conceivable remedies of the past seem pathetic or even absurd. In every case nowadays: too late! The victims are practically all dead or homeless by the time they are first mentioned on the six o\u2019clock news.\nAll that good people can do about the disease of ethnic cleansing, now always a fait accompli, is to rescue the survivors. And watch out for Christians!\nThis is Kurt Vonnegut, signing off.\nmy career in post-mortem journalism,\ndear listeners, almost certainly ends today. No sooner had Jack Kervorkian unstrapped me from my gurney, and I sat up and prepared to tell of my interview in Heaven with the late Isaac Asimov, than Jack was hustled out of here in handcuffs\u2014to answer a murder charge in Michigan. Irony of ironies! This purported murderer has saved my life more than a dozen times! With Jack gone, this lethal-injection facility no longer feels like a home away from home to me.\nForgive my mixed emotions, then, as I mourn the misery of one friend, Jack, who is still alive, while rejoicing in the relative well-being of another\u2014Isaac Asimov, who died of kidney and heart failure, age seventy-two, eight years ago.\nWhen on Earth, Isaac, my predecessor as honorary president of the American Humanist Association, was the most prolific American writer of books who ever lived. He wrote nearly five hundred of the things\u2014to my measly twenty so far, or to Honor\u00e9 de Balzac\u2019s eighty-five. Sometimes Isaac wrote ten published volumes in a single year!

His back was to the doorway, and he twisted around in his chair to see what it was behind him that was distracting his audience. Kitty stood in the doorway. \u201cHello, dear,\u201d he said to her, in a kindly tone. \u201cI hope you\u2019ve gotten over any ill feelings you may have had against your old father.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to marry him, and that\u2019s that.\u201d\nThe General shrugged. He took her hand and gave it an affectionate squeeze. \u201cWhat do you want to do\u2014mother a race of super-idiots? He can\u2019t concentrate on anything but his motorcycle for more than twenty seconds at a time. If you two were married and down to your last five dollars, he\u2019d blow it on two foxtails and a chromium-plated exhaust-pipe extension. If it came to a choice between you or the motorcycle, sister, you\u2019d lose.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d declared Kitty. \u201cHe knows more about motors than anybody. And, while we\u2019re getting mean about it, what about you? You\u2019re as much in love with that German limousine of yours as Roy is with his motorcycle.\u201d\nHaley saw that this rankled the General a little. \u201cThat car,\u201d he said crisply, \u201cis the only one of its kind in the world. It couldn\u2019t be replaced for thirty thousand dollars. Moreover, young lady, I do have other interests. Take away Roy\u2019s motorcycle, and he\u2019d vanish. I could build a better man with an Erector set.\u201d\nKitty turned white with fury. \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant, and he\u2019s good looking, and he\u2019s a gentleman, and he\u2019s considerate, and he\u2019s from a good family, and he\u2019s\u2014\u201d", 0.13141534391534393], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["roy", 0.05692462059423561], ["pieces", 0.048060048753786444], ["ladder", 0.04601307240685394], ["hit", 0.03970887790366662], ["luggage", 0.0348237561192309], ["caught", 0.0348237561192309], ["leaned", 0.03135770705354679], ["find", 0.02461534816275857], ["speed", 0.024030024376893222], ["spite", 0.024030024376893222], ["hated", 0.024030024376893222], ["difficulties", 0.024030024376893222], ["spiriting", 0.024030024376893222], ["dandy", 0.024030024376893222], ["colorful", 0.024030024376893222], ["stung", 0.024030024376893222], ["delighted", 0.024030024376893222], ["cushion", 0.024030024376893222], ["mollified", 0.024030024376893222], ["chastened", 0.024030024376893222], ["large", 0.024030024376893222], ["depressed", 0.024030024376893222], ["token", 0.024030024376893222], ["bled", 0.024030024376893222], ["desperate", 0.024030024376893222], ["blues", 0.024030024376893222], ["blacks", 0.024030024376893222], ["inherent", 0.024030024376893222], ["retribution", 0.024030024376893222], ["windowsill", 0.024030024376893222], ["smartly", 0.024030024376893222], ["lamely", 0.024030024376893222], ["planned", 0.024030024376893222], ["clapboard", 0.024030024376893222], ["perused", 0.024030024376893222], ["furtively", 0.024030024376893222], ["leverage", 0.024030024376893222], ["sections", 0.024030024376893222], ["popped", 0.024030024376893222], ["querulousness", 0.024030024376893222], ["vindication", 0.024030024376893222], ["ha", 0.024030024376893222], ["thumps", 0.024030024376893222], ["siding", 0.024030024376893222], ["venture", 0.024030024376893222], ["brightly", 0.024030024376893222], ["covers", 0.024030024376893222], ["mouse", 0.024030024376893222], ["florid", 0.024030024376893222], ["occasional", 0.024030024376893222], ["toothed", 0.024030024376893222], ["nuptial", 0.024030024376893222], ["thundering", 0.024030024376893222], ["struggling", 0.024030024376893222], ["appealed", 0.024030024376893222], ["complacent", 0.024030024376893222], ["dummy", 0.024030024376893222], ["happier", 0.024030024376893222], ["tall", 0.024030024376893222], ["amazed", 0.024030024376893222], ["house", 0.02198304802996072], ["whack", 0.01985443895183331], ["jerked", 0.01985443895183331], ["patch", 0.01985443895183331], ["served", 0.01985443895183331], ["weight", 0.01985443895183331], ["threatened", 0.01985443895183331], ["terribly", 0.01985443895183331], ["perspiring", 0.01985443895183331], ["horse", 0.01985443895183331], ["staring", 0.01985443895183331], ["staggering", 0.01985443895183331], ["grief", 0.01985443895183331], ["upright", 0.01985443895183331], ["stall", 0.01985443895183331], ["shoulders", 0.01985443895183331], ["separate", 0.01985443895183331], ["baggage", 0.01985443895183331], ["mechanical", 0.01985443895183331], ["counted", 0.01985443895183331], ["bedroom", 0.01741187805961545], ["lighted", 0.01741187805961545], ["silent", 0.01741187805961545], ["slipped", 0.01741187805961545], ["angrily", 0.01741187805961545], ["solid", 0.01741187805961545], ["yelled", 0.01741187805961545], ["window", 0.016264177312638746], ["paper", 0.015678853526773395], ["evening", 0.015678853526773395], ["guessed", 0.015678853526773395], ["idea", 0.015678853526773395], ["objected", 0.015678853526773395], ["3", 0.015678853526773395], ["kicked", 0.015678853526773395], ["gathered", 0.015678853526773395], ["carry", 0.015678853526773395], ["expected", 0.015678853526773395], ["threw", 0.015678853526773395], ["huh", 0.015678853526773395], ["fell", 0.015678853526773395], ["ears", 0.014334615265844423], ["carried", 0.014334615265844423], ["caesar", 0.014334615265844423], ["hand", 0.01323629263455554], ["motorcycle", 0.01323629263455554], ["returned", 0.01323629263455554], ["whispered", 0.01323629263455554], ["suddenly", 0.01323629263455554], ["knew", 0.01323629263455554], ["beneath", 0.012307674081379285], ["second", 0.012307674081379285], ["won", 0.012307674081379285], ["making", 0.012307674081379285], ["bits", 0.011503268101713485], ["moving", 0.011503268101713485], ["love", 0.010793731742337682], ["morning", 0.010159029840784511], ["bed", 0.010159029840784511], ["cried", 0.009584872131119903], ["kitty", 0.008805873596901114], ["stood", 0.008578522223510469], ["will", 0.008578522223510469], ["side", 0.007327682676653574], ["sunroom", 0.007327682676653574], ["door", 0.0059834444157246], ["room", 0.0059834444157246], ["annie", 0.005933451627684266], ["hope", 0.005488769418571373], ["head", 0.0051415050038260525], ["eyes", 0.004402936798450557], ["good", 0.004175585425059912], ["general", 0.0032949678938666493], ["haley", 0.0015914596137345165]], "sentiment": ["\u201cGood grief!

The solid thumps carried to the ears of Haley, who threw back his covers and ran to the window. In the silent patch of blues and blacks below him, he saw Roy, moving toward the house, staggering beneath the weight of a tall ladder. Roy stood the ladder upright, and leaned it in toward Haley\u2019s windowsill. The ladder gathered speed as it fell toward the house, and Roy was without leverage to stop it as it threatened to hit the clapboard siding with a thundering whack. Haley leaned out and caught the ladder just before it hit, and his hand served as a cushion between it and the house. In spite of himself he cried out, and jerked his hand, which stung smartly and bled.\nRoy popped his colorful head into the window, and Hope and Kitty slipped through the bedroom door, looking furtively over their shoulders, and struggling with several large pieces of luggage.\n\u201cWho yelled?\u201d whispered Hope angrily.\nHaley appealed with his eyes to Roy for vindication, but Roy, florid and perspiring, was staring amazed at the baggage Kitty expected to carry away on the nuptial motorcycle. Haley guessed, from what little he knew of Roy, that the idea of spiriting his love away had delighted him, but that the mechanical difficulties inherent in the desperate venture now depressed him terribly.

She had the afternoon paper with her, the one in which Billy described his friends from Tralfamadore.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you,\u201d said Billy.\nThe orchestration of the moment was this: Barbara was only twenty-one years old, but she thought her father was senile, even though he was only forty-six\u2014senile because of damage to his brain in the airplane crash. She also thought that she was head of the family, since she had had to manage her mother\u2019s funeral, since she had to get a housekeeper for Billy, and all that. Also, Barbara and her husband were having to look after Billy\u2019s business interests, which were considerable, since Billy didn\u2019t seem to give a damn for business any more. All this responsibility at such an early age made her a bitchy flibbertigibbet. And Billy, meanwhile, was trying to hang onto his dignity, to persuade Barbara and everybody else that he was far from senile, that, on the contrary, he was devoting himself to a calling much higher than mere business.\nHe was doing nothing less now, he thought, than prescribing corrective lenses for Earthling souls. So many of those souls were lost and wretched, Billy believed, because they could not see as well as his little green friends on Tralfamadore.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Father,\u201d said Barbara. \u201cI know perfectly well you heard me when I called.\u201d This was a fairly pretty girl, except that she had legs like an Edwardian grand piano. Now she raised hell with him about the letter in the paper. She said he was making a laughing stock of himself and everybody associated with him.\n\u201cFather, Father, Father\u2014\u201d said Barbara, \u201cwhat are we going to do with you? Are you going to force us to put you where your mother is?\u201d Billy\u2019s mother was still alive.

"sentiment": ["Somewhere along the line of evolution, the ancestors of such a bird must have begun to doubt the value of their wings, just as, in 1986, human beings were beginning to question seriously the desirability of big brains.\nIf Darwin was right about the Law of Natural Selection, cormorants with small wings, just shoving off from shore like fishing boats, must have caught more fish than the greatest of their aviators. So they mated with each other, and those children of theirs who had the smallest wings became evern better fisherpeople, and so on.\nNow the very same sort of thing has happened to people, but not with respect to their wings, of course, since they never had wings\u2014but with respect to their hands and brains instead. And people don\u2019t have to wait any more for fish to nibble on baited hooks or blunder into nets or whatever. A person who wants a fish nowadays just goes after one like a shark in the deep blue sea.\nIt\u2019s so easy now.\n8\nEVEN BACK IN JANUARY, there were any number of reasons Roy Hepburn should not have signed up for that cruise. It wasn\u2019t evident then that a world economic crisis was coming, and that the people of Ecuador would be starving when the ship was supposed to sail. But there was the matter of Mary\u2019s job. She did not yet know that she was about to be laid off, to be forced into early retirement, so she could not see how she, in good conscience, could take off three weeks in late November and early December, right in the middle of a semester.\nAlso, although she had never been there, she had grown very bored with the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago. There was such a wealth of films and slides and books and articles about the islands, which she had used over and over in her courses, that she could not imagine any surprise that might await her there.

Whenever she told the story, she was emphatic about that: she hadn\u2019t fished anything from the woman\u2019s mouth. Whatever had stayed in there was still the woman\u2019s very personal property.\nAnd Mother crawled away after nightfall, after the killers had all gone home. She wasn\u2019t from my father\u2019s village, and she would not meet him until they both crossed the lightly guarded border with Persia, about seventy miles from the scene of the massacre.\nPersian Armenians took them in. After they decided to go together to Egypt. My father did most of the talking, since Mother had a mouthful of jewels. When they got to the Persian Gulf, mother sold the first of those compact treasures in order to buy them passage on a small freighter to Cairo, via the Red Sea. And it was in Cairo that they met the criminal Vartan Mamigonian, a survivor of an earlier massacre.\n\u201cNever trust a survivor,\u201d my father used to warn me, with Vartan Mamigonian in mind, \u201cuntil you find out what he did to stay alive.\u201d\nThis Mamigonian had grown rich manufacturing military boots for the British Army and the German Army, which would soon be fighting each other in World War One. He offered my parents low-paid work of the dirtiest kind. They were fools enough to tell him, since he was a fellow Armenian survivor, about Mother\u2019s jewels and their plans to marry and go to Paris to join the large and highly cultivated Armenian colony

every one of you an extended family, make you an Ibo or a Navaho\u2014or a Kennedy.\nNow, you take George and Laura Bush, who imagine themselves as a brave, clean-cut little couple. They are surrounded by an enormous extended family, what we should all have\u2014I mean judges, senators, newspaper editors, lawyers, bankers. They are not alone. That they are members of an extended family is one reason they are so comfortable. And I would really, over the long run, hope America would find some way to provide all of our citizens with extended families\u2014a large group of people they could call on for help.\nI am a German-American, a pure one dating back to when German-Americans were still endogamous, marrying each other. When I asked the Anglo-American Jane Marie Cox to marry me in 1945, one of her uncles asked her if she really \u201cwanted to get mixed up with all those Germans.\u201d Yes, and even today there is a sort of San Andreas fault line running between German-Americans and Anglos, but fainter all the time.\nYou might think this was because of the First World War, in which the English and the Americans fought Germany, during which the fault opened as wide and deep as a mouth of hell, although no German-American had performed an act of treason. But the crack first appeared around the time of the Civil War, when all my immigrant ancestors got here and settled in Indianapolis. One ancestor actually lost a leg in battle and went back to Germany, but the rest stayed and prospered like crazy.\nThey arrived at a time when the Anglo ruling class, like our polyglot corporate oligarchs of today, wanted the cheapest and tamest workers they could find anywhere in the whole wide world. The specifications for such persons, then as now, were those listed by Emma Lazarus in 1883: \u201ctired,\u201d \u201cpoor,\u201d \u201chuddled,\u201d \u201cwretched,\u201d \u201chomeless,\u201d and \u201ctempest-tost.\u201d And people like that had to be imported back then. Jobs couldn\u2019t, as today, be sent to them right where they were so unhappy. Yes, and they were coming here any way they could, by the tens of thousands.\nBut in the midst of this tidal wave of misery was what would in retrospect seem to the Anglos a Trojan horse, one filled with educated, well-fed, middle-class German businessmen and their families, who had money to invest. One ancestor on my mother\u2019s side became a brewer in Indianapolis. But he didn\u2019t build a brewery. He bought one! How was that for pioneering? Nor had these people had to play any part in the genocides and ethnic cleansing which had made this for them a virgin continent.\nAnd these guilt-free people, speaking English at work but German at home, built not only successful businesses, most strikingly in Indianapolis and Milwaukee and Chicago and Cincinnati, but their own banks and concert halls and social clubs and gymnasia and restaurants, and mansions and summer cottages, leaving the Anglos to wonder, with good reason, I have to say, \u201cWho the hell\u2019s country is this anyway?\u201d\n6\nI have been called a

has had several strong drinks. He goes on to say that it was Wilson who persuaded this country that it was patriotic to be stupid, to be proud of knowing only one language, of believing that all other cultures were inferior and ridiculous, offensive to God and common sense alike, that artists and teachers and studious persons in general were ninnies when it came to dealing with problems in life that really mattered, and on and on.\nThis friend says that it was a particular misfortune for this country that the German-Americans had achieved such eminence in the arts and education when it was their turn to be scorned from on high. To hate all they did and stood for at that time, which included gymnastics, by the way, was to lobotomize not only the German-Americans but our culture.\n\u201cThat left American football,\u201d says my German-American friend, and someone is elected to drive him home.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTo return to Uncle John:\n\u201cAll of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.\u2019s eight great-grandparents were part of the vast migration of Germans to the Midwest in the half century from 1820 to 1870. They were: Clemens Vonnegut, Sr., and his wife, Katarina Blank; Henry Schnull and his wife, Matilde Schramm; Peter Lieber and his wife, Sophia St. Andr\u00e9; Karl Barus and his wife, Alice M\u00f6llman. They were preceded only by four of his sixteen great-great-grandparents, who were Jacob Schramm and his wife, Julia Junghans; and Johann Blank and his wife, Anna Maria Oger. The remaining twelve and their forebears are mostly unknown. They never left Germany. Their bones still repose there in anonymity.\n\u201cBut all of the eight ancestors who did settle here were better educated and of higher social rank than the mine-run of immigrants. They were with the exception of Anna Oger\u2019s parents, burghers, city people, merchants and members of the upper middle class, in contrast to the bulk of German immigrants who were chiefly peasant farmers or skilled artisans.\n\u201cThus, K\u2019s great-great-grandfather Jacob Schramm came from Saxony, where for generations his family had been grain merchants. He brought with him five thousand dollars in gold, six hundred books, and boxes of household goods, including a dinner set of Meissen porcelain. He bought at once a section of land near Cumberland, Indiana. He was a highly literate fellow, and wrote a series of letters back to Germany detailing his experiences and making valuable suggestions for the guidance of subsequent immigrants. These letters were printed and published in Germany. A copy of this publication is in the library of the Indiana Historical Society, which issued an English translation of it in 1928. Jacob Schramm traveled extensively\u2014once around the world, quite by himself. He prospered. He bought a great deal of land, one parcel of over two thousand acres on the old Michigan Road just northwest of Indianapolis. He loaned money, secured by good mortgages, to later arrivals in the vicinity. When his only daughter, Matilda, married Henry Schnull in 1857, Jacob Schramm advanced the latter capital to help him start a wholesale grocery business and launch a successful mercantile career which made him a large fortune.\n\u201cK\u2019s paternal ancestors the Vonneguts, were likewise people of substance.

And it is their satisfied opinion that, as Mr. Z had hoped, she is certainly happy.\nPrognosis: Another breakdown by-and-by.\nAs for Mr. Z: He is certainly sick too, since he certainly isn't like any other man I ever knew. He will not leave Hometown, except for very short trips as far as Indianapolis and no farther. I suspect that he cannot leave Hometown. Why not?\nTo be utterly unscientific, and science becomes nauseating to a therapist after a case such as this: His Destination is there.\nThe good doctor's prognosis was correct. Sylvia became a popular and influential member of the international Jet Set, learned the many variations of the Twist. She became known as the Duchess of Rosewater. Many men proposed, but she was too happy to think of either marriage or divorce. And then she fell to pieces again in July of 1964.\nShe was treated in Switzerland. She was discharged six months later, silent and sad, almost unbearably deep again. Eliot and the pitiful people of Rosewater County again had a place in her consciousness. She wished to return to them, not out of yearning but out of a sense of duty. Her doctor warned her that a return might be fatal. He told her to remain in Europe, to divorce Eliot, and to build a quiet, meaningful life of her own.\nSo, very civilized divorce proceedings were begun, stage-managed by McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee.\nNow it was time for Sylvia to fly to America for the divorce. And a meeting was held on a June evening in the Washington, D.C., apartment of Eliot's father, Senator Lister Ames Rosewater. Eliot was not there. He would not leave Rosewater County. Present were the Senator, Sylvia, Thurmond McAllister, the ancient lawyer, and his watchful young aide, Mushari.\nThe tone of the meeting was frank, sentimental, forgiving, sometimes hilarious, and fundamentally tragic always.

Not only were his lungs emptied of air, but his romantic vision was destroyed. What was about to happen below, he realized, was not majestic. It would be insane. There was no such thing as magic, and yet his father and his brother and the governor, and probably even President Grover Cleveland, expected this police chief to become a wizard, a Merlin\u2014to make a crowd vanish with a magic spell.\n\u201cIt will not work,\u201d he thought. \u201cIt cannot work.\u201d\nIt did not work.\nThe chief cast his spell. His shouted words bounced off the buildings, warred with their own echoes, and sounded like Babylonian by the time they reached Alexander\u2019s ears.\nAbsolutely nothing happened.\nThe chief climbed down from the scaffold. His manner indicated that he had not expected much of anything to happen, that there were simply too many people out there. It was with great modesty that he rejoined his own shock troops, who were armed with shields and lances, but safe inside the fence. He was not about to ask them to arrest anyone, or to do anything provocative against a crowd so large.\nBut Colonel Redfield was enraged. He had the gate opened a crack, to let him out so he could join his half-frozen troops. He took his place between two farm boys at the center of the long line. He ordered his men to level their bayonets at those in front of them. Next, he ordered them to take one step forward. This they did.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLooking down on the plaza, young Alexander could see the people at the front of the crowd backing into those behind them as they shrank from the naked steel. People at the back of the crowd, meanwhile, had no idea what was going on, and were not about to depart, to relieve the pressure some.\nThe soldiers advanced yet another pace and the people retreating put pressure not only on those behind them, but on those beside them, too. Those at either end found themselves squashed against the buildings. The soldiers facing them had no heart for skewering someone so hopelessly immobilized, so they averted their bayonets, opening a space between the blade tips and the unyielding walls.",

outside my father\u2019s study door in Ilium, New York. The door was open, and I could see my father. He was wearing pajamas and a bathrobe. He was smoking a cigar. He was playing with a loop of string. Father was staying home from the laboratory in his pajamas all day that day. He stayed home whenever he wanted to.\n\u201cFather, as you probably know, spent practically his whole professional life working for the Research Laboratory of the General Forge and Foundry Company in Ilium. When the Manhattan Project came along, the bomb project, Father wouldn\u2019t leave Ilium to work on it. He said he wouldn\u2019t work on it at all unless they let him work where he wanted to work. A lot of the time that meant at home. The only place he liked to go, outside of Ilium, was our cottage on Cape Cod. Cape Cod was where he died. He died on a Christmas Eve. You probably know that, too.\n\u201cAnyway, I was playing on the carpet outside his study on the day of the bomb. My sister Angela tells me I used to play with little toy trucks for hours, making motor sounds, going \u2018burton, burton, burton\u2019 all the time. So I guess I was going \u2018burton, burton, burton\u2019 on the day of the bomb; and Father was in his study, playing with a loop of string.\n\u201cIt so happens I know where the string he was playing with came from. Maybe you can use it somewhere in your book. Father took the string from around the manuscript of a novel that a man in prison had sent him. The novel was about the end of the world in the year 2000, and the name of the book was 2000 A.D. It told about how mad scientists made a terrific bomb that wiped out the whole world. There was a big sex orgy when everybody knew that the world was going to end, and then Jesus Christ Himself appeared ten seconds before the bomb went off. The name of the author was Marvin Sharpe Holderness, and he told Father in a covering letter that he was in prison for killing his own brother. He sent the manuscript to Father because he couldn\u2019t figure out what kind of explosives to put in the bomb. He thought maybe Father could make suggestions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to tell you I read the book when I was six. We had it around the house for years. My brother Frank made it his personal property, on account of the dirty parts. Frank kept it hidden in what he called his \u2018wall safe\u2019 in his bedroom. Actually, it wasn\u2019t a safe but just an old stove flue with a tin lid. Frank and I must have read the orgy part a thousand times when we were kids. We had it for years, and then my sister Angela found it. She read it and said it was nothing but a piece of dirty rotten filth. She burned it up, and the string with it. She was a mother to Frank and me, because our real mother died when I was born.\n\u201cMy father never read the book, I\u2019m pretty sure. I don\u2019t think he ever read a novel or even a short story in his whole life, or at least not since he was a little boy. He didn\u2019t read his mail or magazines or newspapers, either. I suppose he read a lot of technical journals, but to tell you the truth, I can\u2019t remember my father reading anything.\n\u201cAs I say, all he wanted from that manuscript was the string. That was the way he was. Nobody could predict what he was going to be interested in next. On the day of the bomb it was string.\n\u201cHave you ever read the speech he made when he accepted the Nobel Prize? This is the whole speech: \u2018Ladies and Gentlemen. I stand before you now because I never stopped dawdling like an eight-year-old on a spring morning on his way to school. Anything can make me stop and look and wonder, and sometimes learn. I am a very happy man. Thank you.\u2019\n\u201cAnyway, Father looked at that loop of string for a while, and then his fingers started playing with it. His fingers made the string figure called a \u2018cat\u2019s cradle.\u2019 I don\u2019t know where Father learned how to do that. From his father, maybe. His father was a tailor, you know, so there must have been thread and string around all the time when Father was a boy.\n\u201cMaking that cat\u2019s cradle was the closest I ever saw my father come to playing what anybody else would call a game. He had no use at all for tricks and games and rules that other people made up. In a scrap-book my sister Angela used to keep up, there was a clipping from Time magazine where somebody asked Father what games he played for relaxation, and he said, \u2018Why should I bother with made-up games when there are so many real ones going on?\u2019", 0.06470225510923186], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["pistol", 0.06922031597729088], ["tissues",

it is the same with Takaru everywhere since the war.\u201d\n\u201cNo Takaru,\u201d said Halyard apathetically, and let it go.\n\u201cSumklish,\u201d sighed the Shah.\nKhashdrahr handed him the flask of sacred liquor.\n3\nDOCTOR PAUL PROTEUS, the man with the highest income in Ilium, drove his cheap and old Plymouth across the bridge to Homestead. He had had the car at the time of the riots, and among the bits of junk in the glove compartment\u2014match cards, registration, flashlight, and face tissues\u2014was the rusty pistol he had been issued then. Having a pistol where some unauthorized person might get at it was very much against the law. Even members of the huge standing army did without firearms until they\u2019d disembarked for occupation duty overseas. Only the police and plant guards were armed. Paul didn\u2019t want the pistol but was forever forgetting to turn it in. Over the years, as it had accumulated a patina of rust, he\u2019d come to regard it as a harmless antique. The glove compartment wouldn\u2019t lock, so Paul covered the pistol with tissues.\nThe engine wasn\u2019t working properly, now and then hesitating, catching again, slowing suddenly, catching again. His other cars, a new station wagon and a very expensive sedan, were at home, as he put it, for Anita. Neither of the good cars had ever been in Homestead, and neither had Anita for many years. Anita never needled him about his devotion to the old car, though she did seem to think some sort of explanation to others was in order. He had overheard her telling visitors that he had had it rebuilt in such a way that it was far better mechanically than what was coming off the automatic assembly lines at Detroit\u2014which simply wasn\u2019t true. Nor was it logical that a man with so special a car would put off and put off having the broken left headlamp fixed. And he wondered how she might have explained, had she known, that he kept a leather jacket in the trunk, and that he exchanged his coat for this and took off his necktie before crossing the Iroquois. It was a trip he made only when he had to\u2014for, say, a bottle of Irish whisky for one of the few persons he had ever felt close to.\nHe came to a stop at the Homestead end of the bridge. About forty men, leaning on crowbars, picks, and shovels, blocked the way, smoking, talking, milling about something in the middle of the pavement. They looked around at Paul with an air of sheepishness and, as though there were nothing but time in the world, they moved slowly to the sides of the bridge, leaving an alley barely wide enough for Paul\u2019s car. As they separated, Paul saw what it was they had been standing around.

They probably would have been melted up and made back into weapons during World War I.\nIF HENRY MOELLENKAMP had not come out of his mother\u2019s womb dyslexic, these heights above Scipio might have been all darkness on the cold winter night 2 years ago, with Lake Mohiga frozen hard as a parking lot, when 10,000 prisoners at Athena were suddenly set free.\nInstead, there was a little galaxy of beckoning lights up here.\n4\nREGARDLESS OF WHETHER Henry Moellenkamp came out of his mother\u2019s womb dyslexic or not, I was born in Wilmington, Delaware, 18 months before this country joined the fighting in World War II. I have not seen Wilmington since. That is where they keep my birth certificate. I was the only child of a housewife and, as I\u2019ve said, a chemical engineer. My father was then employed by E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Company, a manufacturer of high explosives, among other things.\nWhen I was 2 years old, we moved to Midland City, Ohio, where a washing-machine company named Robo-Magic Corporation was beginning to make bomb-release mechanisms and swivel mounts for machine guns on B-17 bombers. The plastics industry was then in its infancy, and Father was sent to Robo-Magic to determine what synthetic materials from Du Pont could be used in the weapons systems in place of metal, in order to make them lighter.\nBy the time the war was over, the company had gotten out of the washing-machine business entirely, had changed its name to Barrytron, Limited, and was making weapon, airplane, and motor vehicle parts composed of plastics it had developed on its own. My father had become the company\u2019s Vice-President in Charge of Research and Development.\nWhen I was about 17, Du Pont bought Barrytron in order to capture several of its patents. One of the plastics Father had helped to develop, I remember, had the ability to scatter radar signals, so that an airplane clad in it would look like a flock of geese to our enemies.\nTHIS MATERIAL, WHICH has since been used to make virtually indestructible skateboards and crash helmets and skis and motorcycle fenders and so on, was an excuse, when I was a boy, for increasing security precautions at Barrytron. To keep Communists from finding out how it was made, a single fence topped with barbed wire was no longer adequate. A second fence was put outside that one, and the space between them was patrolled around the clock by humorless, jackbooted armed guards with lean and hungry Dobermans.\nWHEN DU PONT took over Barrytron, the double fence, the Dobermans, my father and all, I was a high school senior, all set to go to the University of Michigan to learn how to be a journalist, to serve John Q. Public\u2019s right to know.

just one voice\u2014a young woman, I think. It\u2019s so soft I can\u2019t make out what she\u2019s saying.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, K2XWL? Can you hear me, K2XWL?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s calling my name. Do you hear it? She\u2019s calling my name,\u201d said Major Rice.\n\u201cJam the frequency, dammit!\u201d cried the General. \u201cYell, whistle\u2014do something!\u201d\nEarly-morning traffic past the university came to a honking, bad-tempered stop, as Groszinger absently crossed the street against the light, on his way back to his office and the radio room. He looked up in surprise, mumbled an apology, and hurried to the curb. He had had a solitary breakfast in an all-night diner a block and a half from the laboratory building, and then he\u2019d taken a long walk. He had hoped that getting away for a couple of hours would clear his head\u2014but the feeling of confusion and helplessness was still with him. Did the world have a right to know, or didn\u2019t it?\nThere had been no more messages from Major Rice. At the General\u2019s orders, the frequency had been jammed. Now the unexpected eavesdroppers could hear nothing but a steady whine at 25,000 megacycles. General Dane had reported the dilemma to Washington shortly after midnight. Perhaps orders as to what to do with Major Rice had come through by now.\nGroszinger paused in a patch of sunlight on the laboratory building\u2019s steps, and read again the front-page news story, which ran fancifully for a column, beneath the headline \u201cMystery Radio Message Reveals Possible Will Fraud.\u201d The story told of two radio amateurs, experimenting illegally on the supposedly unused ultra-high-frequency band, who had been amazed to hear a man chattering about voices and a will. The amateurs had broken the law, operating on an unassigned frequency, but they hadn\u2019t kept their mouths shut about their discovery. Now hams all over the world would be building sets so they could listen in, too.\n\u201cMorning, sir. Nice morning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said a guard coming off duty. He was a cheerful Irishman.\n\u201cFine morning, all right,\u201d agreed Groszinger. \u201cClouding up a little in the west, maybe.\u201d He wondered what the guard would say if he told him what he knew. He would laugh, probably.\nGroszinger\u2019s secretary was dusting off his desk when he walked in. \u201cYou could use some sleep, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d she said. \u201cHonestly, why you men don\u2019t take better care of yourselves I just don\u2019t know.

Their content did not matter. Friends agreed with friends, in order to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with enemies, in order to express enmity.\n\u201cThe ideas Earthlings held didn\u2019t matter for hundreds of thousands of years, since they couldn\u2019t do much about them anyway. Ideas might as well be badges as anything.\n\u201cThey even had a saying about the futility of ideas: \u2018If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.\u2019\n\u201cAnd then Earthlings discovered tools. Suddenly agreeing with friends could be a form of suicide or worse. But agreements went on, not for the sake of common sense or decency or self-preservation, but for friendliness.\n\u201cEarthlings went on being friendly, when they should have been thinking instead. And even when they built computers to do some thinking for them, they designed them not so much for wisdom as for friendliness. So they were doomed. Homicidal beggars could ride.\u201d\n3\nWITHIN A CENTURY of little Kago\u2019s arrival on Earth, according to Trout\u2019s novel, every form of life on that once peaceful and moist and nourishing blue-green ball was dying or dead. Everywhere were the shells of the great beetles which men had made and worshipped. They were automobiles. They had killed everything.\nLittle Kago himself died long before the planet did. He was attempting to lecture on the evils of the automobile in a bar in Detroit. But he was so tiny that nobody paid any attention to him. He lay down to rest for a moment, and a drunk automobile worker mistook him for a kitchen match. He killed Kago by trying to strike him repeatedly on the underside of the bar.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTrout received only one fan letter before 1972. It was from an eccentric millionaire, who hired a private detective agency to discover who and where he was.

It\u2019s half French poodle and half Chinese shih tzu.\nIt\u2019s a shit-poo.\nAnd I thank you for your attention, and I\u2019m out of here.\nWailing Shall Be in All Streets\nIt was a routine speech we got during our first day of basic training, delivered by a wiry little lieutenant: \u201cMen, up to now you\u2019ve been good, clean, American boys with an American\u2019s love for sportsmanship and fair play. We\u2019re here to change that. Our job is to make you the meanest, dirtiest bunch of scrappers in the history of the World. From now on you can forget the Marquess of Queensberry Rules and every other set of rules. Anything and everything goes. Never hit a man above the belt when you can kick him below it. Make the bastard scream. Kill him any way you can. Kill, kill, kill, do you understand?\u201d\nHis talk was greeted with nervous laughter and general agreement that he was right. \u201cDidn\u2019t Hitler and Tojo say the Americans were a bunch of softies? Ha! They\u2019ll find out.\u201d And of course, Germany and Japan did find out: a toughened-up democracy poured forth a scalding fury that could not be stopped. It was a war of reason against barbarism, supposedly, with the issues at stake on such a high plane that most of our feverish fighters had no idea why they were fighting\u2014other than that the enemy was a bunch of bastards. A new kind of war, with all destruction, all killing approved. Germans would ask, \u201cWhy are you Americans fighting us?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re sure beating the hell out of you,\u201d was a stock answer.\nA lot of people relished the idea of total war: it had a modern ring to it, in keeping with our spectacular technology. To them it was like a football game: \u201cGive \u2019em the axe, the axe, the axe\u2026\u201d Three small-town merchants\u2019 wives, middle-aged and plump, gave me a ride when I was hitchhiking home from Camp Atterbury. \u201cDid you kill a lot of them Germans?\u201d asked the driver, making cheerful small-talk. I told her I didn\u2019t know. This was taken for modesty. As I was getting out of the car, one of the ladies patted me on the shoulder in motherly fashion: \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019d like to get over and kill some of them dirty Japs now, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d We exchanged knowing winks. I didn\u2019t tell those simple souls that I had been captured after a week at the front; and more to the point, what I knew and thought about killing dirty Germans, about total war. The reason for my being sick at heart then and now has to do with an incident that received cursory treatment in the American newspapers. In February, 1945, Dresden, Germany, was destroyed, and with it over one hundred thousand human beings. I was there. Not many know how tough America got.\nI was among a group of one hundred and fifty infantry privates, captured in the Bulge breakthrough and put to work in Dresden. Dresden, we were told, was the only major German city to have escaped bombing so far. That was in January, 1945. She owed her good fortune to her unwarlike countenance: hospitals, breweries, food-processing plants, surgical supply houses, ceramics, musical instrument factories, and the like. Since the war, hospitals had become her prime concern. Every day hundreds of wounded came into the tranquil sanctuary from the east and west. At night we would hear the dull rumble of distant air raids. \u201cChemnitz is getting it tonight,\u201d we used to say, and speculated what it might be like to be under the yawning bomb-bays and the bright young men with their dials and cross-hairs. \u201cThank heaven we\u2019re in an \u2018open city,\u2019\u201d we thought, and so thought the thousands of refugees\u2014women, children, and old men\u2014who came in a forlorn stream from the smouldering wreckage of Berlin, Leipzig, Breslau, Munich\u2026. They flooded the city to twice its normal population.\nThere was no war in Dresden. True, planes came over nearly every day and the sirens wailed, but the planes were always en route elsewhere. The alarms furnished a relief period in a tedious work day, a social event, a chance to gossip in the shelters. The shelters, in fact, were not much more than a gesture, casual recognition of the national emergency: wine cellars and basements with benches in them and sand bags blocking the windows, for the most part. There were a few more adequate bunkers in the center of the city, close to the government offices, but nothing like the staunch subterranean fortress that rendered Berlin impervious to her daily pounding. Dresden had no reason to prepare for attack\u2014and thereby hangs a beastly tale.\nDresden was surely among the World\u2019s most lovely cities. Her streets were broad, lined with shade-trees. She was sprinkled with countless little parks and statuary. She had marvelous old churches, libraries, museums, theaters, art galleries, beer gardens, a zoo, and a renowned university. It was at one time a tourist\u2019s paradise. They would be far better informed on the city\u2019s delights than am I. But the impression I have is that in Dresden\u2014in the physical city\u2014were the symbols of the good life; pleasant, honest, intelligent. In the Swastika\u2019s shadow those symbols of the dignity and hope of mankind stood waiting, monuments to truth. The accumulated treasure of hundreds of years, Dresden spoke eloquently of those things excellent in European civilization wherein our debt lies deep. I was a prisoner, hungry, dirty, and full of hate for our captors, but I loved that city and saw the blessed wonder of her past and the rich promise of her future.", 0.12986775219729763], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
