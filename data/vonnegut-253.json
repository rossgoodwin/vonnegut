Dull thunder came from the buildings around him, a truck honked at him, and a cinder blew in his eye. He dabbed at the cinder with a corner of his handkerchief and finally got it out. When his vision was restored, he looked about himself for Building 31, where his new office and supervisor were. Four busy streets fanned out from where he stood, and each stretched seemingly to infinity.\nHe stopped a passerby who was in less of a desperate hurry than the rest. \"Could you tell me, please, how to find Building 31, Mr. Flammer\u2019s office?\"\nThe man he asked was old and bright-eyed, apparently getting as much pleasure from the clangor and smells and nervous activity of the Works as David would have gotten from April in Paris. He squinted at David\u2019s badge and then at his face. \"Just starting out, are you?\"\n\"Yes sir. My first day.\"\n\"What do you know about that?\" The old man shook his head wonderingly, and winked. \"Just starting out. Building 31? Well, sir, when I first came to work here in 1899, you could see Building 31 from here, with nothing between us and it but mud. Now it\u2019s all built up. See that water tank up there, about a quarter of a mile? Well, Avenue 17 branches off there, and you follow that almost to the end, then cut across the tracks, and\u2014 Just starting out, eh? Well, I\u2019d better walk you up there. Came here for just a minute to talk to the pension folks, but that can wait.

At a dinner in my honor in Moscow, she was saluted by her colleagues as being unquestionably the finest translator in the Soviet Union.\nShe is approaching eighty, and I wish her to see the United States, whose literature she has served so well, before she dies.\nThe authorities in the Soviet Union, for reasons unknown to me, have been reluctant to let her travel outside the country. They are sending four translators here next spring, but Mrs. Rait is not among them.\nSo I am now attempting to put mild pressure on those authorities to let her come here. An invitation from me to her, person to person, has proved futile in the past, and would prove to be futile again. The best advice I have from our State Department and from friends in the Soviet Union is that an invitation must come from an educational institution in order to be considered seriously.\nYour university has kindly and wisely, in my opinion, agreed to issue the invitation.\nFor my part, I have offered my services as a participant in seminars and as a companion to Mrs. Rait and whatever, free of charge.\nI have, moreover, given the University a cashier\u2019s check for three thousand dollars ($3000.00), guaranteeing that the University will have none of its own funds at risk in this enterprise.\nIf Mrs. Rait is unable to come to America, then that check will be returned to me.\nNow then: If Mrs. Rait comes, it will be an event of tremendous importance not just for me, but for the country, the University, and for literary people everywhere.
