"sentiment": ["I think it is interesting that you are a mason. That is a good trade. You talk as if you lay up mostly stone. There aren\u2019t many people left in America who can really lay up stone. It\u2019s almost all cement-block work and bricks here. It probably is over there, too. I don\u2019t mean to say Russia isn\u2019t modern. I know it is.\nBud and I laid up quite a bit of block when we built the gas station here, with an apartment up over it. If you looked at the first course of block along the back wall, you would have to laugh, because you can see how Bud and I learned as we went. It\u2019s strong enough, but it sure looks lousy. One thing wasn\u2019t so funny. When we were hanging the rails for the overhead door, Bud slipped on the ladder, and he grabbed a sharp edge on the mounting bracket, and he cut a tendon on his hand. He was scared to death his hand would be crippled, and that would keep him out of the Air Force. His hand had to be operated on three times before it was right again, and every operation hurt something awful. But Bud would have let them operate a hundred times, if they had to, because there was just one thing he wanted to be, and that was a flyer.\nOne reason I wish your Mr. Koshevoi had thought to mail me your letter was the picture you sent with it. The newspapers got that, too, and it didn\u2019t come out too clear in the papers. But one thing we couldn\u2019t get over was all that beautiful water behind you. Somehow, when we think about Russia, we never think about any water around. I guess that shows how ignorant we are. Hazel and I live up over the gas station, and we can see water, too. We can see the Atlantic Ocean, or an inlet of it they call Indian River. We can see Merritt Island, too, out in the water, and we can see the place Bud\u2019s rocket went up from. It is called Cape Canaveral. I guess you know that. It isn\u2019t any secret where he went up from. They couldn\u2019t keep that tremendous missile secret any more than they could keep the Empire State Building secret. Tourists came from miles around to take pictures of it.\nThe story was, its warhead was filled with flash powder, and it was going to hit the moon and make a big show. Hazel and I thought that\u2019s what the story was, too. When it took off, we got set for a big flash on the moon. We didn\u2019t know it was our Bud up in the warhead. We didn\u2019t even know he was in Florida. He couldn\u2019t get in touch with us. We thought he was up at Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod. That was the last place we heard from him. And then that thing went up, right in the middle of our view out the picture window.\nYou say you\u2019re superstitious sometimes, Mr. Ivankov. Me too. Sometimes I can\u2019t help thinking it was all meant to be right from the very first\u2014even the way our picture window is aimed. There weren\u2019t any rockets going up down here when we built. We moved down here from Pittsburgh, which maybe you know is the center of our steel industry. And we figured we maybe weren\u2019t going to break any records for pumping gas, but at least we\u2019d be way far away from any bomb targets, in case there was another war. And the next thing we know, a rocket center goes up almost next door, and our little boy is a man, and he goes up in a rocket and dies.\nThe more we think about it, the more we\u2019re sure it was meant to be. I never got it straight in my mind about religion in Russia. You don\u2019t mention it. Anyway, we are religious, and we think God singled out Bud and your boy, too, to die in a special way for a special reason. When everybody was asking, \"How is it going to end?\"\u2014well, maybe this is how God meant for it to end. I don\u2019t see how it can keep on.\nMr. Ivankov, one thing that threw me as much as anything was the way Mr. Koshevoi kept telling the U.N. that Bud was a killer. He called Bud a mad dog and a gangster. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t feel that way, because that\u2019s the wrong way to feel about Bud. It was flying and not killing he liked. Mr. Koshevoi made a big thing out of how cultured and educated and all your boy was, and how wild and ignorant mine was. He made it sound as though a juvenile delinquent had murdered a college professor.\nBud never was in any trouble with the police, and he didn\u2019t have a cruel streak. He never went hunting, for instance, and he never drove like a crazy man, and he got drunk only one time I know of, and that was an experiment. He was proud of his reflexes, see? His health was on his mind all the time, because he had to be healthy to be a great flyer. I keep looking around for the right word for Bud, and I guess the one Hazel suggested is the best one. It sounded kind of stuffed-up to me at first, but now I\u2019m used to it, and it sounds right. Hazel says Bud was dignified. Man and boy, that\u2019s what he was\u2014straight and serious and polite and pretty much alone.\nI think he knew he was going to die young. That one time he got drunk, just to find out what alcohol was, he talked to me more than he\u2019d ever talked before. He was nineteen then. And then was the only time he let me know he knew death was all balled up in what he wanted to do with his life. It wasn\u2019t other people\u2019s deaths he was talking about, Mr. Ivankov. It was his own. \"One nice thing about flying,\" he said to me that night. \"What\u2019s that?\" I said. \"You never know how bad it is till it\u2019s too late,\" he said, \"and when it happens, it happens so fast you never know what hit you.\"\nThat was death he was talking about, and a special, dignified, honorable kind of death. You say you were in the war and had a hard time. Same here, so I guess we both know about what kind of death it was that Bud had in mind. It was a soldier\u2019s death.", 0.09991310959052895], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
