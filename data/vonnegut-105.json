"sentiment": ["September 17, 1965\n[Iowa City]\nTO JANE VONNEGUT\nNelson Algren and Vance Bourjaily were both on the faculty of the Workshop. Algren had gained fame with his novel The Man with the Golden Arm, which won the National Book Award in 1950 and was produced as a major motion picture starring Frank Sinatra. Bourjaily gained literary acclaim for his first novel, The End of My Life, in 1947 and published many other novels.\nDear Wife:\nSome technical poop: We in Iowa City are on Central Standard Time, whereas most of the people around us are on Central Daylight Time. This means that, until you go back on standard time, you will be three hours later than me. I will explain: When it is three o\u2019clock here, it will be six o\u2019clock there. If you call me at ten p.m., it will only be seven here. After you go back on standard time, if you call me at ten p.m., it will be eight here. I can\u2019t be any clearer than that. Tell Nanny, and then, when you need to know, ask her what the hell is going on with all this time business. Anyway, my phone isn\u2019t hooked up yet. When it is, I\u2019ll call you up and tell you what the number is. Ideally, you should call me most of the time. That way, you can take advantage of cheap calling rates that won\u2019t be available to me until three hours later. Just wait until it\u2019s six o\u2019clock there, and we screw \u2019em good.\nI stopped off to see your mother in Fort Wayne. She\u2019s in a smashing new hospital with a woman who was struck by a tornado while asleep. Your mother is her same sparky self. She will be the sole survivor of World War Three. You should be thinking seriously of rigging an apartment for her. I\u2019ve got a hunch, and I think she does, too, that maybe she had better live with us during a good part of what remains of her old age, which I would suppose to be plenty. The lawyer she sold Harve\u2019s firm to is going to sue the hotel for a blue million. He is very burned up about that step down from the bathroom. Riah\u2019s problem right now is to get somebody to take her from Fort Wayne to Indianapolis after her discharge, which will be within the next five days. No Cox has volunteered, and she\u2019s damned if she\u2019ll ask. I told her to try a Vonnegut, and she said she might. Bob has told her to go to Europe before she\u2019s dead, and she has agreed to this. Maybe next summer.\nAlgren hasn\u2019t appeared yet. I haven\u2019t yet met Bourjaily. Things will get social tomorrow, I think\u2014after the GAME. Engle has invited me to a big cocktail party. They don\u2019t know how great I am yet. It will take them about six weeks to understand. A couple of letters were waiting for me: a nutty thing from Angela Jones, and an interesting thing from Warren Miller, who is editor of the Nation now. He wants me to review for him. All of a sudden, everybody is yelling for ignorant reviewers.\nI didn\u2019t put the slightest scratch in Mark\u2019s automobile. It ran like a dollar watch all the way.

The noun (from the Latin fiducia, confidence, trust) in fact identifies a sort of Homo sapiens who will conserve the property, and nowadays especially paper or computer representations of wealth, belonging to other people, including the treasuries of their governments.\nHe or she or it cannot exist, thanks to the brain and the ding-dong, et cetera. So we have in this summer of 1996, rerun or not, and as always, faithless custodians of capital making themselves multimillionaires and multibillionaires, while playing beanbag with money better spent on creating meaningful jobs and training people to fill them, and raising our young and retiring our old in surroundings of respect and safety.\nFor Christ\u2019s sake, let\u2019s help more of our frightened people get through this thing, whatever it is.\nWhy throw money at problems? That is what money is for.\nShould the nation\u2019s wealth be redistributed? It has been and continues to be redistributed to a few people in a manner strikingly unhelpful.\nLet me note that Kilgore Trout and I have never used semicolons. They don\u2019t do anything, don\u2019t suggest anything. They are transvestite hermaphrodites.\nYes, and any dream of taking better care of our people might as well be a transvestite hermaphrodite without some scheme for giving us all the support and companionship of extended families, within which sharing and compassion are more plausible than in an enormous nation, and a Fiduciary may not be as mythical as the Roc and the Phoenix after all.\n50\nI am so old that I can remember when the word fuck was thought to be so full of bad magic that no respectable publication would print it.

Almost all the hooved animals in Germany had been killed and eaten and excreted by human beings, mostly soldiers. So it goes.\nThe Americans were taken to the fifth building inside the gate. It was a one-story cement-block cube with sliding doors in front and back. It had been built as a shelter for pigs about to be butchered. Now it was going to serve as a home away from home for one hundred American prisoners of war. There were bunks in there, and two potbellied stoves and a water tap. Behind it was a latrine, which was a one-rail fence with buckets under it.\nThere was a big number over the door of the building. The number was five. Before the Americans could go inside, their only English-speaking guard told them to memorize their simple address, in case they got lost in the big city. Their address was this: \u201cSchlachthof-f\u00fcnf.\u201d Schlachthof meant slaughterhouse.

Captain Adolf von Kleist concluded that it was now safe for him to come down from the crow\u2019s nest of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin. The ship had been picked clean, and had fewer amenities and navigational aids, even, than had Her Majesty\u2019s Ship Beagle when that brave little wooden sailboat began her voyage around the world on December 27, 1831. The Beagle had had a compass, at least, and a sextant, and navigators who could imagine with considerable accuracy the position of their ship in the clockwork of the universe because of their knowledge of the stars. And the Beagle, moreover, had had oil lanterns and candles for the nighttime, and hammocks for the seamen, and mattresses and pillows for the officers. Anyone determined to spend the night on the Bah\u00eda de Darwin now would have to rest his or her weary head on nude steel, or perhaps do what Hisako Hiroguchi would do when she couldn\u2019t keep her eyes open any longer. Hisako would sit on the lid of the toilet off the main saloon, and lay her head on her arms, which were folded atop the washbasin in there.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI have likened the mob at the hotel to a tidal wave, whose crest swept past the bus, never to return again. I would say that the mob at the waterfront was more like a tornado. Now that ferocious whirlwind was moving inland in the twilight, and feeding on itself, since its members had themselves become worth robbing\u2014carrying lobsters and wine and electronic gear and drapes and coat hangers and cigarettes and chairs and rolls of carpeting and towels and bedspreads, and on and on.\nSo the Captain clambered down from the crow\u2019s nest. The rungs bruised his bare and tender feet. He had the ship and the entire waterfront all to himself, as far as he could see. He went to his cabin first, since he was wearing only his undershorts. He hoped that the looters had left him a little something to wear. When he turned on the light switch in there, though, nothing happened\u2014because all the light bulbs were gone.\nThere was electricity, anyway\u2014since the ship still had her banks of storage batteries down in the engine room. The thing was: The light-bulb thieves had blacked out the engine room before the batteries and generators and starter motors could be stolen. So, in a sense, they had unwittingly done humanity a big favor. Thanks to them, the ship would still run. Without her navigational aids, she was as blind as Selena MacIntosh\u2014but she was still the fastest ship in that part of the world, and she could slice water at top speed for twenty days without refueling, if necessary, provided nothing went wrong in the pitch-dark engine room.\nAs things would turn out, though: After only five days at sea, something would go very much wrong in the pitch-dark engine room.", 0.05024509803921569], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["green", 0.07694155882505647], ["modern", 0.0705105706432728], ["wheel", 0.07044271638317319], ["wearing", 0.06694973350661887], ["real", 0.06164055080842807], ["parade", 0.06120075397570725], ["museum", 0.06099923880490661], ["fred", 0.059698167760388415], ["gregory", 0.04497282581513267], ["caught", 0.04114638868535692], ["budding", 0.035221358191586595], ["21", 0.035221358191586595], ["employee", 0.035221358191586595], ["booming", 0.035221358191586595], ["manufactured", 0.035221358191586595], ["hasidic", 0.035221358191586595], ["motorcar", 0.035221358191586595], ["fiftieth", 0.035221358191586595], ["orientals", 0.035221358191586595], ["blatting", 0.035221358191586595], ["seater", 0.035221358191586595], ["sublime", 0.035221358191586595], ["provoke", 0.035221358191586595], ["catholic", 0.035221358191586595], ["irishmen", 0.035221358191586595], ["traffic", 0.035221358191586595], ["hell", 0.034335380368477046], ["art", 0.03354272101340905], ["life", 0.03354272101340905], ["coming", 0.033474866753309435], ["jones", 0.03190442627789099], ["job", 0.03118352999428731], ["saving", 0.030600376987853624], ["arguments", 0.030600376987853624], ["cord", 0.030600376987853624], ["block", 0.030600376987853624], ["jews", 0.030600376987853624], ["northward", 0.030600376987853624], ["walking", 0.027897276267132527], ["sperm", 0.027897276267132527], ["lucky", 0.027897276267132527], ["experiencing", 0.027897276267132527], ["1936", 0.027897276267132527], ["convertible", 0.027897276267132527], ["aviator", 0.027897276267132527], ["love", 0.02700142920955342], ["guess", 0.02700142920955342], ["artist", 0.02601332291417046], ["avenue", 0.025979395784120656], ["transportation", 0.025979395784120656], ["sat", 0.025979395784120656], ["roman", 0.025979395784120656], ["shade", 0.025979395784120656], ["marilee", 0.025517410870110353], ["awful", 0.024491772108692588], ["patrick", 0.024491772108692588], ["automobile", 0.024491772108692588], ["dan", 0.024455214363831385], ["caused", 0.02327629506339956], ["putting", 0.02327629506339956], ["wu", 0.02327629506339956], ["feeling", 0.02327629506339956], ["cry", 0.02224862386455117], ["waiting", 0.02224862386455117], ["stuck", 0.02224862386455117], ["saint", 0.02224862386455117], ["ready", 0.02224862386455117], ["missed", 0.021358414580387685], ["sam", 0.021358414580387685], ["going", 0.020981944482814586], ["egypt", 0.019870790904959617], ["longer", 0.019870790904959617], ["stand", 0.018655313859666588], ["shot", 0.01812169580850968], ["black", 0.017167690184238523], ["top", 0.016737433376654717], ["rest", 0.016333269231211818], ["depression", 0.016333269231211818], ["twenty", 0.015952213138945494], ["feet", 0.015249809701226653], ["order", 0.015249809701226653], ["half", 0.014924541940097104], ["kind", 0.014614408502531153], ["front", 0.01403433265593362], ["beautiful", 0.013762186025798586], ["wouldn", 0.01350071460477671], ["people", 0.01342050146295911], ["sort", 0.013249112418224398], ["war", 0.013055181807117582], ["dead", 0.012772719325010099], ["lot", 0.012546708980505554], ["years", 0.01235326536064529], ["best", 0.012116452172921748], ["american", 0.011911307781810055], ["day", 0.010970783793410684], ["wasn", 0.00941335145220065], ["kitchen", 0.009009187306757753], ["three", 0.008752745434572445], ["great", 0.008151738121277128], ["good", 0.007925727776772586], ["time", 0.004932726309786564]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWhat do you think love is anyway?\u201d she said.\n\u201cI guess I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou know the best part\u2014\u201d she said, \u201cwalking around like this and feeling good about everything. If you missed the rest of it, I certainly wouldn\u2019t cry for you.\u201d\nSo we went to the Museum of Modern Art for maybe the fiftieth time. I had been with Gregory for almost three years then, and was just a shade under twenty years old. I wasn\u2019t a budding artist anymore. I was an employee of an artist, and lucky to have a job of any kind. An awful lot of people were putting up with any sort of job, and waiting for the Great Depression to end, so that real life could get going again. But we would also have to get through another World War before real life could get going again.\nDon\u2019t you love it? This is real life we are now experiencing.\nBut let me tell you that life seemed as real as Hell back in 1936, when Dan Gregory caught Marilee and me coming out of the Museum of Modern Art.\n21\nDAN GREGORY caught Marilee and me coming out of the Museum of Modern Art while a Saint Patrick\u2019s Day parade was blatting and booming northward on Fifth Avenue, a half a block away. The parade caused Gregory\u2019s automobile, a convertible Cord, the most beautiful American means of transportation ever manufactured, to be stuck in traffic right in front of the Museum of Modern Art. This was a two-seater with the top down, and with Fred Jones, the old World War One aviator, at the wheel.\nWhat Fred may have been doing with his sperm I never found out. If I had to guess, I would say that he was saving it up like me. He had that look as he sat at the wheel of that sublime motorcar, but the hell with Fred. He was going to be O.K. for quite a while longer, until he was shot dead in Egypt\u2014whereas I was about to go into the real world, ready or not, and try to stand on my own two feet!\nEverybody was wearing something green!

He enlisted in the infantry, fought with distinction, was commissioned in the field, was mentioned four times in dispatches. He was gassed in the second Battle of Ypres, was hospitalized for two years, and then discharged.\nAnd he set sail for home, for Tobago, alone in the Lady\u2019s Slipper again.\nWhen only eighty miles from home, he was stopped and searched by a German submarine, the U-99. He was taken prisoner, and his little vessel was used by the Huns for target practice. While still surfaced, the submarine was surprised and captured by the British destroyer, the Raven.\nJohnson and the Germans were taken on board the destroyer and the U-99 was sunk.\nThe Raven was bound for the Mediterranean, but it never got there. It lost its steering; it could only wallow helplessly or make grand, clockwise circles. It came to rest at last in the Cape Verde Islands.\nJohnson stayed in those islands for eight months, awaiting some sort of transportation to the Western Hemisphere.\nHe got a job at last as a crewman on a fishing vessel that was carrying illegal immigrants to New Bedford, Massachusetts. The vessel was blown ashore at Newport, Rhode Island.\nBy that time Johnson had developed a conviction that something was trying to get him somewhere for some reason. So he stayed in Newport for a while to see if he had a destiny there. He worked as a gardener and carpenter on the famous Rumfoord Estate.\nDuring that time, he glimpsed many distinguished guests of the Rumfoords, among them, J.P. Morgan, General John J. Pershing, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Enrico Caruso, Warren Gamaliel Harding, and Harry Houdini. And it was during that time that the First World War came to an end, having killed ten million persons and wounded twenty million, Johnson among them.\nWhen the war ended, the young rakehell of the Rumfoord family, Remington Rumfoord, IV, proposed to sail his steam yacht, the Scheherazade, around the world, visiting Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Egypt, India, China, and Japan.

he had said to me so long ago in Cleveland, at the Science Fair: \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry, Son?\u201d\n21\nREMEMBERING MY HOMECOMING from Vietnam always puts me in mind of Bruce Bergeron, a student of mine at Tarkington. I have already mentioned Bruce. He joined the Ice Capades as a chorus boy after winning his Associate in the Arts and Sciences Degree, and was murdered in Dubuque. His father was President of the Wildlife Rescue Federation.\nWhen I had Bruce in Music Appreciation I played a recording of Tchaikovsky\u2019s 1812 Overture. I explained to the class that the composition was about an actual event in history, the defeat of Napoleon in Russia. I asked the students to think of some major event in their own lives, and to imagine what kind of music might best describe it. They were to think about it for a week before telling anybody about the event or the music. I wanted their brains to cook and cook with music, with the lid on tight.\nThe event Bruce Bergeron set to music in his head was getting stuck between floors in an elevator when he was maybe 6 years old, on the way with a Haitian nanny to a post-Christmas white sale at Bloomingdale\u2019s department store in New York City. They were supposed to be going to the American Museum of Natural History, but the nanny, without permission from her employers, wanted to send some bargain bedding to relatives in Haiti first.\nThe elevator got stuck right below the floor where the white sale was going on. It was an automatic elevator. There was no operator. It was jammed. When it became obvious that the elevator was going to stay there, somebody pushed the alarm button, which the passengers could hear clanging far below. According to Bruce, this was the first time in his life that he had ever been in some kind of trouble that grownups couldn\u2019t take care of at once.\nTHERE WAS A 2-way speaker in the elevator, and a woman\u2019s voice came on, telling the people to stay calm. Bruce remembered that she made this particular point: Nobody was to try to climb out through the trapdoor in the ceiling. If anybody did that, Bloomingdale\u2019s could not be responsible for whatever might happen to him or her afterward.\nTime went by. More time went by. To little Bruce it seemed that they had been trapped there for a century. It was probably more like 20 minutes.\nLittle Bruce believed himself to be at the center of a major event in American history. He imagined that not only his parents but the President of the United States must be hearing about it on television. When they were rescued, he thought, bands and cheering crowds would greet him.\nLittle Bruce expected a banquet and a medal for not panicking, and for not saying he had to go to the bathroom.", 0.1492614367614368], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["durant", 0.31519545122125586], ["lunch", 0.17414554052642528], ["teddy", 0.1688654831629972], ["marion", 0.12341320902791883], ["boat", 0.11011927105715932], ["jaunty", 0.0957958101152682], ["disapprovingly", 0.0957958101152682], ["counterfeiting", 0.0957958101152682], ["shrimp", 0.0957958101152682], ["danced", 0.0844327415814986], ["stage", 0.0844327415814986], ["sauce", 0.0844327415814986], ["ballet", 0.0844327415814986], ["secrets", 0.0844327415814986], ["drama", 0.0844327415814986], ["painting", 0.0844327415814986], ["whirlwind", 0.0844327415814986], ["excited", 0.07778577259611887], ["casual", 0.07306967304772902], ["food", 0.07306967304772902], ["relieved", 0.07306967304772902], ["polite", 0.06941158204257804], ["grew", 0.06941158204257804], ["center", 0.06941158204257804], ["echoed", 0.06941158204257804], ["interest", 0.06389564373731224], ["merry", 0.06389564373731224], ["drive", 0.061706604513959415], ["staring", 0.061706604513959415], ["flat", 0.059775735076969524], ["um", 0.059775735076969524], ["walk", 0.058048513508808436], ["lou", 0.058048513508808436], ["step", 0.058048513508808436], ["funny", 0.0564860515448031], ["eat", 0.0564860515448031], ["awful", 0.052532575203542646], ["terrible", 0.052532575203542646], ["spoke", 0.05140154452342868], ["tired", 0.04841266654319992], ["thinking", 0.04841266654319992], ["major", 0.04116950666977305], ["full", 0.04116950666977305], ["girl", 0.04003847598965909], ["men", 0.03898046744642022], ["feel", 0.036600434498149766], ["pretty", 0.036600434498149766], ["talk", 0.03267863631674264], ["three", 0.030709057434085866], ["life", 0.02638422807269017], ["good", 0.019345988900316274]], "sentiment": ["\u201cDo you really feel that awful?\u201d\n\u201cI was thinking of lunch.
