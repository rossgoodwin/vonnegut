I\u2019ve had enough of trying. I want to go to sleep now.\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to live this way!\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I came here to tell you. I\u2019ll protect you, Mary Kathleen. We\u2019ll hire people we can trust absolutely. Howard Hughes hired Mormons\u2014because they have such high moral standards.

She was a freak that many people would have liked to photograph or capture or torment in some way\u2014or kill. People would have liked to kill her for her hands or her money, but also for revenge. RAMJAC had stolen or ruined many other businesses and had even had a hand in the toppling of governments in countries that were small and weak.\nSo she dared not reveal her true identity to anyone but her faithful Mormons, and she had to keep moving all the time. And so it came to pass that she was staying on the top floor of a RAMJAC hotel in Managua, Nicaragua. There were twenty luxury suites on the floor, and she hired them all. The two stairways from the floor below were blocked with brutal masonry, like the archway in the lobby of the Arapahoe. The controls on the elevators were set so that only one could reach the top, and that one was manned by a Mormon.\nNot even the manager of the hotel, supposedly, knew who she really was. But everyone in Managua, surely, must have suspected who she really was.\nBe that as it may: She rashly resolved to go out into the city alone one day, to taste however briefly what she had not tasted for years\u2014what it was like to be just another human being in the world.

Boaz didn\u2019t answer Unk right away. He leafed through the ragged book instead. \"I expect,\" he said at last.\nUnk thought about the crazy appeal in the name of love. He did something he hadn\u2019t done for a long time. He laughed. He thought it was an hysterical ending for the nightmare\u2014that the brainless membranes on the walls should speak of love.\nBoaz suddenly grabbed Unk, rattled poor Unk\u2019s dry bones. \"I\u2019d appreciate it, Unk,\" said Boaz tautly, \"if you\u2019d just let me think whatever I\u2019m going to think about that message about how they love me. I mean\u2014\" he said, \"you know\u2014\" he said, \"it don\u2019t necessarily have to make sense to you. I mean\u2014\" he said, \"you know\u2014\" he said, \"there ain\u2019t really any call for you to say anything about it, one way or the other. I mean,\" he said, \"you know\u2014\" he said, \"these animals ain\u2019t necessarily your dish. You don\u2019t necessarily have to like \u2019em, or understand \u2019em, or say anything about \u2019em. I mean\u2014\" said Boaz, \"you know\u2014\" said Boaz, \"the message wasn\u2019t addressed to you. It\u2019s me they said they loved. That lets you out.\"\nHe let Unk go, turned attention to the comic book again. His broad, brown, slab-muscled back amazed Unk. Living apart from Boaz, Unk had flattered himself into thinking he was a physical match for Boaz. He saw now what a pathetic delusion this had been.\nThe muscles in Boaz\u2019s back slid over one another in slow patterns that were counterpoint to the quick movements of his page-turning fingers. \"You know so much about traps and things,\" said Boaz. \"How you know there ain\u2019t some worse trap waiting for us if we go flying out of here?\"\nBefore Unk could answer him, Boaz remembered that he had left the tape recorder playing and unguarded.\n\"Ain\u2019t nobody watching out for \u2019em at all!\" he cried. He left Unk, ran to rescue the harmoniums.\nWhile Boaz was gone, Unk made plans for turning the space ship upside down. That was the solution to the puzzle of how to get out.

You\u2019re the captain.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the captain.\u201d\n17\nEDGAR R. B. HAGSTROHM, thirty-seven, R&R\u2014131313, Undercoater First Class, 22nd Surface Preserving Battalion, 58th Maintenance Regiment, 110th Building and Grounds Division, Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps, had been named after his father\u2019s favorite author, the creator of Tarzan\u2014Tarzan, who, far away from the soot and biting winter of the Hagstrohms\u2019 home town, Chicago, made friends with lions and elephants and apes, and swung through trees on vines, and was built like a brick outhouse with square wheels and Venetian blinds, and took what he wanted of civilization\u2019s beautiful women in tree houses, and left the rest of civilization alone. E. R. B. Hagstrohm liked Tarzan as much as his father had, and hated being a little man and being in Chicago ten times as much.\nAnd Edgar was reading about Tarzan in the bedroom when his fat wife, Wanda, called to him from her station before the picture window in the front room of their prefabricated home in Proteus Park, Chicago, a postwar development of three thousand dream houses for three thousand families with presumably identical dreams. \u201cGosh, here he comes, Edgar!\u201d\n\u201cAll right, all right, all right,\u201d said Edgar. \u201cSo he\u2019s coming! So what am I supposed to do, holler bloody murder, kiss his feet, and faint?\u201d He took his time about getting off the bed, and he didn\u2019t smooth out the dent he\u2019d made in the bedding. He laid his book open on the bedside table, so the visitors would see that he was a reader, and started for the living room. \u201cWhat\u2019s he look like, Wan?\u201d\n\u201cYou gotta see, Ed\u2014like a Chinese bird cage or something, all gold and fancy.\u201d\nThe Shah of Bratpuhr had asked his guide, Doctor Ewing J. Halyard, if he might see the home of a typical Takaru, freely translated, from one culture to another, as \u201caverage man.\u201d The request had been made as they were passing through Chicago from Carlsbad Caverns, and Halyard had stopped off at the local personnel office for the name of a representative American in the neighborhood.\nThe personnel machines had considered the problem and ejected the card of Edgar R. B. Hagstrohm, who was statistically average in every respect save for the number of his initials: his age (36), his height (5\u20327\u2033), his weight (148 lbs.), his years of marriage (11), his I.Q. (83), the number of his children (2: 1 m., 9; 1 f., 6), the number of his bedrooms (2), his car (3 yr. old Chev. 2 dr. sed.), his education (h.s. grad, 117th in class of 233; maj. in business practice; 2nd string f\u2019ball, b\u2019k\u2019tb\u2019l; soc. comm., sen\u2019r play; no coll.) his vocation (R&R), his avocations (spec\u2019r sports, TV, softb\u2019l, f\u2019sh\u2019g), and his war record (5 yrs., 3 ov\u2019sea; T-4 radioman; 157th Inf. Div.; battle stars: Hjoring, Elbesan, Kabul, Kaifen, Ust Ky-akhta; wounded 4 times; P\u2019ple H\u2019t, 3 cl.; Silv. Star; Br\u2019ze Star, 2 cl.; G\u2019d Cond. Med.).\nAnd the machines could have made an educated guess that, since Hagstrohm had gone that far in being average, he had probably been arrested once, had had sexual experience with five girls before marrying Wanda (only moderately satisfying), and had had two extramarital adventures since (one fleeting and foolish, the other rather long and disturbing), and that he would die at the age of 76.2 of a heart attack.", 0.07230282738095241], "title": "Player Piano"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["key", 0.19051562677956524], ["eddie", 0.16614476696102037], ["ancestors",

white American patriot who wrote the National Anthem. Eddie knew he was descended from Key. He could name more than six hundred of his ancestors, and had at least an anecdote about each. They were Africans, Indians and white men.\nHe knew, for instance, that his mother\u2019s side of the family had once owned the farm on which Sacred Miracle Cave was discovered, that his ancestors had called it \u201cBluebird Farm.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHere was why there were so many young foreign doctors on the hospital staff, incidentally: The country didn\u2019t produce nearly enough doctors for all the sick people it had, but it had an awful lot of money. So it bought doctors from other countries which didn\u2019t have much money.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nEddie Key knew so much about his ancestry because the black part of his family had done what so many African families still do in Africa, which was to have one member of each generation whose duty it was to memorize the history of the family so far. Eddie Key had begun to store in his mind the names and adventures of ancestors on both his mother\u2019s and father\u2019s sides of his family when he was only six years old. As he sat in the front of the disaster vehicle, looking out through the windshield, he had the feeling that he himself was a vehicle, and that his eyes were windshields through which his progenitors could look, if they wished to.\nFrancis Scott Key was only one of thousands back there. On the off-chance that Key might now be having a look at what had become of the United States of America so far, Eddie focussed his eyes on an American flag which was stuck to the windshield. He said this very quietly: \u201cStill wavin\u2019, man.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nEddie Key\u2019s familiarity with a teeming past made life much more interesting to him than it was to Dwayne, for instance, or to me, or to Kilgore Trout, or to almost any white person in Midland City that day. We had no sense of anybody else using our eyes\u2014or our hands. We didn\u2019t even know who our great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers were. Eddie Key was afloat in a river of people who were flowing from here to there in time. Dwayne and Trout and I were pebbles at rest.\nAnd Eddie Key, because he knew so much by heart, was able to have deep, nourishing feelings about Dwayne Hoover, for instance, and about Dr. Cyprian Ukwende, too. Dwayne was a man whose family had taken over Bluebird Farm. Ukwende, an Indaro, was a man whose ancestors had kidnapped an ancestor of Key\u2019s on the West Coast of Africa, a man named Ojumwa.

The Maritimo Brothers Construction Company had done all that at their own expense. It wasn\u2019t even possible to tell that we had once had a fireplace.\nFelix wasn\u2019t around to see the transformation. He had taken a job under an assumed name, although his employers knew who he really was, or who he really had been, as an announcer on a radio station in South Bend, Indiana. This wasn\u2019t a humiliation. It was what he wanted to do, what he said he had been born to do. He was drug free. We were so proud of him.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMother said a significant thing when she saw we didn\u2019t have a fireplace anymore. \u201cOh, dear\u2014I don\u2019t know if I want to go on living without a fireplace.\u201d\n\u201cWhat part of her life,\u201d you might ask, \u201cwas story, and what part was epilogue?\u201d I think her case was similar to Father\u2019s, in that, by the time my brother and I came along, there was nothing left but epilogue. The circumstances of her early life virtually decreed that she live only a pipsqueak story, which was over only a few moments after it had begun. She had nothing to atone for, for example, since she was never tempted to do anything bad in the first place. And she wasn\u2019t going to go seeking any kind of Holy Grail, since that was clearly a man\u2019s job, and she already had a cup that overflowed and overflowed with good things to eat and drink anyway.\nI suppose that\u2019s really what so many American women are complaining about these days: They find their lives short on story and overburdened with epilogue.\nMother\u2019s story ended when she married the handsomest rich man in town.\n27\nMOTHER SAID that thing about not knowing if she wanted to go on living, if she couldn\u2019t have a fireplace\u2014 and then the telephone rang. Mother answered. I used to be the one to answer the telephone, but now she always beat me to it. Almost every call was thrillingly for her, since she had become the local Saint Joan of Arc in a holy war against nonrepresentational art.\nA year had passed since the dedication of the Mildred Barry Memorial Center for the Arts, with speeches and performances by noted creative persons from all over the country.
