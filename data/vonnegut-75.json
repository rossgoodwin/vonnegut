An old man I worked with at General Electric never kept carbons. When somebody asked to see a carbon of such and such a letter, the old man would sit down and write the carbon he thought the somebody would most like to see. The old man\u2019s name was Clyde Waggoner. He was hired away from the N.Y. World by G.E. in the year of my birth, 1922. Let\u2019s see\u2014that was a year before you were born, wasn\u2019t it? I make Mary Otis for vintage 1927. How close am I?\nOne of the great things in The Iceman Cometh is where the male lead tells about his married life and how his wife thanked him sincerely for whatever he did and would have thanked him for murdering her if she had had the opportunity. Why do I bring that up? Well, it turns out not to be particularly relevant\u2014in fact not relevant at all except that I find myself thanking you often. I don\u2019t expect this to drive you to murder.\nI thank a lot of people often\u2014but mostly for nothing. Most people aren\u2019t very good at their jobs. You are superlative at yours, which is editing, and, since I am a writer, my gratitude is extravagant.\nLike symbiosis\u2014which, as Stephen Potter pointed out, was removed from the list of O.K. words in 1951. And wasn\u2019t 1959 a fine year for viable? And my children all know that you and I were present at what must have been the birth of perjorative. (I just tried to look it up, can\u2019t find it anywhere. I must have misspelled it badly.)\nSo how is the house? Beautiful, I\u2019ll bet. There was a simple formula in Better Homes and Gardens once about how much a person should spend on furniture. For a ten thousand dollar house you should have ten thousand dollars\u2019 worth of furniture. You can extrapolate from there to cover your own situation. The only person who ever really did it, I suppose, was William Randolph Hearst.\nAnother very long chapter of \u201cNation of Two\u201d goes to the typist this weekend. In about two weeks I hope to have maybe 100 more pages, which will take us to about page 150, which should entitle me to another good whack of money, eh? Process this thing quickly, and we will hit the Nazi revival right on the nose.

Trout was shouting, \u201cWake up! For God\u2019s sake, wake up! Free will! Free will!\u201d\nNot only was the steel front door lying flat on the floor, bearing the enigmatic message \u201cUCK AR,\u201d so Trout had to lope across it to reach Prince. It was still hinged and locked to the door frame. The door frame itself had let go on impact. It had parted from the surrounding masonry. The door and its hinges and bolts and whoozit were to all practical purposes as good as new, their frame had offered so little resistance to the berserk hook-and-ladder.\nThe contractor who installed the door and frame had cut corners when it came to securing the frame to the masonry.

As things turned out, he would have been better off simply to hand over everything to George Metzger without a trial. At least he wouldn\u2019t have had to listen to proofs that he had admired Hitler, and that he had never done an honest day\u2019s work, and that he only pretended to be a painter, and that he had no education beyond high school, and that he had been arrested several times during his youth in other cities, and that he had regularly insulted his working relatives, and on and on.\nThere were enough ironies, certainly, to sink a battleship. The young lawyer who represented George Metzger had offered his services first to Father. He was Bernard Ketchum, and the Maritimo brothers had brought him to the coroner\u2019s inquest, urging Father to hire him and start using him then and there. He wasn\u2019t in the armed forces because he was blind in one eye. When he was little, a playmate had shot him in the eye with a beebee gun.\nKetchum was ruthless on Metzger\u2019s behalf, just as he would have been ruthless with Metzger, if Father had hired him. He certainly never let the jury forget that Mrs. Metzger had been pregnant. He made the embryo a leading personality in town. It was always \u201cshe,\u201d since it was known to have been a female. And, although Ketchum himself had never seen her, he spoke familiarly of her perfectly formed little fingers and toes.\nYears later, Felix and I would have reason to hire Ketchum, to sue the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Mar\u00edtimo Brothers Construction Company and the Ohio Valley Ornamental Concrete Company for killing our mother with a radioactive mantelpiece.\nThat is how Felix and I got the money to buy this hotel, and old Ketchum is also a partner.\nMy instructions to Ketchum were these: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to tell the jury about Mother\u2019s perfectly formed little fingers and toes.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAfter Father lost the lawsuit, we had to let all the servants go. There was no way to pay them, and Mary Hoobler and all the rest of them left in tears. Father was still in prison, so at least he was spared those wrenching farewells.

It was The Gospel from Outer Space, by Kilgore Trout. It was about a visitor from outer space, shaped very much like a Tralfamadorian, by the way. The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn, if he could, why Christians found it so easy to be cruel. He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament. He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people, among other things, to be merciful, even to the lowest of the low.\nBut the Gospels actually taught this:\nBefore you kill somebody, make absolutely sure he isn\u2019t well connected. So it goes.\nThe flaw in the Christ stories, said the visitor from outer space, was that Christ, who didn\u2019t look like much, was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe.

Nothing more he did from that moment on until, many busy years later, he entered the blue tunnel into the Afterlife, would have the slightest bearing on the future of the human race.\nIn Guayaquil at the same moment that Bobby King reached home, *Zenji Hiroguchi was leaving his room at the Hotel El Dorado, angry with his pregnant wife. She had said unforgivable things about his motives in creating Gokubi and then Mandarax. He pressed the button for the elevator, and snapped his fingers and breathed very shallowly.\nAnd then out into the corridor came the person he least wanted to see, the cause of all his troubles as far as he was concerned, who was *Andrew MacIntosh.\n\u201cOh\u2014there you are,\u201d said *MacIntosh. \u201cI was just going to tell you that there is some sort of trouble with the telephones.

It was crucial to his plans that Sylvia not get pregnant by Eliot. A child in her womb would have an unbreakable claim to control of the Foundation, whether Eliot was crazy or not. And it was Mushari's dream that control should go to Eliot's second cousin, Fred Rosewater, in Pisquontuit, Rhode Island.\nFred knew nothing of this, didn't even know for certain that he was related to the Indiana Rosewaters. The Indiana Rosewaters knew about him only because McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee, being thorough, had hired a genealogist and a detective to find out who their closest relatives bearing the name Rosewater were. Fred's dossier in the law firm's confidential files was fat, as was Fred, but the investigation had been discreet. Fred never imagined that he might be tapped for wealth and glory.\nSo, on the morning after Eliot and Sylvia agreed to meet, Fred felt like an ordinary or less-than-ordinary man, whose prospects were poor. He came out of the Pisquontuit Drug Store, squinted in the sunlight, took three deep breaths, went into the Pisquontuit News Store next door. He was a portly man, aslop with coffee, gravid with Danish pastry.\nPoor, lugubrious Fred spent his mornings seeking insurance prospects in the drugstore, which was the coffee house of the rich, and the news store, which was the coffee house of the poor. He was the only man in town who had coffee in both places.\nFred bellied up to the news store's lunch counter, beamed at a carpenter and two plumbers sitting there. He climbed aboard a stool, and his great behind made the cushion seem no larger than a marshmallow.\n\"Coffee and Danish, Mr. Rosewater?\" said the not-very-clean idiot girl behind the counter.\n\"Coffee and Danish sounds real good,\" Fred agreed heartily. \"On a morning like this, by God, coffee and Danish sounds real good.\"\nAbout Pisquontuit: It was pronounced \"Pawn-it\" by those who loved it, and \"Piss-on-it\" by those who didn't. There had once been an Indian chief named Pisquontuit.\nPisquontuit wore an apron, lived, as did his people, on clams, raspberries, and rose hips. Agriculture was news to Chief Pisquontuit. So, for that matter, were wampum, feather ornaments, and the bow and arrow.\nAlcohol was the best news of all.

of Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-one. Fire had yet to be domesticated. Albert Einstein had predicted the invention of the wheel, but was unable to describe its probable shape and uses in the language of ordinary women and men. Herbert Hoover, a mining engineer, was President. The sale of alcoholic beverages was against the law, and I was a Harvard freshman.\nI was operating under instructions from my mentor, Alexander Hamilton McCone. He told me in a letter that I was to duplicate a folly he himself had committed when a freshman, which was to take a pretty girl to the Harvard-Columbia football game in New York, and then to spend a month\u2019s allowance on a lobster dinner for two, with oysters and caviar and all that, in the famous dining room of the Hotel Arapahoe. We were to go dancing afterward. \u201cYou must wear your tuxedo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must tip like a drunken sailor.\u201d Diamond Jim Brady, he told me, had once eaten four dozen oysters, four lobsters, four chickens, four squabs, four T-bone steaks, four pork chops, and four lamb chops there\u2014on a bet. Lillian Russell had looked on.\nMr. McCone may have been drunk when he wrote that letter. \u201cAll work and no play,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmakes Jack a dull boy.\u201d\nAnd the girl I took there, the twin sister of my roommate, would become one of the four women I would ever truly love. The first was my mother. The last was my wife.\nSarah Wyatt was the girl\u2019s name. She was all of eighteen, and so was I. She was attending a very easy two-year college for rich girls in Wellesley, Massachusetts, which was Pine Manor. Her family lived in Prides Crossing, north of Boston\u2014toward Gloucester. While we were in New York City together she would be staying with her maternal grandmother, a stockbroker\u2019s widow, in a queerly irrelevant enclave of dead-end streets and vest-pocket parks and Elizabethan apartment-hotels called \u201cTudor City\u201d\u2014near the East River, and actually bridging Forty-second Street. As luck will have it, my son now lives in Tudor City. So do Mr. and Mrs. Leland Clewes.\nSmall world.\nTudor City was quite new, but already bankrupt and nearly empty when I arrived by taxicab\u2014to take my Sarah to the Hotel Arapahoe in Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-one. I was wearing a tuxedo made to my measure by the finest tailor in Cleveland. I had a silver cigarette lighter and a silver cigarette case, both gifts from Mr. McCone. I had forty dollars in my billfold. I could have bought the whole state of Arkansas for forty dollars cash in Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-one.\nWe come to the matter of physical size again: Sarah Wyatt was three inches taller than me. She did not mind. She was so far from minding that, when I fetched her in Tudor City, she was wearing high heels with her evening dress.\nA stronger proof that she was indifferent to our disparity in size: In seven years Sarah Wyatt would agree to marry me.", 0.011073232323232318], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["wandering", 0.23069024814827271], ["immigrant", 0.15379349876551515], ["tunnels", 0.15379349876551515], ["vision", 0.15379349876551515], ["wrong", 0.1053675671647569], ["pay", 0.09440905072940112], ["angel", 0.09156146922513554], ["land", 0.09156146922513554], ["americanized", 0.07689674938275758], ["screwy", 0.07689674938275758], ["smallpox", 0.07689674938275758], ["unity", 0.07689674938275758], ["womankind", 0.07689674938275758], ["nudged", 0.07689674938275758], ["descendants", 0.07689674938275758], ["robbed", 0.07689674938275758], ["transformed", 0.07689674938275758], ["thompson", 0.07689674938275758], ["jones", 0.07689674938275758], ["cash", 0.07689674938275758], ["west", 0.07689674938275758], ["cent", 0.06752989559140696], ["momentarily", 0.06752989559140696], ["leading", 0.06752989559140696], ["directions", 0.06752989559140696], ["35", 0.06752989559140696], ["toe", 0.06752989559140696], ["ordered", 0.06205063737372907], ["boughs", 0.06205063737372907], ["ceiling", 0.06205063737372907], ["mouths", 0.06205063737372907], ["letters", 0.05816304180005636], ["pedestal", 0.05816304180005636], ["indiana", 0.05816304180005636], ["nope", 0.055147588403918375], ["bought", 0.055147588403918375], ["grandfather", 0.055147588403918375], ["german", 0.050600666287415504], ["marvin", 0.050600666287415504], ["murmured", 0.050600666287415504], ["time", 0.04916644441665323], ["moved", 0.048796188008705735], ["expect", 0.048796188008705735], ["paid", 0.048796188008705735], ["second", 0.04720452536470056], ["walls", 0.04720452536470056], ["raised", 0.04578073461256777], ["mankind", 0.04578073461256777], ["practically", 0.04449275920980662], ["written", 0.04123381249606489], ["story", 0.04030147639488987], ["black", 0.03942933421735512], ["floor", 0.03861008257118709], ["room", 0.03641388082121715], ["ilium", 0.035125905418456005], ["died", 0.035125905418456005], ["great", 0.03452520592425556], ["left", 0.03452520592425556], ["wife", 0.033950075999677226], ["bokononist", 0.03235841335567205], ["children", 0.031866958704714274], ["breed", 0.028100561374051838], ["people", 0.01686092159234789], ["asked", 0.01593918848388122]], "sentiment": ["\u201cIt was never paid for. The way the story goes: this German immigrant was on his way West with his wife, and she died of smallpox here in Ilium.

The guides were armed, and their main job was to see that no one got close enough to vital controls to knock them out. The system was a holdover from the war, and from the postwar riot period, but it still made sense. Every so often, antisabotage laws notwithstanding, someone got it into his head to jimmy something. It hadn\u2019t happened in Ilium for years, but Paul had heard reports from other works\u2014reports of a visitor with a crude bomb in a briefcase in Syracuse; of an old lady in Buffalo stepping from a group of sightseers to jam her umbrella into some vital clockwork\u2026. Things like that still happened, and Kroner had stipulated that visitors to plants should be watched every second. The saboteurs had come from every walk of life\u2014including, in at least one hushed-up instance, the brass. As Kroner had said, you never could tell who was going to try it next.\n\u201cOh, what the hell, let Finnerty in without an escort,\u201d said Paul. \u201cHe\u2019s a special case\u2014an old Ilium man.\u201d\n\u201cThe directive said no exceptions,\u201d said Katharine.

tuberculosis.\nCough, cough, cough.\nBEFORE I COULD protest to the Trustees that I certainly wouldn\u2019t have said what I\u2019d said about Yen and fellatio if I\u2019d thought there was the slightest chance that a student could hear me, the background noises on the tape changed. I realized that I was about to hear something I had said in a different location. There was the pop-pop-pop of Ping-Pong balls, and a card player asked, \u201cWho dealt this mess?\u201d Somebody else asked somebody else to bring her a hot fudge sundae without nuts on top. She was on a diet, she said. There were rumblings like distant artillery, which were really the sound of bowling balls in the basement of the Pahlavi Pavilion.\nOh Lordy, was I ever drunk that night at the Pavilion. I was out of control. And it was a disgrace that I should have appeared before students in such a condition. I will regret it to my dying day. Cough.\nIT WAS ON a cold night near the end of November of 1990, 6 months before the Trustees fired me. I know it wasn\u2019t December, because Slazinger was still on campus, talking openly of suicide. He hadn\u2019t yet received his Genius Grant.\nWhen I came home from work that afternoon, to tidy up the house and make supper, I found an awful mess. Margaret and Mildred, both hags by then, had torn bedsheets into strips. I had laundered the sheets that morning, and was going to put them on our beds that night. What did they care?\nThey had constructed what they said was a spider web. At least it wasn\u2019t a hydrogen bomb.\nWhite cotton strips spliced end to end crisscrossed every which way in the front hall and living room. The newel post of the stairway was connected to the inside doorknob of the front door, and the doorknob was connected to the living room chandelier, and so on ad infinitum.\nTHE DAY HADN\u2019T begun auspiciously anyway. I had found all 4 tires of my Mercedes flat. A bunch of high school kids from down below, high on alcohol or who knows what, had come up during the night like Vietcong and gone what they called \u201ccoring\u201d again. They not only had let the air out of the tires of every expensive car they could find in the open on campus, Porsches and Jaguars and Saabs and BMWs and so on, but had taken out the valve cores. At home, I had heard, they had jars full of valve cores or necklaces of valve cores to prove how often they had gone coring. And they got my Mercedes. They got my Mercedes every time.\nSO WHEN I found myself tangled in Margaret and Mildred\u2019s spider web, my nervous system came close to the breaking point. I was the one who was going to have to clean up this mess. I was the one who was going to have to remake the beds with other sheets, and then buy more sheets the next day. I have always liked housework, or at least not minded it as much as most people seem to.

He shaped it into a story, which he never got around to writing until he was an old, old man. It was about a planet where the language kept turning into pure music, because the creatures there were so enchanted by sounds. Words became musical notes. Sentences became melodies. They were useless as conveyors of information, because nobody knew or cared what the meanings of words were anymore.\nSo leaders in government and commerce, in order to function, had to invent new and much uglier vocabularies and sentence structures all the time, which would resist being transmuted to music.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cYou married, Kilgore?\u201d the driver asked.\n\u201cThree times,\u201d said Trout.
