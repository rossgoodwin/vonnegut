There was no fire on Santa Rosalia. After that came a fish stolen from a bird. After that came a bird itself. After that came the green pulp from inside a marine iguana.\nNature, in fact, was so bountiful that there was a reserve supply of food, of which the colonists were aware, but to which they never had to turn. There were seals and sea lions of all ages, none of them suspicious or ferocious, save for the males at mating time, lolling everywhere, making goo-goo eyes at passing human beings. They were edible as hell.\nIt just might have been fatal that the colonists killed off all the land iguanas almost immediately\u2014but it turned out not to have been a disaster. It could have mattered a lot. It just happened that it didn\u2019t matter much at all. There have never been great land tortoises on Santa Rosalia, or the colonists probably would have exterminated them as well. But that wouldn\u2019t have mattered either.\nMeanwhile, in other parts of the world, particularly in Africa, people were dying by the millions because they were unlucky. It hadn\u2019t rained for years and years. It used to rain a lot there, but now it looked as though it might never rain again.\nAt least the Africans had stopped reproducing. That much was good. That was some help. That meant that there was that much more of nothing to be spread around.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe Captain did not realize that any of the Kanka-bono women were pregnant until a month before the first one of them gave birth\u2014gave birth, as it happened, to the first human male native to the island, who came to be known by the nickname the furry Akiko gave him, expressing her delight in his maleness, which was \u201cKamikaze,\u201d Japanese for \u201csacred wind.\u201d\nThe original colonists never became a family which included everyone. Subsequent generations, though, after the last of the old people died, would become a family which included everyone. It had a common language and a common religion and some common jokes and songs and dances and so on, almost everything Kanka-bono. And Kamikaze, when it was his turn to be an old, old man, became something the Captain had never been, which was a venerated patriarch. And Akiko became a venerated matriarch.\nIt went very fast\u2014that formation from such random genetic materials of a perfectly cohesive human family. That was so nice to see. It almost made me love people just as they were back then, big brains and all.\n11", 0.1493421052631579], "title": "Galapagos"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["suite", 0.07347356756155832],

["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nKilgore Trout had to change into his only other garments, his high school tuxedo and his new evening shirt and all, right away. The lower parts of his rolled-up trousers had become impregnated with the plastic substance from the creek, so he couldn\u2019t roll them down again. They were as stiff as flanges on sewer pipes.\nSo Milo Maritimo showed him to his suite, which was two ordinary Holiday Inn rooms with a door between them open. Trout and every distinguished visitor had a suite, with two color television sets, two tile baths, four double beds equipped with Magic Fingers. Magic Fingers were electric vibrators attached to the mattress springs of a bed. If a guest put a quarter into a little box on his bedside table, the Magic Fingers would jiggle his bed.\nThere were enough flowers in Trout\u2019s room for a Catholic gangster\u2019s funeral. They were from Fred T. Barry, the Chairman of the Arts Festival, and from the Midland City Association of Women\u2019s Clubs, and from the Chamber of Commerce, and on and on.\nTrout read a few of the cards on the flowers, and he commented, \u201cThe town certainly seems to be getting behind the arts in a great big way.\u201d\nMilo closed his olive eyes tight, wincing with a tangy agony. \u201cIt\u2019s time. Oh God, Mr. Trout, we were starving for so long, without even knowing what we were hungering for,\u201d he said. This young man was not only a descendant of master criminals, he was a close relative of felons operating in Midland City at the present time. The partners in the Maritimo Brothers Construction Company, for instance, were his uncles. Gino Maritimo, Milo\u2019s first cousin once removed, was the dope king of the city.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cOh, Mr. Trout,\u201d nice Milo went on, there in Trout\u2019s suite, \u201cteach us to sing and dance and laugh and cry. We\u2019ve tried to survive so long on money and sex and envy and real estate and football and basketball and automobiles and television and alcohol\u2014on sawdust and broken glass!\u201d\n\u201cOpen your eyes!\u201d said Trout bitterly. \u201cDo I look like a dancer, a singer, a man of joy?\u201d He was wearing his tuxedo now. It was a size too large for him. He had lost much weight since high school. His pockets were crammed with mothballs. They bulged like saddlebags.\n\u201cOpen your eyes!\u201d said Trout. \u201cWould a man nourished by beauty look like this? You have nothing but desolation and desperation here, you say?

"sentiment": ["What was the dirtiest story I ever wrote? Surely \u201cThe Big Space Fuck,\u201d the first story in the history of literature to have \u201cfuck\u201d in its tide. It was probably the last short story I will ever write. I did it for my friend Har\u00edan Ellison, who printed it in his anthology Again, Dangerous Visions. It was copyrighted by him in 1972, and appears here with his kind permission. It goes like this:\nTHE BIG SPACE FUCK\nIn 1987 it became possible in the United States of America for a young person to sue his parents for the way he had been raised. He could take them to court and make them pay money and even serve jail terms for serious mistakes they made when he was just a helpless little kid. This was not only an effort to achieve justice but to discourage reproduction, since there wasn\u2019t anything much to eat any more. Abortions were free. In fact, any woman who volunteered for one got her choice of a bathroom scale or a table lamp.\nIn 1989, America staged the Big Space Fuck, which was a serious effort to make sure that human life would continue to exist somewhere in the Universe, since it certainly couldn\u2019t continue much longer on Earth. Everything had turned to shit and beer cans and old automobiles and Clorox bottles. An interesting thing happened in the Hawaiian Islands, where they had been throwing trash down extinct volcanoes for years: a couple of the volcanoes all of a sudden spit it all back up. And so on.\nThis was a period of great permissiveness in matters of language, so even the President was saying shit and fuck and so on, without anybody\u2019s feeling threatened or taking offense. It was perfectly OK. He called the Space Fuck a Space Fuck and so did everybody else. It was a rocket ship with eight hundred pounds of freeze-dried jizzum in its nose. It was going to be fired at the Andromeda Galaxy, two-million light years away. The ship was named the Arthur C. Clarke, in honor of a famous space pioneer.\nIt was to be fired at midnight on the Fourth of July. At ten o\u2019clock that night, Dwayne Hoobler and his wife Grace were watching the countdown on television in the living room of their modest home in Elk Harbor, Ohio, on the shore of what used to be Lake Erie. Lake Erie was almost solid sewage now. There were man-eating lampreys in there thirty-eight feet long. Dwayne was a guard in the Ohio Adult Correctional Institution, which was two miles away. His hobby was making birdhouses out of Clorox bottles. He went on making them and hanging them around his yard, even though there weren\u2019t any birds any more.\nDwayne and Grace marveled at a film demonstration of how jizzum had been freeze-dried for the trip. A small beaker of the stuff, which had been contributed by the head of the Mathematics Department at the University of Chicago, was flash-frozen. Then it was placed under a bell jar, and the air was exhausted from the jar. The air evanesced, leaving a fine white powder. The powder certainly didn\u2019t look like much, and Dwayne Hoobler said so\u2014but there were several hundred million sperm cells in there, in suspended animation. The original contribution, an average contribution, had been two cubic centimeters. There was enough powder, Dwayne estimated out loud, to clog the eye of a needle. And eight-hundred pounds of the stuff would soon be on its way to Andromeda.\n\u201cFuck you, Andromeda,\u201d said Dwayne, and he wasn\u2019t being coarse. He was echoing billboards and stickers all over town. Other signs said, \u201cAndromeda, We Love You,\u201d and \u201cEarth Has the Hots for Andromeda,\u201d and so on.\nThere was a knock on the door, and an old friend of the family, the County Sheriff, simultaneously let himself in. \u201cHow are you, you old motherfucker?\u201d said Dwayne.\n\u201cCan\u2019t complain, shitface,\u201d said the sheriff, and they joshed back and forth like that for a while. Grace chuckled, enjoying their wit. She wouldn\u2019t have chuckled so richly, however, if she had been a little more observant. She might have noticed that the sheriff\u2019s jocularity was very much on the surface. Underneath, he had something troubling on his mind. She might have noticed, too, that he had legal papers in his hand.", 0.07584080975385324], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["tetanus", 0.13044234859045986], ["chung", 0.09564337724336631], ["trap", 0.07945295261385908], ["doctors", 0.07945295261385908], ["foreigners", 0.06376225149557754], ["ruling", 0.06376225149557754], ["hostages", 0.0537808348153426], ["avarice", 0.04989881231311575], ["immunized", 0.04989881231311575], ["nincompoops", 0.04989881231311575], ["borrow", 0.04989881231311575], ["madam", 0.04989881231311575], ["imply", 0.04989881231311575], ["nightmare", 0.04989881231311575], ["pioneer", 0.04989881231311575], ["nationality", 0.04989881231311575], ["wonderingly", 0.04989881231311575], ["distinct", 0.04989881231311575], ["clever", 0.04989881231311575], ["understandable", 0.04989881231311575], ["invest", 0.04989881231311575], ["echoed", 0.04989881231311575], ["public", 0.04627222170222845], ["treasuries", 0.043480782863486625], ["burn", 0.043480782863486625], ["fallen", 0.043480782863486625], ["impression", 0.043480782863486625], ["responsibilities", 0.043480782863486625], ["ronald", 0.043480782863486625], ["comatose", 0.043480782863486625], ["corporate", 0.043480782863486625], ["industries", 0.03972647630692954], ["regarded", 0.03972647630692954], ["choice", 0.03972647630692954], ["apart", 0.03972647630692954], ["countries", 0.03972647630692954], ["misfortune", 0.03972647630692954], ["looted", 0.03972647630692954], ["stick", 0.03972647630692954], ["programs", 0.03972647630692954], ["interested", 0.03972647630692954], ["grow", 0.03972647630692954], ["died", 0.039462503551759606], ["bury", 0.0370627534138575], ["reagan", 0.0370627534138575], ["remain", 0.0370627534138575], ["class", 0.03561733012994026], ["heavily", 0.03499660942020741], ["occupation", 0.03499660942020741], ["suits", 0.03499660942020741], ["health", 0.03499660942020741], ["cases", 0.03499660942020741], ["dreams", 0.033308446857300424], ["lowell", 0.03188112574778877], ["male", 0.03188112574778877], ["atomic", 0.030644723964228376], ["send", 0.030644723964228376], ["wealth", 0.030644723964228376], ["wonder", 0.029554140300743343], ["turning", 0.029554140300743343], ["country", 0.028896858024581588], ["rich", 0.027696078305723428], ["practically", 0.027696078305723428], ["killing", 0.0268904174076713], ["paid", 0.0268904174076713], ["understand", 0.026149281225508927], ["government", 0.025463096298159647], ["hard", 0.025463096298159647], ["americans", 0.025463096298159647], ["bomb", 0.02482427341402121], ["bodies", 0.02482427341402121], ["number", 0.02366535542370634], ["running", 0.02366535542370634], ["jason", 0.023136110851114226], ["pretty", 0.023136110851114226], ["days", 0.022635488431945], ["case", 0.021708789741602574], ["turned", 0.020472387958042175], ["stable", 0.019731251775879803], ["children", 0.019381804294557145], ["wilder", 0.019381804294557145], ["call", 0.019381804294557145], ["rest", 0.018406243964392086], ["set", 0.018406243964392086], ["business", 0.018406243964392086], ["army", 0.018102634493808837], ["president", 0.018102634493808837], ["point", 0.01780866506497013], ["trustees", 0.016464387196039595], ["white", 0.016464387196039595], ["things", 0.016464387196039595], ["great", 0.015742521071320043], ["mother", 0.011988214514762965], ["thought", 0.010172336006186201], ["told", 0.008441989956836059]], "sentiment": ["\u201cAll anybody can do with bodies is burn them or bury them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any nightmare afterwards, when you have to invest them and make them grow.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT A CLEVER trap your Ruling Class set for us,\u201d he went on. \u201cFirst the atomic bomb.
