We try to run a class operation here, but fail more often than not. The luckiest thing I ever did was to teach at Iowa for those two years. I picked up a very classy extended family that way. It made you and John and John and John and some others quality relatives of mine for life. I used to be in this trade all alone. Suddenly, I was a member of a really great gang. I never tire of asking you and the rest, \u201cHow goes it?\u201d If you are ever in trouble, I will take you in.\nI have stopped drinking. The only drawback seems to be that I can\u2019t dance like Fred Astaire any more. When I dance now, it feels like trying to dock somebody else\u2019s boat in a rainstorm.\nA couple of talented young nobodies have turned God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater into a perfectly darling musical. It showcased last spring in a 99-seat theater. Now it is in rehearsal for a big-time production ($400,000!), and will open on October 14, after three weeks or so of previews. There is a chance that Robert might even find something to admire in the music. At any rate, I would love to give you two a couple of good tickets the next time you\u2019re in town, and we can all have supper afterwards. The producer is my daughter Edith, the painter, who turns out to have a whiz-bang mind for business. She hopes to make enough to buy a loft. She paints very big in a tiny room on Ninth Street these days. Did you ever see her stuff? She\u2019s a very convincing pre-Raphaelite.\nHow goes it?\nLove\u2014\nKurt\nSeptember 21, 1979\nNew York City", 0.2286545454545455], "title": "Letters"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["laugh", 0.13599767389869785], ["laughing", 0.10009453705125977], ["touched", 0.0949051521369758], ["alive", 0.08397483517777266], ["hazel", 0.08352985773208366], ["finger", 0.08123569481367073], ["answer", 0.06644525837832196], ["verge", 0.06616697039911698], ["strolling", 0.06616697039911698], ["paused", 0.06616697039911698], ["advising", 0.06616697039911698], ["raw", 0.06616697039911698], ["lazily", 0.06616697039911698], ["bitterly", 0.06616697039911698], ["stumbled", 0.06616697039911698], ["startlingly", 0.06616697039911698], ["strikes", 0.06616697039911698], ["petrified", 0.06616697039911698], ["solves", 0.06616697039911698], ["depressed", 0.06616697039911698], ["coaxed", 0.06616697039911698], ["quick", 0.06616697039911698], ["midway", 0.06616697039911698], ["cried", 0.06266574839000161], ["playfully", 0.05810711946237342], ["gall", 0.05810711946237342], ["worthless", 0.05810711946237342], ["joy", 0.05810711946237342], ["spared", 0.05810711946237342], ["weep", 0.05810711946237342], ["worry", 0.05810711946237342], ["laughter", 0.05810711946237342], ["slope", 0.053392408902976175], ["road", 0.053392408902976175], ["taxicab", 0.053392408902976175], ["advice", 0.053392408902976175], ["mildly", 0.053392408902976175], ["deep", 0.050047268525629886], ["thousands", 0.050047268525629886], ["storm", 0.050047268525629886], ["straightened", 0.050047268525629886], ["called", 0.04835910562046129], ["angry", 0.0474525760684879], ["ground", 0.04533255796623262], ["arm", 0.04533255796623262], ["newton", 0.043540108200799385], ["crying", 0.043540108200799385], ["passed", 0.043540108200799385], ["minute", 0.043540108200799385], ["kill", 0.04061784740683536], ["arms", 0.04061784740683536], ["cab", 0.04061784740683536], ["fact", 0.04061784740683536], ["mona", 0.040001570715626475], ["raised", 0.039392725131744355], ["simple", 0.039392725131744355], ["lips", 0.039392725131744355], ["mom", 0.039392725131744355], ["simply", 0.039392725131744355], ["half", 0.03727270702948907], ["funny", 0.03634197787049446], ["bolivar", 0.035480257264055834], ["faced", 0.035480257264055834], ["died", 0.030224616290299353], ["heard", 0.02970773533017338], ["better", 0.02970773533017338], ["lowe", 0.029212856092745522], ["knew", 0.025867715715399232], ["crosby", 0.02482571387017031], ["wasn", 0.022985899856043636], ["thing", 0.01957007289641383], ["hoenikker", 0.017990985208517763], ["people", 0.014508234858531905], ["man", 0.012735344234761282]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI do not see him,\u201d said Mona mildly.

Answer me quickly.\n\u201cNot quick enough with your answer,\u201d she called playfully, after half a minute had passed. And, still laughing a little, she touched her finger to the ground, straightened up, and touched the finger to her lips and died.\nDid I weep? They say I did. H. Lowe Crosby and his Hazel and little Newton Hoenikker came upon me as I stumbled down the road. They were in Bolivar\u2019s one taxicab, which had been spared by the storm. They tell me I was crying. Hazel cried, too, cried for joy that I was alive.\nThey coaxed me into the cab.\nHazel put her arm around me. \u201cYou\u2019re with your mom, now.

["UNREADY TO WEAR\nI DON\u2019T SUPPOSE the oldsters, those of us who weren\u2019t born into it, will ever feel quite at home being amphibious\u2014 amphibious in the new sense of the word. I still catch myself feeling blue about things that don\u2019t matter any more.\nI can\u2019t help worrying about my business, for instance\u2014or what used to be my business. After all, I spent thirty years building the thing up from scratch, and now the equipment is rusting and getting clogged with dirt. But even though I know it\u2019s silly of me to care what happens to the business, I borrow a body from a storage center every so often, and go around the old hometown, and clean and oil as much of the equipment as I can.\nOf course, all in the world the equipment was good for was making money, and Lord knows there\u2019s plenty of that lying around. Not as much as there used to be, because there at first some people got frisky and threw it all around, and the wind blew it every which way. And a lot of go-getters gathered up piles of the stuff and hid it somewhere. I hate to admit it, but I gathered up close to a half million myself and stuck it away. I used to get it out and count it sometimes, but that was years ago. Right now I\u2019d be hard put to say where it is.\nBut the worrying I do about my old business is bush league stuff compared to the worrying my wife, Madge, does about our old house. That thing is what she herself put in thirty years on while I was building the business. Then no sooner had we gotten nerve enough to build and decorate the place than everybody we cared anything about got amphibious. Madge borrows a body once a month and dusts the place, though the only thing a house is good for now is keeping termites and mice from getting pneumonia.\nWhenever it\u2019s my turn to get into a body and work as an attendant at the local storage center, I realize all over again how much tougher it is for women to get used to being amphibious.\nMadge borrows bodies a lot oftener than I do, and that\u2019s true of women in general. We have to keep three times as many women\u2019s bodies in stock as men\u2019s bodies, in order to meet the demand. Every so often, it seems as though a woman just has to have a body, and doll it up in clothes, and look at herself in a mirror. And Madge, God bless her, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be satisfied until she\u2019s tried on every body in every storage center on Earth.\nIt\u2019s been a fine thing for Madge, though. I never kid her about it, because it\u2019s done so much for her personality. Her old body, to tell you the plain blunt truth, wasn\u2019t anything to get excited about, and having to haul the thing around made her gloomy a lot of the time in the old days. She couldn\u2019t help it, poor soul, any more than anybody else could help what sort of body they\u2019d been born with, and I loved her in spite of it.\nWell, after we\u2019d learned to be amphibious, and after we\u2019d built the storage centers and laid in body supplies and opened them to the public, Madge went hog wild. She borrowed a platinum blonde body that had been donated by a burlesque queen, and I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever get her out of it. As I say, it did wonders for her self-confidence.\nI\u2019m like most men and don\u2019t care particularly what body I get. Just the strong, good-looking, healthy bodies were put in storage, so one is as good as the next one. Sometimes, when Madge and I take bodies out together for old times\u2019 sake, I let her pick out one for me to match whatever she\u2019s got on.
