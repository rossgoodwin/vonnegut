stout-hearted men\u2019s evening at the Kroner\u2019s, Doctor Paul Proteus, son of a successful man, himself rich with prospects of being richer, counted his material blessings. He found that he was in excellent shape to afford integrity. He was worth, without having to work another day in his life, almost three-quarters of a million dollars.\nFor once, his dissatisfaction with his life was specific. He was reacting to an outrage that would be regarded as such by almost any man in any period in history. He had been told to turn informer on his friend, Ed Finnerty. This was about as basic as an attack on integrity could be, and Paul received it with the same sort of relief that was felt when the first shots of the last war were fired\u2014after decades of tension.\nNow he could damn well lose his temper and quit.\nAnita slept\u2014utterly satisfied, not so much by Paul as by the social orgasm of, after years of the system\u2019s love play, being offered Pittsburgh.\nShe had delivered a monologue on the way home from Albany\u2014a recitation that might have come from Shepherd. She\u2019d reviewed Paul\u2019s career from the instant of their marriage onward, and Paul was surprised to learn that his path was strewn with bodies\u2014men who had tried to best him, only to be chagrined and ruined.\nShe made the carnage so vivid that he was obliged for a moment to abandon his own thoughts, to see if there was the slightest truth in what she was saying. He went over the scalps she was counting one by one\u2014men who had competed with him for this job or that\u2014and found that they all had done well for themselves and were quite unbroken either financially or in spirit. But to Anita they were dead men, shot squarely between the eyes, and good riddance of bad rubbish.\nPaul hadn\u2019t told Anita the conditions he would have to meet before he could have Pittsburgh. And he didn\u2019t intimate that he was going to do anything but take the job proudly, joyfully.\nNow, lying beside her, he congratulated himself on his calm, on his being wily for the first time in his life, really. He wasn\u2019t going to tell Anita that he was quitting for a long time, not until she was ready. He would subtly re-educate her to a new set of values, and then quit. Otherwise the shock of being the wife of a nobody might do tragic things. The only grounds on which she met the world were those of her husband\u2019s rank. If he were to lose the rank it was frighteningly possible that she would lose touch with the world altogether, or, worse for Paul, leave him.\nAnd Paul didn\u2019t want either of those things to happen. She was what fate had given him to love, and he did his best to love her.

inedible. Two years would pass before their discovery that partially digested seaweed in the bellies of these creatures was not only a tasty hot meal, ready cooked, but a cure for vitamin and mineral deficiencies which had troubled them up to then. That would complete their diet. Some people, moreover, could digest this pur\u00e9e better than others, so that they were healthier and nicer looking\u2014more desirable as sexual partners. So the Law of Natural Selection went to work, with the result, a million years later, that human beings can now digest seaweed for themselves, without the intervention of marine iguanas, which they leave alone.\nThat is such a much nicer arrangement for everyone.\nPeople still kill fish, though, and, in times of fish shortages, they will still eat boobies, who still aren\u2019t afraid of them.\nI could stay here another million years, and that still wouldn\u2019t be time enough, I\u2019m sure, for the boobies to realize that people are dangerous. Yes, and as I\u2019ve already said, they still dance and dance at mating time.\nThe people had quite a feast on the Bah\u00eda de Darwin that night. They ate on the sun deck, and the deck itself was the serving platter, and the Captain was the chef. There were roasted land iguanas stuffed with crabmeat and minced finches. There were roasted boobies stuffed with their own eggs and basted with melted penguin fat. It was perfectly delicious. Everybody was happy again.\nAnd at first light the next morning, the Captain and Mary went ashore again, and took the Kanka-bono girls along. The girls could finally understand something which was going on. They all killed and killed, and hauled corpses and hauled corpses, until the ship\u2019s freezer contained, in addition to James Wait, enough birds and iguanas and eggs to last for a month, if necessary. Now they had not only plenty of fuel and water, but no end of food, and good food, too, as well.\nNext the Captain would start the engines. He would head the ship due east at maximum velocity. There was no way he could miss South America or Central America or North America, the Captain told Mary, his sense of humor returning, \u201c\u2026 unless we are unlucky enough to pass through the Panama Canal. But if we do go through the canal, I can virtually guarantee you that we will be in Europe or Africa by and by.\u201d\nSo he laughed, and she laughed. Everything was going to be all right after all. But then the engines wouldn\u2019t start.\n9\nBY THE TIME the Bah\u00eda de Darwin slid beneath the dead calm ocean, which was in September of 1996, everybody but the Captain was calling her by a nickname given to her by Mary, which was \u201cthe Walloping Window Blind.\u201d", 0.15283882783882782], "title": "Galapagos"}, "god-bless-you-mr-rosewater": {"tfidf": [["trout", 0.24221464066223852], ["birdbath", 0.10464635596225572], ["grabbed", 0.06976423730817048], ["beard", 0.06976423730817048], ["understood", 0.06471718340550765], ["stranger", 0.05760376045624161], ["simple", 0.05255670655357878], ["investigator", 0.05049033750697557], ["gingerly", 0.044519068554682684], ["scott", 0.044519068554682684], ["emaciated", 0.044519068554682684], ["quaint", 0.044519068554682684], ["betray", 0.044519068554682684], ["feverish", 0.044519068554682684], ["smartest", 0.044519068554682684], ["affectionately", 0.044519068554682684], ["bookjackets", 0.044519068554682684], ["precariously", 0.044519068554682684], ["calculation", 0.044519068554682684], ["careful", 0.044519068554682684], ["exclaimed", 0.044519068554682684], ["pedestal", 0.044519068554682684], ["evidently", 0.044519068554682684], ["fitzgerald", 0.044519068554682684], ["appreciate", 0.044519068554682684], ["lost", 0.03933263984522124], ["lose", 0.03843883012871825], ["falling", 0.03843883012871825], ["retrieved", 0.03843883012871825], ["blackness", 0.03843883012871825], ["reflected", 0.03843883012871825], ["balanced", 0.03843883012871825], ["support", 0.03843883012871825], ["startled", 0.03843883012871825], ["momentarily", 0.03843883012871825], ["dropped", 0.03843883012871825], ["detail", 0.03843883012871825], ["calling", 0.03488211865408524], ["address", 0.03488211865408524], ["ordered", 0.03488211865408524], ["aged", 0.03488211865408524], ["explain", 0.032358591702753826], ["fountain", 0.032358591702753826], ["change", 0.032358591702753826], ["noticed", 0.032358591702753826], ["calm", 0.032358591702753826], ["meaning", 0.032358591702753826], ["bring", 0.03040119212982216], ["sitting", 0.03040119212982216], ["rolled", 0.03040119212982216], ["balance", 0.03040119212982216], ["recognize", 0.03040119212982216], ["told", 0.02996277167100619], ["middle", 0.028801880228120805], ["rim", 0.028801880228120805], ["tomorrow", 0.02744968128226766], ["senator", 0.02670344222861599], ["cry", 0.02627835327678939], ["reached", 0.02627835327678939], ["began", 0.02432095370385773], ["reason", 0.02348489949504786], ["deep", 0.02348489949504786], ["god", 0.023464985911411555], ["live", 0.022721641802156373], ["voice", 0.022019512787476228], ["eliot", 0.02167024848009262], ["sick", 0.02136944285630323], ["rich", 0.01966631992261062], ["doctor", 0.01966631992261062], ["crazy", 0.01916493032752335], ["water", 0.018240715277893296], ["times", 0.018240715277893296], ["hands", 0.01781273138167021], ["turned", 0.01781273138167021], ["heard", 0.01740466106908343], ["year", 0.01701473332723401], ["couldn", 0.01701473332723401], ["boy", 0.015939274361511796], ["day", 0.014981385835503095], ["thought", 0.014396373778497198], ["sylvia", 0.012160476851928864], ["father", 0.011324422643118998], ["thing", 0.010934494901269578], ["will", 0.01074584397827867], ["time", 0.00875119623972024], ["rosewater", 0.0049501255150612]], "sentiment": ["And Eliot might have reflected on this quaint ending and beginning for Sylvia, had he not heard his father address the old stranger affectionately as \"Mr. Trout.\"\n\"Trout!\" Eliot exclaimed. He was so startled that he momentarily lost his balance, grabbed the birdbath for support. The birdbath was so precariously balanced on its pedestal that it began to tip. Eliot dropped The Investigator, grabbed the birdbath with both hands to keep it from falling. And he saw himself in the water. Looking up at him was an emaciated, feverish, middle-aged boy.\n\"My God,\" he thought to himself, \"F. Scott Fitzgerald, with one day to live.\"\nHe was careful not to cry out Trout's name again as he turned around. He understood that this might betray how sick he was, understood that he and Trout had evidently gotten to know each other during all the blackness. Eliot did not recognize him for the simple reason that all of Trout's bookjackets showed him with a beard. The stranger had no beard.\n\"By God, Eliot,\" said the Senator, \"when you told me to bring Trout here, I told the Doctor you were still crazy. You said Trout could explain the meaning of everything you'd done in Rosewater, even if you couldn't. But I was willing to try anything, and calling him in is the smartest thing I ever did.\"\n\"Right,\" said Eliot, sitting gingerly on the fountain's rim again. He reached behind himself, retrieved The Investigator. He rolled it up, noticed the date on it for the first time. He made a calm calculation.

inoperative. It didn\u2019t even exist anymore. The elevator, the paneling, the ornate light fixtures, and everything remotely valuable had been stripped from the mansion years before Weems took it over. But Weems invited his guests, even as their feet crunched broken plaster on bare floors, to admire the immaculate and lavish decor.\n\u201cThis is the gold room, and this is the blue room,\u201d he said. \u201cThe white swan bed in the blue room is said to have belonged to Madame Pompadour, believe it or not. Do you believe that?\u201d he said to Foltz.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t prove it by me,\u201d said Foltz.\n\u201cWho can be sure of anything in this world, eh?\u201d said Weems.\nCarney repeated this sentiment word for word. \u201cWho can be sure of anything in this world, eh?\u201d he said.\n\u201cHere is the staircase to the ballroom,\u201d said Weems. The staircase was broad. There was a pedestal at its base that had once supported a statue. The original banisters were gone, naked spikes showing where the uprights had once been moored. There was only one banister now, a length of pipe held by clinched nails. The bare steps were studded with carpet tacks. A tack here and there held a twist of red yarn.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent more money restoring this staircase than I\u2019ve spent on anything else in the house,\u201d said Weems. \u201cThe banisters I found in Italy. The statue, a fourteenth-century Saint Catherine from Toledo, I bought from the estate of William Randolph Hearst. This carpet we\u2019re walking on, gentlemen, was woven to my specifications in Kerman, Iran. It\u2019s like walking on a feather mattress, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nCarney and Foltz did not reply, there was so much splendor to appreciate. But they lifted their knees high, as though they were indeed walking on a feather mattress.\nWeems opened the ballroom door, a handsome door, actually. But its handsomeness was spoiled by a message whitewashed across its fac. keep out, said the sign. Two coat hangers hung from the doorknob, tinkled tinnily as Weems opened and closed the door.\nThe ballroom at the tower\u2019s top was circular. Around its walls, full-length mirrors alternated with ghastly leaded-glass windows of purple, mustard, and green.

No. Human dignity must be given by people to people. If you stand before me, and I do not credit you with dignity, then you have none. If I stand before you, and you do not credit me with dignity, then I have none. If Channing\u2019s parishioners felt that illiterate black slaves in the American South had negligible amounts of dignity, then those slaves would in fact be negligibly dignified\u2014like chimpanzees, perhaps.\n\u201cIt is easy to see dignity in relatives and friends. It is inevitable that we see it in relatives and friends. What is human dignity, then? It is the favorable opinion, respectful and uncritical, which we hold of those most familiar to us. It has been found that we can hold that same good opinion of strangers, if those who teach us and otherwise lead us tell us to.\n\u201cWhat could be more essential in a pluralistic society like ours than that every citizen see dignity in every other human being everywhere?\n\u201cAnd let us consider for a moment a society which was the exact opposite of what ours is supposed to be\u2014which was Hider\u2019s Germany. He trained a generation of warriors and police to be blind to human dignity, to never see it anywhere. So wherever he sent his warriors and police, there was no dignity. If he had conquered the world, there would have been no dignity anywhere. The penalty for crediting anyone with dignity in such a society? Death. And that, too, since there would be nobody to see dignity in it, would be undignified.\n\u201cPotter\u2019s field.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t God give dignity to everybody? No\u2014not in my opinion. Giving dignity, the sort of dignity that is of some earthly use, anyway, is something that only people do.\n\u201cOr fail to do.\n\u201cWhat happens if you credit a bum with human dignity\u2014a drunken bum with his pants full of shit and snot dangling from his nose? At least you haven\u2019t made yourself poorer in a financial sense. And he can\u2019t take whatever it is that you have given him and spend it on Thunderbird wine.\n\u201cThere is this drawback, though: If you give to that sort of a stranger the uncritical respect that you give to friends and relatives, you will also want to understand and help him.

Bonnie MacMahon.\nBonnie MacMahon blew up. This was the first time she had blown up since she had come to work in the cocktail lounge. Her voice became as unpleasant as the noise of a handsaw\u2019s cutting galvanized tin. It was loud, too. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d she said. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d\nEverybody froze. Bunny Hoover stopped playing the piano. Nobody wanted to miss a word.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think much of Mary Alice Miller?\u201d she said. \u201cWell, we don\u2019t think much of your painting. I\u2019ve seen better pictures done by a five-year-old.\u201d\nKarabekian slid off his barstool so he could face all those enemies standing up. He certainly surprised me. I expected him to retreat in a hail of olives, maraschino cherries and lemon rinds. But he was majestic up there \u201cListen\u2014\u201d he said so calmly, \u201cI have read the editorial against my painting in your wonderful newspaper. I have read every word of the hate mail you have been thoughtful enough to send to New York.\u201d\nThis embarrassed people some.\n\u201cThe painting did not exist until I made it,\u201d Karabekian went on. \u201cNow that it does exist, nothing would make me happier than to have it reproduced again and again, and vastly improved upon, by all the five-year-olds in town. I would love for your children to find pleasantly and playfully what it took me many angry years to find.\n\u201cI now give you my word of honor,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat the picture your city owns shows everything about life which truly matters, with nothing left out. It is a picture of the awareness of every animal. It is the immaterial core of every animal\u2014the \u2018I am\u2019 to which all messages are sent. It is all that is alive in any of us\u2014in a mouse, in a deer, in a cocktail waitress. It is unwavering and pure, no matter what preposterous adventure may befall us. A sacred picture of Saint Anthony alone is one vertical, unwavering band of light. If a cockroach were near him, or a cocktail waitress, the picture would show two such bands of light. Our awareness is all that is alive and maybe sacred in any of us. Everything else about us is dead machinery.\n\u201cI have just heard from this cocktail waitress here, this vertical band of light, a story about her husband and an idiot who was about to be executed at Shepherds town. Very well\u2014let a five-year-old paint a sacred interpretation of that encounter. Let that five-year-old strip away the idiocy, the bars, the waiting electric chair, the uniform of the guard, the gun of the guard, the bones and meat of the guard. What is that perfect picture which any five-year-old can paint? Two unwavering bands of light.\u201d\nEcstasy bloomed on the barbaric face of Rabo Karabekian. \u201cCitizens of Midland City, I salute you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have given a home to a masterpiece!\u201d", 0.15541125541125544], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["honest", 0.11050535747579149], ["robert", 0.10015562017071059], ["girl", 0.0901760920874966], ["set", 0.08705489433588698], ["jealous", 0.08518975795413133], ["nights", 0.08518975795413133], ["projector", 0.08518975795413133], ["grinding", 0.08518975795413133], ["thieves", 0.08518975795413133], ["recreate", 0.08518975795413133], ["sympathize", 0.08518975795413133], ["binges", 0.08518975795413133], ["rival", 0.08518975795413133], ["precedent", 0.08518975795413133], ["father", 0.08144500028068838], ["brought", 0.07978139347237219], ["mickey", 0.07452595517628602], ["friendly", 0.07452595517628602], ["wednesday", 0.07452595517628602], ["motion", 0.07452595517628602], ["emotional", 0.07452595517628602], ["talk", 0.06896915080043715], ["thick", 0.0638621523984407], ["stare", 0.0638621523984407], ["butler", 0.0638621523984407], ["snapped", 0.0638621523984407], ["cry", 0.057624227658315104], ["couch", 0.057624227658315104], ["lie", 0.057624227658315104], ["mouse", 0.055252678737895744], ["spirit", 0.055252678737895744], ["affectionate", 0.055252678737895744], ["ceiling", 0.055252678737895744], ["idea", 0.0513863029181895], ["eat", 0.04976537190806909], ["exactly", 0.04829906144954102], ["talked", 0.04696042488046979], ["dark", 0.04696042488046979], ["shoulder", 0.04696042488046979], ["sleep", 0.04352744716794349], ["hour", 0.04352744716794349], ["picture", 0.036951385401375186], ["days", 0.036951385401375186], ["wanted", 0.036951385401375186], ["talking", 0.036951385401375186], ["hard", 0.03629662210262448], ["sat", 0.03629662210262448], ["pretty", 0.03566859141769748], ["work", 0.03392507318220512], ["told", 0.03235918557743678], ["god", 0.0313973339315701], ["boy", 0.030938057575421157], ["called", 0.030938057575421157], ["room", 0.028437766352378466], ["thing", 0.02272140394572488], ["life", 0.019828292691833505]], "sentiment": ["\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d she said, \u201cfor a girl who\u2019s been brought up to be friendly and affectionate to tell.
