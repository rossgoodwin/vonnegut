He wanted to fly up so high because there was something going on at ground-zero that did not make him feel good. Four men in dark business suits were seated chockablock on a concrete bench only six feet away. There were staring at him hard, expecting something significant from him.

Eliot could not name him, and yet, in some way that did not disturb Eliot, the man's features, those of a kindly country undertaker, claimed him as a close friend, indeed.\n\"You can't find the words?\" Dr. Brown suggested.

translation.\n\u201cShe said you should marry a man next time,\u201d said Marilee.\n\u201cHer husband plunged her hands into boiling water,\u201d she said, \u201cin order to make her tell him who her lovers had been while he was away at war. They were Germans and then Americans, by the way, and gangrene set in.\u201d\nOver the fireplace of Marilee\u2019s cozy library was the Dan Gregory-style painting I mentioned earlier, a gift to her from the people of Florence: showing her late husband, Count Bruno, refusing a blindfold while facing a firing squad. She said that it hadn\u2019t happened exactly that way, but that nothing ever did. So I asked her how it happened that she became the Contessa Portomaggiore, with the beautiful palazzo and rich farms to the north and so on.\nWhen she and Gregory and Fred Jones arrived in Italy, she said, before the United States got into the war, and against Italy and Germany and Japan, they were received as great celebrities. They represented a propaganda victory for Mussolini: \u201c\u2018America\u2019s greatest living artist and one of its greatest aviators and the incomparably beautiful and gifted American actress, Marilee Kemp,\u2019 he called us,\u201d said Marilee. \u201cHe said the three of us had come to take part in the spiritual and physical and economic miracle in Italy, which would become the model for the world for thousands of years to come.\u201d\nThe propaganda value of the three of them was so great that she was accorded in the press and at social events the respect a real and famous actress deserved. \u201cSo suddenly I wasn\u2019t a dim-witted floozy anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a jewel in the crown of the new Roman emperor. Dan and Fred, I must say, found this confusing. They had no choice in public but to treat me more respectfully, and I had fun with that. This country is absolutely crazy about blondes, of course, so that, whenever we had to make an entrance, I came first\u2014and they came along behind me, as part of my entourage.\n\u201cAnd it was somehow very easy for me to learn Italian,\u201d she said. \u201cI was soon better at it than Dan, who\u2019d taken lessons in it back in New York. Fred, of course, never learned Italian at all.\u201d\nFred and Dan became heroes in Italy after they died fighting more or less for the Italian cause. Marilee\u2019s celebrity survived them\u2014as a very beautiful and charming reminder of their supreme sacrifice, and of the admiration many Americans had, supposedly, for Mussolini.\nShe was still certainly beautiful, by the way, at the time of our reunion, even without makeup and in widow\u2019s weeds. She should have been an old lady after all she had been through, but she was only forty-three. She had a third of a century still to go!\nAnd, as I say, she would become Europe\u2019s largest Sony distributor, among other things.

Any gifts we have should be given to creatures right on the surface of the planet, it seems to me. If God gets angry about that, we can call in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There\u2019s a very good chance they can calm Him down.\n\u201cThe new moral code we choose may already have martyrs. It is difficult to spot such things. One corpse tends to look pretty much like another one\u2014until the historians sort them out with the benefit of hindsight.\n\u201cWe shall see what we shall see.\n\u201cFor two thirds of my life I have been a pessimist. I am astonished to find myself an optimist now. I feel now that I have been underestimating the intelligence and resourcefulness of man. I honestly thought that we were so stupid that we would continue to tear the planet to pieces, to sell it to each other, to burn it up. I\u2019ve never expected thermonuclear war. What seemed certain to me was that we would simply gobble up the planet out of boredom and greed, not in centuries, but in ten or twenty years.\n\u201cKilgore Trout wrote a science-fiction story called \u2019The Planet Gobblers\u2019 one time. It was about us, and we were the terrors of the universe. We were sort of interplanetary termites. We would arrive on a planet, gobble it up, and die. But before we died, we always sent out spaceships to start tiny colonies elsewhere. We were a disease, since it was not necessary to inhabit planets with such horrifying destructiveness. It is easy to take good care of a planet.\n\u201cOur grandchildren will surely think of us as the Planet Gobblers. Poorer nations than America think of America as a Planet Gobbler right now. But that is going to change. There is welling up within us a willingness to say \u2019No, thank you\u2019 to our factories. We were once maniacs for possessions, imagining that they would somehow moderate or somehow compensate us for our loneliness.\n\u201cThe experiment has been tried in this most affluent nation in all of human history. Possessions help a little, but not as much as advertisers said they were supposed to, and we are now aware of how permanently the manufacture of some of those products hurts the planet.\n\u201cSo there is a willingness to do without them.\n\u201cThere is a willingness to do whatever we need to do in order to have life on the planet go on for a long, long time. I didn\u2019t used to think that. And that willingness has to be a religious enthusiasm, since it celebrates life, since it calls for meaningful sacrifices.\n\u201cThis is bad news for business, as we know it now. It should be thrilling news for persons who love to teach and lead. And thank God we have solid information in the place of superstition! Thank God we are beginning to dream of human communities which are designed to harmonize with what human beings really need and are.", 0.1099412377745711], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["teach", 0.34886440101022925], ["bike", 0.15988054491504206], ["shop", 0.1470946750282962], ["honor", 0.14185987344356807], ["word", 0.10865034447333602], ["borrowed", 0.10435387887236791], ["hiring", 0.10435387887236791], ["boy", 0.09645315133103556], ["job", 0.09471000852422307], ["pickup", 0.08895060819325801], ["appointment", 0.08895060819325801], ["theory", 0.0839918626084978], ["beat", 0.0839918626084978], ["bicycle", 0.07994027245752103], ["interview", 0.07651470179469305], ["offered", 0.0735473375141481], ["teachers", 0.0735473375141481], ["truck", 0.06647058793373622], ["late", 0.05957825619365091], ["bad", 0.05814406683503821], ["caf", 0.05432517223666801], ["kind", 0.052101095379846175], ["cat", 0.052101095379846175], ["asked", 0.05006186012334158], ["talking", 0.04913373109930123], ["left", 0.04735500426211153], ["find", 0.04492835332955615], ["person", 0.04205698151888935], ["lake", 0.031951733583001636], ["good", 0.031951733583001636], ["black", 0.027337525476818423], ["going", 0.024720124684454347], ["prison", 0.02103156607391521]], "sentiment": ["We went outside with him to find out what bicycle he could possibly be talking about.

This was because her garments were heavily impregnated with fluorescent chemicals. So was the bartender\u2019s jacket. So were the African masks on the walls. The chemicals would shine like electric signs when ultraviolet lights in the ceiling were energized. The lights weren\u2019t on just now. The bartender turned them on at random times, at his own whim, in order to give the customers a delightful and mystifying surprise.\nThe power for the lights and for everything electrical in Midland City, incidentally, was generated by coal from strip mines in West Virginia, through which Kilgore Trout had passed not many hours before.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cLeroy Joyce was so dumb,\u201d Bonnie went on, \u201che couldn\u2019t play cards. He couldn\u2019t understand the Bible. He could hardly talk. He ate his last supper, and then he sat still. He was going to be electrocuted for rape. So my husband sat out in the corridor outside the cell, and he read to himself. He heard Leroy moving around in his cell, but he didn\u2019t worry about it. And then Leroy rattled his tin cup on the bars. My husband thought Leroy wanted some more coffee. So he got up and went over and took the cup. Leroy was smiling as though everything was all right now. He wouldn\u2019t have to go to the electric chair after all. He\u2019d cut off his whatchamacallit and put it in the cup.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis book is made up, of course, but the story I had Bonnie tell actually happened in real life\u2014in the death house of a penitentiary in Arkansas.\nAs for Dwayne Hoover\u2019s dog Sparky, who couldn\u2019t wag his tail: Sparky is modeled after a dog my brother owns who has to fight all the time, because he can\u2019t wag his tail.
