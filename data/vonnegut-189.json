It was April again.\nIt was raining outside. Nature sympathized.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI was seated at the place of honor\u2014to the right of my hostess, of Sarah Clewes, the nurse. Of the four women I ever loved, she was always the easiest one to talk to. That may be because I had never promised her anything, and so had never let her down. Oh, Lord\u2014the things I used to promise my mother and my poor wife and poor Mary Kathleen!\nYoung Israel Edel and his not-so-lovely wife, Norma, were there. I say that she was not-so-lovely for the simple reason that she has always hated me. I don\u2019t know why. I have never insulted her, and she is certainly as pleased as Punch with the upturn her husband\u2019s career has taken. He would still be a night clerk, if it weren\u2019t for me. The Edels are renovating a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights with all the money he makes. Still\u2014every time she looks at me, I feel like something the cat dragged in. It is just one of those things. I think she may be slightly crazy. She miscarried twins about a year ago. That might have something to do with it. She may have some sort of chemical imbalance as a result of that. Who knows?\nShe wasn\u2019t seated next to me anyway, thank God. Another black woman was. That was Eucharist Lawes, the lovely wife of Cleveland Lawes, the former RAMJAC chauffeur. He is a vice-president of the Transico Division now. That is really his wife\u2019s name: Eucharist. It means happy gratitude, and I don\u2019t know why more people don\u2019t name their daughters that. Everybody calls her \u201cUkey.\u201d\nUkey was homesick for the South. She said the people were friendlier and more relaxed and more natural down there. She was after Cleveland to retire in or near Atlanta, especially now that the Transico Division had been bought by Playgrounds International, which everybody knows is a front for the Mafia.

I asked Harley III how exactly Harley II had died. He told me his father drowned while trying to rescue a Swedish woman who committed suicide by opening the windows of her Volvo and driving it off a dock and into the Ruhr River at Essen, home, as it happens, of that premier manufacturer of crematoria, A.
