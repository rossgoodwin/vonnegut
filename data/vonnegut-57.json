captive of our nonpareil correctional facilities, first as a juvenile offender and then as an adult offender, for many years. He is about to be released into a world where he has no friends or relatives. Free will is about to kick in again, after a hiatus of a good deal more than a decade. What should he do?\nI, Honorary President of the American Humanist Association, wrote back today, \u201cJoin a church.\u201d I said this because what such a grown-up waif needs more than anything is something like a family.\nI couldn\u2019t recommend Humanism for such a person. I wouldn\u2019t do so for the great majority of the planet\u2019s population.\nThe German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, who had syphilis, said that only a person of deep faith could afford the luxury of religious skepticism. Humanists, by and large educated, comfortably middle-class persons with rewarding lives like mine, find rapture enough in secular knowledge and hope. Most people can\u2019t.\nVoltaire, French author of Candide, and therefore the Humanists\u2019 Abraham, concealed his contempt for the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church from his less educated, simpler-minded, and more frightened employees, because he knew what a stabilizer their religion was for them.\nWith some trepidation, I told Trout in the summer of 2001 about my advice to the man soon to be expelled from prison. He asked if I had heard from this person again, if I knew what had become of him in the intervening five years, or in the intervening ten years, if we wanted to count the rerun.

to damn and doom himself Throwing up his hands and departing, he left us in the hands of a mild old lieutenant and a stenographer. Father told me to describe exactly how I had fired the rifle, and I answered simply and truthfully. The stenographer wrote it down.\nAnd then Father had this to say, for his own part, which was also duly recorded: \u201cThis is only a boy here. His mother and I are morally and legally responsible for his actions, except when it comes to the handling of firearms. I alone am responsible for whatever he does with guns, and I alone am responsible for the terrible accident which happened this afternoon. He has been a good boy up to now, and will be a sturdy and decent man in due time. I have no words of reproach to utter to him now. I gave him a gun and ammunition when he was much too young to have them without any supervision.\u201d He had by then found out I was only twelve, and not sixteen or so. \u201cLeave him out of this. Leave my poor wife out of this. I, Otto Waltz, being of sound mind, do now declare under oath and in fear for my soul, that I alone am to blame.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd I think he was surprised, again, when we weren\u2019t allowed to go home after that. What more could anybody want after a confession that orotund?\nBut he was led off to cells in the basement of police headquarters, and I was taken to a much smaller cell-block on the top floor, the third floor, which was reserved for women and for children under the age of sixteen. There was only one other prisoner up there, a black woman from out of town, who had been taken off a Greyhound bus after beating up the white driver. She was from the Deep South, and she was the one who introduced me to the idea of birth\u2019s being an opening peephole, and of death\u2019s being when that peephole closes again.\nThe idea must have been ordinary, back wherever it was she came from. She said she was sorry she had beat up the bus driver, who had spoken to her insultingly because of her race. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask my peephole to open. It just open one day, and I hear the people saying, \u2018That\u2019s a black one there. Unlucky to be black.\u2019 And that poor driver they took off to the hospital, his peephole done open, and he hear the people saying, \u2018That\u2019s a white one there. Lucky to be white.\u2019 \u201d\nA while later she sad, \u201cMy peephole open, I see this woman, I say, \u2018Who you?\u2019 She say, \u2018I\u2019s you mama.\u2019 I say, \u2018How we doing, Mama?\u2019 She say, \u2018Ain\u2019t doing good. Ain\u2019t got no money, ain\u2019t got no work, ain\u2019t got no house, your daddy on the chain gang, and I already got seven other children whose peepholes opened up on them.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Mama, if you know how to close up my peephole again, you just go ahead and do it.\u2019 And she say, \u2018Don\u2019t you tempt me like that, child.

The really old bits he\u2019d used this night were in his introductory remarks, old stuff as well to most of the people there, but welcome old stuff: \u201cI am as celibate as any heterosexual Roman Catholic priest. I have for your inspection a notarized statement from my urologist to the effect that I am in all respects a healthy male. I am a flaming voluntary neuter. One day I hope to march in a parade on a Neuter Pride Day. If you don\u2019t like that about me, why don\u2019t you take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut? Take a flying fuck at the moooooon.\u201d\nSupermarket tabloids adored him. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe it was possible,\u201d he said, \u201cbut damned if I didn\u2019t invent a new kind of scandal, no monkey business at all.\u201d When casinos and nightclubs would still take their chances with him, despite periodically disruptive problems with drugs, an easy way for them to get publicity was to send out photographs of a bevy of smiling, succulent, nearly naked showgirls with Berman in the middle, lean and quite nice looking, wearing his customary onstage costume: three-piece suit, shirt and tie, buzz-cut red hair, and white basketball shoes. And with Berman seeming about to drop dead of ennui.\nAnd back when he was still welcome on late-night talk shows, not only because he was a freak but because he was an excellent comedian, Gil Berman had the same answer for any host who asked about his being a flaming neuter: \u201cWant to stop smoking cigarettes? Don\u2019t light \u2019em. Want to stop having trouble with women? Don\u2019t kiss \u2019em.\u201d\nHe had made only one comedy CD so far, eight years ago now. It was still selling fairly well in college bookstores, but nowhere else. It was called Who\u2019s Sorry Now? It was time he made another, for which he had this working title, displayed on the theater\u2019s marquee in the cold and rain outside: IF GOD WERE ALIVE TODAY. That was half of the last sentence in Who\u2019s Sorry Now? The whole sentence? \u201cIf God were alive today He\u2019d be an atheist.\u201d\n\u201cI was actually offered full scholarships to Cal Tech and M.I.T.,\u201d he went on now. \u201cCan you believe that? I was so good at science at Knightsbridge High School outside Boston, everybody wanted me to be a chemist or biologist or a physicist or a mathematician or engineer. If I\u2019d become any one of those things, I guarantee you, because I was so smart in high school, the world, or at least this country, would be even more fucked up than it is today. I went to Columbia instead, in pre-law, so my scientific brilliance could be neutered by depressed and obviously insincere teachers of the liberal arts. It worked! The last thing we need is another Bill Gates or Albert Einstein.\u201d\nIt was true about the proffered scholarships in science. His grades in all subjects at Knightsbridge High, arguably the richest public secondary school in the country, were so high that he might have gone on scholarship wherever he chose, and studied whatever he chose. But he could not and should not have accepted a scholarship to anywhere, since his parents were, as he himself said, making a joke of it, \u201cfabulously well-to-do.\u201d He paid full tuition during his five semesters at Columbia. \u201cI could have become anything instead of what you see and hear tonight,\u201d he said onstage of all his opportunities. \u201cMaybe a veterinarian. Can\u2019t you just imagine what a great veterinarian I might have been? Anybody here got a sick aardvark or skink?\u201d\nKnightsbridge High, whose class ring Berman would still be wearing on his dying day, was a rare example of the synergy that is possible when the tax base of a fabulously well-to-do suburb has sky-high hopes for its children. That most enviable of communities spent as much per capita on its students as most private schools spend, the exceptions being luxurious oubliettes on the order of the Nellie Prior Academy.\nThe comedian the audience saw and heard that night, outwardly at least, and possibly inwardly as well, wasn\u2019t all that different from the one they would have seen and heard nine months earlier, right before he went bananas when he was a headliner at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey. At the show that night, he had congratulated Donald Trump in absentia on his comment about the scandal of President William Jefferson Clinton\u2019s having had sex in the Oval Office in the White House with women not his wife, all blowjobs. \u201cNothing but blowjobs, if you want to call that sex,\u201d said Berman. Trump said he couldn\u2019t get over how bad-looking the women were. But then Berman went out onto the floor of the casino itself, and, in his own words there in Northampton, talked about \u201cwatching all the people with the gambling sickness putting their savings into Trump\u2019s pockets, with the help of slot machines, cards, dice, and roulette wheels.\u201d The next thing he knew, Gil Berman had dived onto a craps table. He flopped over on his back and cackled like a chicken, \u201cGuh-guh-guck-guck,\u201d and so on, and kicked chips and drinks everywhere.\nAnother quote was about his going ape-shit in Atlantic City: \u201cEnough of America wasn\u2019t enough for me anymore. Enough had finally become too much even for me, and I committed myself to Caldwell, the famous laughing academy in Salem, Wisconsin\u2014one hell of a town, may I say, where they made me trade old pills for new ones, which I have thrown away.\u201d He was so drug-free now that he wasn\u2019t even taking the antidepressants Hazelden had prescribed for him. His description of the antidepressants? \u201cAbsolutely harmless unless discontinued.\u201d This line, incidentally, was swiped, as Berman would have gladly confessed, if challenged, from a fable about a bear with a drinking problem by the old-time, ink-on-paper American humorist James Thurber, long dead.\nBerman was dressed onstage exactly as he had been when he, as he put it, \u201ctried out for the Olympics on a craps table at the Taj Mahal.\u201d The suit and basketball shoes were already his trademarks in 1978, twenty-two years earlier, when he had dropped out of Columbia University to become a professional comedian. He had first dressed that way, and sported a buzz cut, as an amateur on open-mike nights at \u201cCutty Sark,\u201d an allegedly mob-owned comedy club only eight blocks down Broadway from his dorm at Columbia. He explained to his roommate at the time, Barry Dresdener, that he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to look like a baggy-pants comedian or a Bob Hope, or a Beatnik or a Hippie or a Yuppie. I want to be a clown for our generation, a clown such as has never been seen before.\u201d", 0.08511922274058198], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["body",

His name was Edgar Derby. He hadn\u2019t been in Billy\u2019s boxcar. He\u2019d been in Roland Weary\u2019s car, had cradled Weary\u2019s head while he died. So it goes. Derby was forty-four years old. He was so old he had a son who was a marine in the Pacific theater of war.\nDerby had pulled political wires to get into the army at his age. The subject he had taught in Indianapolis was Contemporary Problems in Western Civilization. He also coached the tennis team, and took very good care of his body.\nDerby\u2019s son would survive the war. Derby wouldn\u2019t. That good body of his would be filled with holes by a firing squad in Dresden in sixty-eight days. So it goes.\nThe worst American body wasn\u2019t Billy\u2019s. The worst body belonged to a car thief from Cicero, Illinois. His name was Paul Lazzaro. He was tiny, and not only were his bones and teeth rotten, but his skin was disgusting. Lazzaro was polka-dotted all over with dime-sized scars. He had had many plagues of boils.\nLazzaro, too, had been on Roland Weary\u2019s boxcar, and had given his word of honor to Weary that he would find some way to make Billy Pilgrim pay for Weary\u2019s death. He was looking around now, wondering which naked human being was Billy.\nThe naked Americans took their places under many showerheads along a white-tiled wall. There were no faucets they could control. They could only wait for whatever was coming. Their penises were shriveled and their balls were retracted. Reproduction was not the main business of the evening.\nAn unseen hand turned a master valve. Out of the showerheads gushed scalding rain. The rain was a blowtorch that did not warm. It jazzed and jangled Billy\u2019s skin without thawing the ice in the marrow of his long bones.\nThe Americans\u2019 clothes were meanwhile passing through poison gas. Body lice and bacteria and fleas were dying by the billions. So it goes.\nAnd Billy zoomed back in time to his infancy. He was a baby who had just been bathed by his mother. Now his mother wrapped him in a towel, carried him into a rosy room that was filled with sunshine. She unwrapped him, laid him on the tickling towel, powdered him between his legs, joked with him, patted his little jelly belly. Her palm on his little jelly belly made potching sounds.\nBilly gurgled and cooed.", 0.04098958333333334], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["calendar", 0.10096528501288292], ["drawer", 0.08851353925432105], ["bed", 0.0848133969829297], ["noel", 0.07318446726360751], ["bedford", 0.06731019000858862], ["dates", 0.06731019000858862], ["yankee", 0.06731019000858862], ["speculator", 0.05900902616954737], ["check", 0.05900902616954737], ["opus", 0.05632624339992484], ["magnum", 0.05632624339992484], ["gideon", 0.05415315661136576], ["wilburhampton", 0.04099612321414288], ["room", 0.039865930851287326], ["built", 0.039734320631414424], ["223", 0.03859288135232071], ["bible", 0.03755082893328323], ["idea", 0.03487845107323281], ["ambassador", 0.03365509500429431], ["woolen", 0.03365509500429431], ["louise", 0.03365509500429431], ["lining", 0.03365509500429431], ["republic", 0.03365509500429431], ["bottomed", 0.03365509500429431], ["1799", 0.03365509500429431], ["loom", 0.03365509500429431], ["illegitimacy", 0.03365509500429431], ["necker", 0.03365509500429431], ["bedsprings", 0.03365509500429431], ["fixer", 0.03365509500429431], ["nourishing", 0.03365509500429431], ["traveling", 0.03365509500429431], ["salesman", 0.03365509500429431], ["describing", 0.03365509500429431], ["pen", 0.03365509500429431], ["envelopes", 0.03365509500429431], ["anne", 0.03365509500429431], ["sylvanus", 0.03365509500429431], ["newspapers", 0.03365509500429431], ["riddle", 0.03365509500429431], ["nattaweena", 0.03365509500429431], ["tribune", 0.03365509500429431], ["springs", 0.03365509500429431], ["stael", 0.03365509500429431], ["france", 0.03365509500429431], ["cookware", 0.03365509500429431], ["napoleon", 0.03365509500429431], ["humbler", 0.03365509500429431], ["newspaper", 0.03365509500429431], ["eats", 0.03365509500429431], ["swedish", 0.03365509500429431], ["germaine", 0.03365509500429431], ["dresser", 0.03365509500429431], ["baronne", 0.03365509500429431], ["unattractive", 0.03365509500429431], ["quotations", 0.03365509500429431], ["1801", 0.03365509500429431], ["headquarters", 0.03365509500429431], ["holstein", 0.03365509500429431], ["wife", 0.032694959375101626], ["valuable", 0.029504513084773684], ["de", 0.029504513084773684], ["sized", 0.029504513084773684], ["benjamin", 0.029504513084773684], ["angeles", 0.029504513084773684], ["anarchist", 0.029504513084773684], ["survive", 0.029504513084773684], ["los", 0.029504513084773684], ["genesis", 0.029504513084773684], ["lover", 0.029504513084773684], ["balance", 0.029504513084773684], ["drawers", 0.029504513084773684], ["mills", 0.029504513084773684], ["materials", 0.029504513084773684], ["father", 0.027403549168167018], ["bank", 0.02707657830568288], ["fortune", 0.02707657830568288], ["physically", 0.02707657830568288], ["drinks", 0.02707657830568288], ["narrow", 0.02707657830568288], ["copper", 0.02707657830568288], ["morally", 0.02707657830568288], ["trace", 0.02707657830568288], ["massachusetts", 0.02707657830568288], ["constant", 0.026736917574994298], ["division", 0.025353931165253054], ["locked", 0.025353931165253054], ["lined", 0.025353931165253054], ["corporate", 0.025353931165253054], ["rate", 0.024017742235227846], ["owned", 0.024017742235227846], ["failure", 0.024017742235227846], ["structure", 0.024017742235227846], ["feet", 0.02374628390408101], ["desk", 0.02292599638616225], ["hotel", 0.02292599638616225], ["fourteen", 0.02200293842312477], ["telephone", 0.02200293842312477], ["native", 0.02200293842312477], ["government", 0.021203349245732424], ["market", 0.02049806160707144], ["eleven", 0.02049806160707144], ["grand", 0.02049806160707144], ["answer", 0.02049806160707144], ["trouble", 0.019296440676160355], ["stock", 0.019296440676160355], ["wide", 0.019296440676160355], ["book", 0.019296440676160355], ["twelve", 0.018775414466641615], ["bottom", 0.01829611681590188], ["middle", 0.01785235650360414], ["single", 0.01785235650360414], ["head", 0.017691810051803803], ["family", 0.017439225536616407], ["sat", 0.01705276732621179], ["question", 0.016689745638688226], ["close", 0.016347479687550813], ["business", 0.016347479687550813], ["turn", 0.016347479687550813], ["water", 0.01571657839618658], ["thirty", 0.01571657839618658], ["dollars", 0.015424421724513337], ["began", 0.015424421724513337], ["company", 0.014380389466161372], ["night", 0.014145534896381247], ["man", 0.0124003998448692], ["years", 0.010111228940076792], ["long", 0.0094452071729497], ["malachi", 0.007644284094990816], ["three", 0.0074907366062881954], ["time", 0.0065785166986114365]], "sentiment": ["Magnum Opus began as an idea in the head of a Yankee traveling salesman of copper-bottomed cookware. That Yankee was Noel Constant, a native of New Bedford, Massachusetts. He was the father of Malachi.\nThe father of Noel, in turn, was Sylvanus Constant, a loom fixer in the New Bedford Mills of the Nattaweena Division of the Grand Republic Woolen Company. He was an anarchist, though he never got into any trouble about it, except with his wife.\nThe family could trace its line back through an illegitimacy to Benjamin Constant, who was a tribune under Napoleon from 1799 to 1801, and a lover of Anne Louise Germaine Necker, Baronne de Stael-Holstein, wife of the then Swedish ambassador to France.\nOne night in Los Angeles, at any rate, Noel Constant got it into his head to become a speculator. He was thirty-nine at the time, single, physically and morally unattractive, and a business failure. The idea of becoming a speculator came to him as he sat all alone on a narrow bed in Room 223 of the Wilburhampton Hotel.\nThe most valuable corporate structure ever to be owned by one man could not have had humbler headquarters in the beginning. Room 223 of the Wilburhampton was eleven feet long and eight feet wide, and had neither telephone nor desk.\nWhat it did have was a bed, a three-drawer dresser, old newspapers lining the drawers, and, in the bottom drawer, a Gideon Bible. The newspaper page that lined the middle drawer was a page of stock-market quotations from fourteen years before.\nThere is a riddle about a man who is locked in a room with nothing but a bed and a calendar, and the question is: How does he survive?\nThe answer is: He eats dates from the calendar and drinks water from the springs of the bed.\nThis comes very close to describing the genesis of Magnum Opus.

["So his answer to Bobby King\u2019s question was that he was setting a good example he hoped others would follow by taking \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d\nIt is a joke to me that this man should have presented himself as an ardent conservationist, since so many of the companies he served as a director or in which he was a major stockholder were notorious damagers of the water or the soil or the atmosphere. But it wasn\u2019t a joke to *MacIntosh, who had come into this world incapable of caring much about anything. So, in order to hide this deficiency, he had become a great actor, pretending even to himself that he cared passionately about all sorts of things.\nWith the same degree of conviction, he had earlier given his daughter an entirely different explanation of why they were going to the islands on the Bah\u00eda de Darwin instead of the Omoo. The Hiroguchis might feel trapped on the Omoo, with nobody but the MacIntoshes to talk to. They might panic under such circumstances, and *Zenji might refuse to negotiate anymore, and ask to be put ashore at the nearest port so that he and his wife could fly back home.\nLike so many other pathological personalities in positions of power a million years ago, he might do almost anything on impulse, feeling nothing much. The logical explanations for his actions, invented at leisure, always came afterwards.\nAnd let that sort of behavior back in the era of the big brains be taken as a capsule history of the war I had the honor to fight in, which was the Vietnam War.\n19\nLIKE MOST PATHOLOGICAL PERSONALITIES, *Andrew MacIntosh never cared much whether what he said was true or not\u2014and so he was tremendously persuasive. And he so moved the widow Onassis and Rudolf Nureyev that they asked Bobby King for more information about \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century,\u201d which he sent to them on the following morning by special messenger.\nAs luck would have it, there was going to be a documentary about the lives of blue-footed boobies on the islands shown on educational television that evening, so King enclosed notes saying that they might want to watch it. These birds would later become crucial to the survival of the little human colony on Santa Rosalia. If those birds hadn\u2019t been so stupid, so incapable of learning that human beings were dangerous, the first settlers would almost certainly have starved to death.\nThe high point of that program, like the high point of Mary Hepburn\u2019s lectures on the islands at Ilium High School, was film footage of the courtship dance of the blue-footed boobies. The dance went like this:\nThere were these two fairly large sea birds standing around on the lava. They were about the size of flightless cormorants, and had the same long, snaky necks and fish-spear beaks. But they had not given up on aviation, and so had big, strong wings. Their legs and webbed feet were bright, rubbery blue. They caught fish by crashing down on them from the sky.", 0.13805886243386245], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["gorgon", 0.08127800478548425], ["chauffeur", 0.0740635653109713],

["So it was an easy walk, and I soon found myself standing in front of a noble oak door which my new master had used on the cover of the Christmas issue of Liberty magazine. The massive iron hinges were rusty. Nobody could counterfeit rust and rust-stained oak like Dan Gregory. The knocker was in the shape of a Gorgon\u2019s head, with intertwined asps forming her necklace and hair.\nIf you looked directly at a Gorgon, supposedly, you were turned to stone. I told that today to the kids around my swimming pool. They had never heard of a Gorgon. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve heard of anything that wasn\u2019t on TV less than a week ago.\nOn the Liberty cover, as in real life, the lines in the Gorgon\u2019s malevolent face and the creases between the writhing asps were infected with verdigris. Nobody could counterfeit verdigris like Dan Gregory. There was a holly wreath around the knocker on the cover, which had been taken down by the time I got there. Some of the leaves had been brown around the edges or spotted. Nobody could counterfeit plant diseases like Dan Gregory.\nSo I lifted the Gorgon\u2019s heavy necklace and let it fall. The boom reverberated in an entrance hall whose chandelier and spiral staircase would also be old stuff to me. I had seen them in an illustration of a story about a fabulously rich girl who fell in love with her family\u2019s chauffeur: in Collier\u2019s, I believe.\nThe face of the man who answered my boom was also well known to me, if not his name, since he had been a model for many of Gregory\u2019s pictures\u2014including one about a rich girl and her chauffeur. He had been the chauffeur, who in the story would save the girl\u2019s father\u2019s business after everybody but the girl scorned him as being nothing but a chauffeur. That story, incidentally, was made into the movie You\u2019re Fired, the second movie to star sound as well as images. The first one was The Jazz Singer, starring Al Jolson, who was a friend of Dan Gregory until they had a falling out about Mussolini during my first night there.\nThe man who opened the door to me had a very good face for an American-style hero, and had in fact been an aviator during the First World War. He was truly Gregory\u2019s assistant, what Marilee Kemp had only claimed to be, and would become the only friend who stuck with Gregory to the bitter end. He, too, would be shot while wearing an Italian uniform in Egypt during not his First but his Second World War.\nSo says this one-eyed Armenian fortune-teller as he peers into his crystal ball.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d he said. There wasn\u2019t a flicker of recognition in his eyes, although he knew who I was and that I would be coming to the house at any time. He and Gregory had resolved to give me a chilly welcome. I can only guess at their deliberations prior to my arrival, but they must have been along the lines of my being a parasite which Marilee had brought into the house, a thief who had already stolen hundreds of dollars\u2019 worth of art materials.\nThey must have persuaded themselves, too, that Marilee was wholly to blame for her backward somersaults down the studio staircase, and that she had unjustly blamed Gregory. As I say, I myself would believe that until she told me the truth of the matter after the war.\nSo, just to start somewhere in proving that I was right to be on the doorstep, I asked for Marilee.",

They hadn\u2019t taught me how to do it, since there had been such bitterness in America against all things German during the First World War. I tried a few words I knew on our captors, and they asked me if I was of German ancestry, and I said, \u201cYes.\u201d They wanted to know why I was making war against my brothers.\nINTERVIEWER: And you said\u2014?\nVONNEGUT: I honestly found the question ignorant and comical. My parents had separated me so thoroughly from my Germanic past that my captors might as well have been Bolivians or Tibetans, for all they meant to me.\nINTERVIEWER: After you were captured, you were shipped to Dresden?\nVONNEGUT: In the same boxcars that had brought up the troops that captured us\u2014probably in the same boxcars that had delivered Jews and Gypsies and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and so on to the extermination camps. Rolling stock is rolling stock. British mosquito bombers attacked us at night a few times. I guess they thought we were strategic materials of some kind. They hit a car containing most of the officers from our battalion. Every time I say I hate officers, which I still do fairly frequently, I have to remind myself that practically none of the officers I served under survived. Christmas was in there somewhere.\nINTERVIEWER: And you finally arrived in Dresden.\nVONNEGUT: In a huge prison camp south of Dresden first. The privates were separated from the noncoms and officers. Under the articles of the Geneva Convention, which is a very Edwardian document, privates were required to work for their keep. Everybody else got to languish in prison. As a private, I was shipped to Dresden.\nINTERVIEWER: What were your impressions of the city itself before the bombing?\nVONNEGUT: The first fancy city I\u2019d ever seen. A city full of statues and zoos, like Paris. We were living in a slaughterhouse, in a nice new cement-block hog barn. They put bunks and straw mattresses in the barn, and we went to work every morning as contract labor in a malt syrup factory. The syrup was for pregnant women. The damned sirens would go off and we\u2019d hear some other city getting it\u2014whump a whump a whumpa whump. We never expected to get it. There were very few air raid shelters in town and no war industries, just cigarette factories, hospitals, clarinet factories. Then a siren went off\u2014it was February 13, 1945\u2014and we went down two stories under the pavement into a big meat locker. It was cool there, with cadavers hanging all around. When we came up the city was gone.\nINTERVIEWER: You didn\u2019t suffocate in the meat locker?", 0.10872316919191921], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["earl", 0.15497573130881376], ["hotbox", 0.15314336557171543], ["harry", 0.12398058504705102], ["kid", 0.10874578937403657], ["women", 0.10114922724800324], ["mother", 0.09809628011718903], ["worth", 0.08759571019422496], ["visiting", 0.06752846667095777], ["sorority", 0.06752846667095777], ["loyally", 0.06752846667095777], ["treats", 0.06752846667095777], ["times", 0.06324134848419746], ["sweet", 0.06324134848419746], ["psychology", 0.05907545227388526], ["drives", 0.05907545227388526], ["exhaled", 0.05907545227388526], ["responsibility", 0.05907545227388526], ["smashed", 0.05907545227388526], ["talking", 0.05858146466071676], ["clicked", 0.05413075583354179], ["rude", 0.05413075583354179], ["spitfire", 0.05413075583354179], ["relief", 0.05413075583354179], ["ten", 0.051301147866668055], ["stairway", 0.050622437876812754], ["nuts", 0.050622437876812754], ["law", 0.050622437876812754], ["view", 0.050622437876812754], ["yeah", 0.04790117505590776], ["spend", 0.04567774143646929], ["stairs", 0.04567774143646929], ["honest", 0.04379785509711248], ["worse", 0.04216942347974026], ["returned", 0.04073304499612582], ["seconds", 0.03944816065883525], ["shut", 0.03828584139292886], ["point", 0.037224727039396784], ["honey", 0.037224727039396784], ["question", 0.037224727039396784], ["top", 0.034503464218491785], ["course", 0.03371640908266775], ["lady", 0.03297708442636976], ["ella", 0.03297708442636976], ["understand", 0.03228003059905332], ["care", 0.03228003059905332], ["living", 0.030400144259696508], ["year", 0.02877171264232428], ["hear", 0.02779558206093969], ["guess", 0.026891826302967475], ["work", 0.026891826302967475], ["men", 0.026050449821419283], ["god", 0.024888130555512884], ["called", 0.024524070029297258], ["things", 0.024170563482062476], ["house", 0.023492882370418442], ["man", 0.022735709293425495], ["turned", 0.021947129862624003], ["head", 0.021105753381075818], ["door", 0.01982086904378525]], "sentiment": ["The door at the top of the stairs clicked shut, and Earl exhaled with relief. \u201cHonest to God, Harry,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s like living in a sorority house around here lately.

He decides that it is a little old man sitting on a cot in a second-story dormitory. Every so often that little old man is so delighted with his thoughts, evidently, that he claps three times.\nSo the judge flies into the ear of that little old man and immediately sticks to him forever, sticks to him, according to the story \u2026 as tightly as Formica to an epoxy-coated countertop.\u201d And what does he hear in that little old man\u2019s head but this:\nSally in the garden,\nSifting cinders,\nLifted up her leg\nAnd farted like a man \u2026\nAnd so on.\nIt is quite an interesting story. There is a rescue of the daughter who has become the soul of a moon rock, and so on. But the true story of how its author came to commit treason in Osaka is a match for it, in my opinion, any day. Bob Fender fell in love with the North Korean agent, the Edith Piaf imitator, from a distance of about twenty feet, in a nightclub frequented by American officers. He never dared close the distance or to send her flowers or a note, but night after night he mooned at her from the same table. He was always alone and usually the biggest man by far in the club, so the singer, whose stage name was simply \u201cIzumi,\u201d asked some of the other Americans who and what Fender was.\nHe was a virgin meat inspector, but his fellow officers had fun telling Izumi that he was so solitary and gloomy all the time because his work was so secret and important. They said he was in command of an elite unit that guarded atomic bombs.

suddenly quit fighting. I guess it had used up every bit of its energy. That was that.\nThis fish, which I picked up by the gills and flung up on the bank, was an enormous pickerel. Margaret looked down at it in horror and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a crocodile!\u201d\nI looked at the top of the bank to see what the convicts and guards thought of a fish that big. They were gone. There was nothing but the broken-down van up there. The little door to its steel box was wide open. Anybody was free to climb inside and close the door, in case he or she wondered what it felt like to be a prisoner.\nTO THOSE FASCINATED by Forensic Medicine: The pickerel had not bitten on the worm on the hook. It had bitten on a perch which had bitten on the worm on the hook.\nI thought that would be interesting to my mother-in-law during our trip back home in the new Mercedes. But she didn\u2019t want to talk about the fish at all. It had scared the daylights out of her, and she wanted to forget it.\nAs the years went by, I would mention the fish from time to time without getting anything back from her but a stony silence. I concluded that she really had purged it from her memory.\nBut then, on the night of the prison break, when the 3 of us were living in an old house in the hamlet of Athena, down below the prison walls, there was this terrific explosion that woke us up.\nIf Jack Patton had been there with us, he might have said to me, \u201cGene! Gene! They\u2019re playing our tune again.\u201d\nThe explosion was in fact the demolition of Athena\u2019s main gate from the outside, not the inside. The purported head of the Jamaican drug cartel, Jeffrey Turner, had been brought down to Athena in a steel box 6 months before, after a televised trial lasting a year and a half. He was given 25 consecutive life sentences, said to be a new record. Now a well-rehearsed force of his employees, variously estimated as being anything from a platoon to a company, had arrived outside the prison with explosives, a tank, and several half-tracks taken from the National Guard Armory about 10 kilometers south of Rochester, across the highway from the Meadowdale Cinema Complex.
