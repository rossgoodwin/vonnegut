City of London wanted to give Shaw its Order of Merit, he thanked them for it, but said he had already given it to himself.\nI would have accepted it. I would have recognized the opportunity for a world-class joke, but would never allow myself to be funny at the cost of making somebody else feel like something the cat drug in.\nLet that be my epitaph.\nIn the waning summer of 1996, I ask myself if there were ideas I once held that I should now repudiate. I consider the example set by my father\u2019s only brother, Uncle Alex, the childless, Harvard-educated Indianapolis insurance salesman. He had me reading high-level socialist writers like Shaw and Norman Thomas and Eugene Debs and John Dos Passos when I was a teenager, along with making model airplanes and jerking off. After World War Two, Uncle Alex became as politically conservative as the Archangel Gabriel.\nBut I still like what O\u2019Hare and I said to German soldiers right after we were liberated: That America was going to become more socialist, was going to try harder to give everybody work to do, and to ensure that our children, at least, weren\u2019t hungry or cold or illiterate or scared to death.\nLotsa luck!\nI still quote Eugene Debs (1855-1926), late of Terre Haute, Indiana, five times the Socialist Party\u2019s candidate for President, in every speech:\n\u201cWhile there is a lower class I am in it, while there is a criminal element I am of it; while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\u201d\nIn recent years, I\u2019ve found it prudent to say before quoting Debs that he is to be taken seriously. Otherwise many in the audience will start to laugh. They are being nice, not mean, knowing I like to be funny.

still running so long ago, a big, homely girl, as I recall, and big and homely still, according to Ketchum, was living with a refugee Czech playwright on Molokai, in the Hawaiian Islands, where she owned a ranch and was raising Arabian horses.\n\u201cShe sent me a play by her lover,\u201d said Ketchum. \u201cShe thought maybe I could find a producer for it, since, of course, there in Midland City, Ohio, I was falling over producers every time I turned around.\u201d\nAnd my brother Felix parodied the line about there being a broken heart for every light on Broadway in New York City. He substituted the name of Midland City\u2019s main drag. \u201cThere\u2019s a broken heart for every light on old Harrison Avenue,\u201d he said. And he got up, and went for more champagne.\nHis way up the stairs to the hotel proper was blocked by a Haitian painter, who had fallen asleep while waiting for a tourist, any tourist, to come back from a night on the town. He had garish pictures of Adam and Eve and the serpent, and of Haitian village life, with all the people with their hands in their pockets, since the artist couldn\u2019t draw hands very well, and so on, lining the staircase on either side.\nFelix did not disturb him. He stepped over him very respectfully. If Felix had seemed to kick him intentionally, Felix would have been in very serious trouble. This is no ordinary colonial situation down here. Haiti as a nation was born out of the only successful slave revolt in all of human history. Imagine that. In no other instance have slaves overwhelmed their masters, begun to govern themselves and to deal on their own with other nations, and repelled foreigners who felt that natural law required them to be slaves again.\nSo, as we had been warned when we bought the hotel here, any white or lightly colored person who struck or even menaced a Haitian in a manner suggesting a master-and-slave relationship would find himself in prison.\nThis was understandable.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhile Felix was away, I asked Ketchum if the Czech refugee\u2019s play was any good. He said that he was in no position to judge, and that neither was Jane Metzger, since it was written in Czech. \u201cIt is a comedy, I\u2019m told,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be very funny.\u201d\n\u201cFunnier than my play, certainly,\u201d I said. And here is an eerie business: Twenty-three years ago, back in 1959, I entered a playwriting contest sponsored by the Caldwell Foundation, and I won, and my prize was a professional production of my play at the Theatre de Lys in Greenwich Village. It was called Katmandu.

Pilgrim.\nShortly after he went to sleep that night, Billy traveled in time to another moment which was quite nice, his wedding night with the former Valencia Merble. He had been out of the veterans\u2019 hospital for six months. He was all well. He had graduated from the Ilium School of Optometry\u2014third in his class of forty-seven.\nNow he was in bed with Valencia in a delightful studio apartment which was built on the end of a wharf on Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Across the water were the lights of Gloucester. Billy was on top of Valencia, making love to her. One result of this act would be the birth of Robert Pilgrim, who would become a problem in high school, but who would then straighten out as a member of the famous Green Berets.\nValencia wasn\u2019t a time-traveler, but she did have a lively imagination. While Billy was making love to her, she imagined that she was a famous woman in history. She was being Queen Elizabeth the First of England, and Billy was supposedly Christopher Columbus.\nBilly made a noise like a small, rusty hinge. He had just emptied his seminal vesicles into Valencia, had contributed his share of the Green Beret. According to the Tralfamadorians, of course, the Green Beret would have seven parents in all.\nNow he rolled off his huge wife, whose rapt expression did not change when he departed. He lay with the buttons of his spine along the edge of the mattress, folded his hands behind his head. He was rich now. He had been rewarded for marrying a girl nobody in his right mind would have married. His father-in-law had given him a new Buick Roadmaster, an all-electric home, and had made him manager of his most prosperous office, his Ilium office, where Billy could expect to make at least thirty thousand dollars a year. That was good. His father had been only a barber.\nAs his mother said, \u201cThe Pilgrims are coming up in the world.\u201d\nThe honeymoon was taking place in the bittersweet mysteries of Indian Summer in New England. The lovers\u2019 apartment had one romantic wall which was all French doors.

facing starvation like so many other people in Guayaquil, thought his big problem was enemies with little radios. And when he broke in through the back door of what was plainly a defunct souvenir shop, it wasn\u2019t a souvenir shop to him. To him it was the headquarters of the Ecuadorian Ballet Folkl\u00f3rico, and he was now going to get his chance to prove that he really was the greatest dancer in the world.\nThere are still plenty of hallucinators today, people who respond passionately to all sorts of things which aren\u2019t really going on. This could be a legacy from the Kanka-bonos. But people like that can\u2019t get hold of weapons now, and they\u2019re easy to swim away from. Even if they found a grenade or a machine gun or a knife or whatever left over from olden times, how could they ever make use of it with just their flippers and their mouths?\nWhen I was a child in Cohoes, my mother took me to see the circus in Albany one time, although we could not afford it and Father did not approve of circuses. And there were trained seals and sea lions there who could balance balls on their noses and blow horns and clap their flippers on cue and so on.\nBut they could never have loaded and cocked a machine gun, or pulled the pin on a hand grenade and thrown it any distance with any accuracy.\nAs to how a person as crazy as Delgado got into the army in the first place: He looked all right and he acted all right when he talked to the recruiting officer, just as I did when I enlisted in the United States Marines. And Delgado was taken in during the previous summer, about the time Roy Hepburn died, for short-term service specifically associated with \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d His unit was to be a spit-and-polish drill team which was to strut its stuff before Mrs. Onassis and the rest of them. They were going to have assault rifles and steel helmets and all that, but surely not live ammunition.\nAnd Delgado was a wonderful marcher and polisher of brass buttons and shiner of shoes. But then Ecuador was convulsed by this economic crisis, and live ammunition was passed out to the soldiery.\nHe was a harrowing example of quick evolution, but then so was any soldier. When I was through with Marine boot camp, and I was sent to Vietnam and issued live ammunition, I bore almost no resemblance to the feckless animal I had been in civilian life. And I did worse things than Delgado.\nNow, then: The store that Delgado broke into was in a block of locked business establishments facing the El Dorado. The soldiers who had strung barbed wire around the hotel considered the stores as part of their barrier. So that when Delgado broke open the back door of one, and then unlocked its front door just a hair and peeked out, he had made a hole in the barrier, through which somebody else might pass. This breach was his contribution to the future of humankind, since very important people would pass through it in a very short while, and reach the hotel.\nWhen Delgado looked out through the crack in the door, he saw two of his enemies. One of them was flourishing a little radio which could scramble his brains\u2014or so he thought. This wasn\u2019t a radio. It was Mandarax, and the two supposed enemies were *Zenji Hiroguchi and *Andrew MacIntosh. They were walking briskly along the inside of the barricade, as they were entitled to do, since they were guests at the hotel.\n*Hiroguchi was still boiling mad, and *MacIntosh was joshing him about taking life too seriously. They went right past the store where Delgado was lurking. So Delgado stepped out through the front door and shot them both in what he believed to be self-defense.", 0.0752667430608607], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["kitsch", 0.1192222480046245], ["girls", 0.07741866586347904], ["taste", 0.0686130354381557], ["potter", 0.0686130354381557], ["prostitution", 0.0686130354381557], ["tires", 0.0686130354381557], ["victorians", 0.0686130354381557], ["smallpox", 0.0686130354381557], ["gravel", 0.0686130354381557], ["miscarriages", 0.0686130354381557], ["burble", 0.0686130354381557], ["swish", 0.0686130354381557], ["widowhood", 0.0686130354381557], ["16", 0.0686130354381557], ["diphtheria", 0.0686130354381557], ["serious", 0.0621514797621253], ["violent", 0.05961112400231225], ["poverty", 0.05961112400231225], ["pneumonia", 0.05961112400231225], ["sunset", 0.05961112400231225], ["psychiatrist", 0.05961112400231225], ["husbands", 0.05961112400231225], ["decide", 0.05961112400231225], ["boyfriend", 0.05961112400231225], ["snarl", 0.05961112400231225], ["driveway", 0.05434534337753089], ["blow", 0.05434534337753089], ["jeered", 0.05434534337753089], ["sooner", 0.05434534337753089], ["meaning", 0.05434534337753089], ["ferrari", 0.05434534337753089], ["burial", 0.05060921256646881], ["innocent", 0.05060921256646881], ["sick", 0.047711244367582964], ["notice", 0.047711244367582964], ["field", 0.045343431941687454], ["swings", 0.045343431941687454], ["unhappy", 0.045343431941687454], ["respect", 0.04334147506081396], ["girl", 0.041607301130625364], ["wrote", 0.041607301130625364], ["suddenly", 0.04007765131690609], ["thinking", 0.03870933293173952], ["leaving", 0.037471538388826206], ["stand", 0.036341520505844], ["weeks", 0.0353020048217721], ["pictures", 0.035100729766588644], ["understand", 0.03433956362497052], ["bad", 0.03344355230695816], ["art", 0.032671481506567256], ["won", 0.03260538969478192], ["happy", 0.03260538969478192], ["daughter", 0.03260538969478192], ["word", 0.03181805694391913], ["mine", 0.030373568176253876], ["read", 0.027892331335179727], ["death", 0.027892331335179727], ["celeste", 0.027339609070000558], ["door", 0.027339609070000558], ["call", 0.026809453297010236], ["better", 0.026300093385928657], ["book", 0.026300093385928657], ["called", 0.025809959256281295], ["matter", 0.025337652189127074], ["cook", 0.024441640871114716], ["looked", 0.02401579901627068], ["best", 0.023603478258938472], ["died", 0.022073828445219205], ["thought", 0.016569747318253475], ["asked", 0.015013887580427232], ["berman", 0.013624639274554927], ["time", 0.009609207096986812]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI\u2019ve done my best to understand and respect your pictures,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you do the same for mine?\u201d\n\u201cDo you know the meaning of the word \u201ckitsch\u201d?\u201d I said.\n\u201cI wrote a book called Kitsch,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI read it,\u201d said Celeste. \u201cIt\u2019s about a girl whose boyfriend tried to make her think she has bad taste, which she does\u2014but it doesn\u2019t matter much.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t call these pictures of little girls on swings serious art?\u201d jeered Mrs. Berman. \u201cTry thinking what the Victorians thought when they looked at them, which was how sick or unhappy so many of these happy, innocent little girls would be in just a little while\u2014diphtheria, pneumonia, smallpox, miscarriages, violent husbands, poverty, widowhood, prostitution\u2014death and burial in potter\u2019s field.\u201d\nThere was the swish of tires in the gravel driveway. \u201cTime to go,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you can\u2019t stand truly serious art.

at the beginning of this one, that he must subtitle it as being controversial for this reason: \u201c\u2026 for almost everything that is said here, there is an opposite, if intellectually unequal, reaction set down somewhere. This is of course a pity, but on the other hand I have not expected to bring around the world by acclamation.\u201d\nThese are, I submit, the nearly weightless words of an undefeatable debater rather than of a passionate advocate\u2014a debater who, because he is so good at debating, is about to make ninnies of the opposition yet again, knowing that nobody is going to be particularly burned up afterward. He continues to do what he did as a Yale undergraduate, which was to engage in badinage with registered Democrats, and always genially. He tells us that \u201c\u2026 one of the reasons I was so happy at Yale was that geniality is \u2026 as natural to Yale as laughter is to Dublin, song to Milan, or angst to The New York Review of Books.\u201d\nI, for one, am grateful that Buckley, serious or not, has volunteered to be as consistent in his responses to outside stimuli as a pinball machine, a machine designed to teach conservative ideals\u20145,000 points for the electric chair, 10,000 for right-to-work laws, 50,000 for more sympathy with the CIA, a cool million for individual excellence and daring, and so on. If we did not have such an intelligent and genial man (as compared with General Goldwater, for instance) to argue in favor of social Darwinism, some of us might be too appalled and confused to listen, to learn for our own good how uncharitable we had better be.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWilliam F. Buckley, Jr., is a friend of mine. Ours is a New York friendship. A New York friendship is a friendship with a person you have met at least once. If you have met a person only once, and you are a New Yorker, you are entitled to say, whenever that person\u2019s name comes up in conversation, \u201cYes\u2014so-and-so is a friend of mine.\u201d\nI have met Mr. Buckley, or Bill, as his friends call him, maybe thrice, for a grand total of sixty seconds. I am intimidated by his cultural and athletic accomplishments, and by his social rank\u2014but especially by his skills as a debater. I have no idea how to win an argument, or even to hold my own in one.\nIf I am to say what I believe, I must do so without opposition, or I am mute. I have been on the Irv Kupcinet Show, a talk show originating in Chicago, four times. I have never said a word. I ran into Mr. Kupcinet recently, and he said he would certainly like to have me on again. Why not?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI spoke one time at the Library of Congress, in 1972, or so. A man stood up in the middle of the audience, when I was about halfway through, and he said, \u201cWhat right have you, as a leader of America\u2019s young people, to make those people so cynical and pessimistic?\u2019\u201d\nI had no good answer, so I left the stage.", 0.13295712224283654], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["river", 0.09714621521085151], ["amy",

powder, rouge, perfume, nail polish, manicure scissors, nail file, nail buffer, eyebrow pencil, tweezers, bobby pins, vitamin tablets, needle and thread, eyedrops, brush, and comb.\nShe closed the drawer, and looked up to see the baleful eyes of Miss Hostetter, who watched her through a screen of milling girls in the doorway of the recreation room, watched her over a cup of steaming coffee and a saucer with two little cookies on it.\nAmy smiled at her glassily, and went into the recreation room. \u201cPing-pong, anybody?\u201d said Amy, fighting to keep her voice even.\nShe received a dozen merry challenges, and, during the recreation period, she daydreamed to the took-took of the ping-pong ball instead of the tack-tack of her typewriter.\n* * *\nAt five, whistles blew triumphantly in the works and all over Pittsburgh.\nMy wife-to-be had spent the afternoon in a suppressed frenzy of fear, excitement, and love. Her wastebasket was stuffed with mistakes. She hadn\u2019t dared to play Barrow\u2019s record again, or even to exchange a glance with Miss Hostetter, for fear of giving away her terrible secret.\nNow, at five, Andr\u00e9 Kostelanetz and Mantovani and the blowers of the heating system were turned off. The mail girls came into the girl pool with trays of cylinders to be transcribed first thing in the morning. They emptied withered flowers from the vases on the desks.

It's a very complicated question. Jesus--you know? You have to explain what it's like to be in the Air Force and how they give you your orders and all that. What it feels like to be in a plane, what the world looks like down there. After I got home from the war, the minister of my church asked me if I would speak to a scout troop that met in the church basement. So I did. They met on Thursday nights. I used to belong to that troop. I never made Eagle Scout. But you know something? It's a very strange kind of kid that makes Eagle Scout. They always seem so lonesome, like they'd worked real hard to get a job nobody else cares about. They get a whole bunch of merit badges. That's how you get to be an Eagle Scout. I don't think I had over five or six merit badges. The only one I remember is Public Health. That was a bitch. The Boy Scout Manual said I was supposed to find out what my town did about sewage. Jesus, they just dumped it all in Sugar Creek.\n(laughs idiotically) Sugar Creek! That was a long time ago, but it's all coming back to me now. There was another merit badge you could get for roller skating. There used to be a roller rink at a bend in Sugar Creek, up above where the sewage went in. I got in a fight there one time. I had on roller skates, and the guy I was fighting had on basketball shoes. He had a tremendous advantage over me. He was a little guy, but he beat the shit out of me. I had to laugh like hell. Don't ever fight a guy when you've got on roller skates.\n(silence)\nJesus--I remember my mother used to make me chew bananas for a full minute before I swallowed--so I wouldn't get sick. Makes you wonder what else your parents told you that wasn't true.\nBlackout.\nSCENE FIVE\nSPOTLIGHT comes up on HAROLD. He sits on the front seat of an imaginary car. The seat is covered with zebra skin.\nHAROLD\nThe night I met Penelope, I had no beard--so imagine me, if you can, without a beard. Actually, I wasn't as good-looking then as I am now.
