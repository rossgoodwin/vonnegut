When I became accustomed to the horror of it, Mr. Ashland, I said, \"So be it. May Major Stepan Ivankov and Captain Bryant Ashland serve to reproach us, whenever we look at the sky, for making a world in which there is no trust. May the two men be the beginning of trust between peoples. May they mark the end of the time when science sent our good, brave young men hurtling to meet in death.\"\nI enclose a photograph of my family, taken during Stepan\u2019s last visit to us. It is an excellent picture of Stepan. The body of water in the background is the Black Sea.\nMikhail Ivankov\nDear Mr. Ivankov:\nThank you for the letter about our sons. I never did get it in the mail. It was in all the papers after your Mr. Koshevoi read it out loud in the United Nations. I never did get a copy just for me. I guess Mr. Koshevoi forgot to drop it in the mailbox. That\u2019s all right. I guess that\u2019s the modern way to deliver important letters, just hand them to reporters. They say your letter to me is just about the most important thing that\u2019s happened lately, outside of the fact we didn\u2019t go to war over what happened between our two boys.\nI don\u2019t speak Russian, and I don\u2019t have anybody right close by who does, so you\u2019ll have to excuse the English. Alexei can read it to you. You tell him he writes English very well\u2014better than I do.\nOh, I could have had a lot of expert help with this letter, if I\u2019d wanted it\u2014people happy to write to you in perfect Russian or perfect English or perfect anything at all. Seems like everybody in this country is like your boy Alexei. They all know better than I do what I should say to you. They say I have a chance to make history, if I answer you back the right things. One big magazine in New York offered me two thousand dollars for my letter back to you, and then it turned out I wasn\u2019t even supposed to write a letter for all that money. The magazine people had already written it, and all I had to do was sign it. Don\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t.\nI tell you, Mr. Ivankov, I have had a bellyful of experts. If you ask me, our boys were experted to death. Your experts would do something, then our experts would answer back with some fancy billion-dollar stunt, and then your experts would answer that back with something fancier, and what happened finally happened. It was just like a bunch of kids with billions of dollars or billions of rubles or whatever.\nYou are lucky you have a son left, Mr. Ivankov. Hazel and I don\u2019t. Bryant was the only son Hazel and I had. We didn\u2019t call him Bryant after he was christened. We called him Bud. We have one daughter, named Charlene. She works for the telephone company in Jacksonville. She called up when she saw your letter in the paper, and she is the only expert about what I ought to say I\u2019ve listened to. She\u2019s a real expert, I figure, because she is Bud\u2019s twin. Bud never married, so Charlene is as close as you can get to Bud. She said you did a good job, showing how your Stepan was a good-hearted man, trying to do what was right, just like anybody else. She said I should show you the same about Bud. And then she started to cry, and she said for me to tell you about Bud and the goldfish. I said, \"What\u2019s the sense of writing somebody in Russia a story like that?\" The story doesn\u2019t prove anything. It\u2019s just one of those silly stories a family will keep telling whenever they get together. Charlene said that was why I should tell it to you, because it would be cute and silly in Russia, too, and you would laugh and like us better.\nSo here goes. When Bud and Charlene were about eight, why I came home one night with a fish bowl and two goldfish. There was one goldfish for each twin, only it was impossible to tell one fish from the other one. They were exactly alike. So one morning Bud got up early, and there was one goldfish floating on top of the water dead. So Bud went and woke up Charlene, and he said, \"Hey, Charlene\u2014your goldfish just died.\" That\u2019s the story Charlene asked me to tell you, Mr. Ivankov.", 0.19123656515897902], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
