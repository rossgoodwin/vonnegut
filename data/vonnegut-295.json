Part of the problem, surely, is that all my books remain in print, and people continue to give me credit for having written them. There is also the confusion caused by Jailbird, which was much too good to have been written by someone at my stage of decay, a red herring, you might say. I am presently working on yet another novel which may mislead readers into believing I should be counted among the living for yet a little while. How greedy of me. How tasteless. How pitiful.\nAs for Palm Sunday, it was quite openly loathed by your paper and some others, and was elsewhere praised with no embarrassment apparent to me. A stranger speaks well of me in The Nation, for example. Another did so in the Los Angeles Times.\nStill, I am sure you are right that there are many critics who went to some trouble to say nice things about a book by me which they did not like at all. I can\u2019t name them, but I\u2019m sure you can. I am sorry to have made them so uncomfortable, and that sentimentality or whatever required them to tell little white lies.\nI am not a critic, but I can imagine what it must be like for a critic to remain seemingly respectful and friendly in the presence of a writer he knows to be all through, to be hollow, to be a man with a paper asshole, so to speak. Here is how I am able to imagine it, and here is how a lot of washed-up writers are able to imagine it\u2014by analogy. A lot of us have found ourselves behaving respectfully and sympathetically and cordially and fraternally and so on when suddenly encountering, God forbid, Anatole Broyard.\nYours truly,\nKurt

he waited for someone to notice him, he interested himself in the radiophoto machine behind glass in one corner, which was fashioning a portrait of a fugitive, and noting beside it a brief biography. The portrait emerged from a slit in the top of the machine bit by bit\u2014first the hair, then the brows, on line with the word WANTED, and then, on line with the large, fey eyes, the name: Edgar Rice Burroughs Hagstrohm, R&R-131313. Hagstrohm\u2019s sordid tale emerged along with his nose: \u201cHagstrohm cut up his M-17 home in Chicago with a blow-torch, went naked to the home of Mrs. Marion Frascati, the widow of an old friend, and demanded that she come to the woods with him. Mrs. Frascati refused, and he disappeared into the bird sanctuary bordering the housing development. There he eluded police, and is believed to have made his escape dropping from a tree onto a passing freight\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou!\u201d said the desk sergeant. \u201cProteus!\u201d\nRegistration involved the filling out of a long, annoyingly complicated form that started with his name and highest classification number, investigated his reasons for having fallen from grace, asked for the names of his closest friends and relatives, and ended with an oath of allegiance to the United States of America. Paul signed the document in the presence of two witnesses, and watched a coding clerk translate it, on a keyboard, into terms the machines could understand. Out came a card, freshly nicked and punched.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d said the police sergeant. He dropped the card into a slot, and the card went racing through a system of switches and sidings, until it came to rest against a thick pile of similar cards.\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d said Paul.\nThe sergeant looked at the pile without interest. \u201cPotential saboteurs.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute\u2014what\u2019s going on here? Who says I am?\u201d\n\u201cNo reflection on you,\u201d said the sergeant patiently. \u201cNobody\u2019s said you are. It\u2019s all automatic.
