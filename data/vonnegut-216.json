While Fred fussed with the box, the rest of us made nervous small talk over sandwiches and beer. Eddie, of course, wasn\u2019t drinking beer, though he was badly in need of a sedative. He was annoyed at having been brought out to the farm instead of to a ball game, and was threatening to take it out on the Bockmans\u2019 Early American furnishings. He was playing a spirited game of flies and grounders with himself near the French doors, using a dead tennis ball and a poker.\n\"Eddie,\" Susan said for the tenth time, \"please stop.\"\n\"It\u2019s under control, under control,\" Eddie said disdainfully, playing the ball off four walls and catching it with one hand.\nMarion, who vents her maternal instincts on her immaculate furnishings, couldn\u2019t hide her distress at Eddie\u2019s turning the place into a gymnasium. Lew, in his way, was trying to calm her. \"Let him wreck the dump,\" Lew said. \"You\u2019ll be moving into a palace one of these days.\"", 0.043518518518518505], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["charley", 0.3261935314328648], ["earl", 0.3101665935657755], ["honor", 0.2089616484076739], ["word", 0.18542768791376038], ["mark", 0.17597792900198245], ["vale", 0.07949314867603847], ["murder", 0.07640424712647224], ["liar", 0.06959104609661068], ["lazy", 0.06959104609661068], ["spit", 0.06959104609661068], ["priceless", 0.06959104609661068], ["brought", 0.06701841664155693], ["curious", 0.0637986874093512], ["ruined", 0.0637986874093512], ["built", 0.059688943517182895], ["crime", 0.05650117849840847], ["dirty", 0.05650117849840847], ["forgot", 0.053896584829923405], ["satan", 0.053896584829923405], ["howes", 0.053896584829923405], ["reading", 0.051694432260962576], ["hedlund", 0.051694432260962576], ["law", 0.051694432260962576], ["yelled", 0.051694432260962576], ["glad", 0.04978684093775511], ["wasn", 0.049596543166674244], ["imagine", 0.048104226142663915], ["tears", 0.04659907591898068], ["poor", 0.04399448225049561], ["kid", 0.04399448225049561], ["gun", 0.04285101499801652], ["shot", 0.04179232968153478], ["dog", 0.04179232968153478], ["hadn", 0.04080671723172119], ["started", 0.03901867233237825], ["top", 0.036696973339552894], ["bad", 0.035999970994275286], ["ten", 0.03533539934234825], ["year", 0.03533539934234825], ["money", 0.03470037416276491], ["paper", 0.03189022710210699], ["couldn", 0.031388922533374566], ["better", 0.028300020983808332], ["thing", 0.021735273421259187]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHe gave his word of honor he brought one,\u201d said Charley.\nEarl started reading again. \u201cThe kid\u2019s not only lazy,\u201d he said, \u201che\u2019s a liar besides.\u201d\nCharley was glad he hadn\u2019t brought his gun along.

Some business I\u2019m in.\n18\nTHE SEXUAL REVOLUTION\nSO I LEFT MY FIRST WIFE and Cape Cod home forever in 1971. All our children save for the youngest, Nanette, had lit out for the Territory, so to speak. I became a soldier in what many were calling a sexual revolution. My departure itself was so sexual that a French name for orgasm describes it to a tee. It was a \u201clittle death.\u201d\nThere were similar little deaths going on all around me, of course, and that continues to be the situation today. In the case of long marriages, such departures really are make-believe dying, a salute to a marriage in its good old days, sheepish acknowledgment that the marriage could have been perfect right up to the end, if only one partner or the other one had managed to die peacefully just a little ahead of time. Can I say this without seeming to praise death? I hope so. I am praising literature, I think\u2014praising stories that satisfy because they end where they should, before they stop being stories.\nI left the house and all its furnishings and the car and the bank accounts behind, and taking only my clothing with me, I departed for New York City, the capital of the World, on a heavier-than-air flying machine. I started all over again.\nAs for real death\u2014it has always been a temptation to me, since my mother solved so many problems with it. The child of a suicide will naturally think of death, the big one, as a logical solution to any problem, even one in simple algebra. Question: If Farmer A can plant 300 potatoes an hour, and Farmer B can plant potatoes fifty percent faster, and Farmer C can plant potatoes one third as fast as Farmer B, and 10,000 potatoes are to be planted to an acre, how many nine-hour days will it take Farmers A, B, and C, working simultaneously, to plant 25 acres?

They are of different generations, but my lawyer was a roommate of the Senator\u2019s son at Reed College out in Portland, Oregon, the town where Tex bought his trusty rifle.\nMy lawyer told me that both sets of the Senator\u2019s racially Japanese grandparents, one set immigrants, the other set native Californians, were put into a concentration camp when this country got into the Finale Rack. The camp, incidentally, was only a few kilometers west of the Donner Pass, named in honor of White cannibals. The feeling back then was that anybody with Japanese genes inside our borders was probably less loyal to the United States Constitution than to Hirohito, the Emperor of Japan.\nThe Senator\u2019s father, however, served in an infantry battalion composed entirely of young Americans of Japanese extraction, which became our most decorated unit taking part in the Italian Campaign during, again, the Finale Rack.\nSo I asked my lawyer to find out from the Ambassador if Hiroshi had left a note, and if there had been an autopsy performed to determine whether or not the deceased had ingested some foreign substance that might have made hara-kiri easier. I don\u2019t know whether to call this friendship or morbid curiosity.\nThe answer came back that there was no note, and that there had been no autopsy, since the cause of death was so horribly obvious. There was this detail: A little girl who didn\u2019t know him was the first person of any age or sex to see what he had chosen to do to himself.\nShe ran and told her mama.\nBACK WHEN WE were neighbors, I asked the Warden why he never left this valley, why he didn\u2019t get away from the prison and me and the ignorant young guards and the bells across the lake and all the rest of it. He had years of leave time he had never used.\nHe said, \u201cI would only meet more people.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like any kind of people?\u201d I said.

No one was playing in it now.\nThere was no one in it to cry, as I should have liked someone to cry:\n\u201cOlly-olly-ox-in-freeeeeee.\u201d\nThere was a stir, a rustle in the shadows of my attic. I imagined it to be the rustle of a rat.\nI was wrong.\nIt was the rustle of Bernard B. O\u2019Hare, the man who had captured me so long ago. It was the stir of my own personal Fury, the man who perceived his noblest aspect in his loathing and hounding of me.\nI do not mean to slander him by associating the sound he made with the sound of a rat. I do not think of O\u2019Hare as a rat, though his actions with regard to me had the same nagging irrelevance as the rats\u2019 scrabbling passions in my attic walls. I didn\u2019t really know O\u2019Hare, and I didn\u2019t want to know him. The fact of his having put me under arrest in Germany was a fact of submicroscopic interest to me. He wasn\u2019t my nemesis. My game was up long before O\u2019Hare took me into custody. To me, O\u2019Hare was simply one more gatherer of windblown trash in the tracks of war.\nO\u2019Hare had a far more exciting view of what we were to each other. When drunk, at any rate, he thought of himself as St. George and of me as the dragon.", 0.06720920138888889], "title": "Mother Night"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["bail", 0.15823227510413115], ["adam", 0.08092420362833513], ["court", 0.07830594102785429], ["coup", 0.05953965229510201], ["induce", 0.05953965229510201], ["overthrown", 0.05953965229510201], ["clownishness", 0.05953965229510201], ["monstrous", 0.05953965229510201], ["desperado", 0.05953965229510201], ["historians", 0.05953965229510201], ["reduction", 0.05953965229510201], ["augusto", 0.05953965229510201], ["salvador", 0.05953965229510201], ["allende", 0.05953965229510201], ["endanger", 0.05953965229510201], ["trial", 0.05953965229510201], ["pinochet", 0.05953965229510201], ["junta", 0.05953965229510201], ["democratically", 0.05953965229510201], ["recognizing", 0.05953965229510201], ["troubles", 0.052744091701377054], ["capacities", 0.052744091701377054], ["carter", 0.052744091701377054], ["drastic", 0.052744091701377054], ["administrations", 0.052744091701377054], ["interests", 0.052744091701377054], ["weapon", 0.052744091701377054], ["injustice", 0.04876894358266956], ["hoffman", 0.04876894358266956], ["lowered", 0.04876894358266956], ["effective", 0.04876894358266956], ["elected", 0.04876894358266956], ["enemy", 0.0459485311076521], ["recognized", 0.0459485311076521], ["behaved", 0.0459485311076521], ["chile", 0.0459485311076521], ["require", 0.0459485311076521], ["yarmolinsky", 0.04376084923202259], ["military", 0.04376084923202259], ["regard", 0.04376084923202259], ["kennedy", 0.0419733829889446], ["leader", 0.0419733829889446], ["deserves", 0.0419733829889446], ["released", 0.0419733829889446], ["truth", 0.04046210181416757], ["appear", 0.04046210181416757], ["led", 0.04046210181416757], ["control", 0.04046210181416757], ["responsible", 0.039152970513927146], ["johnson", 0.039152970513927146], ["legal", 0.036965288638297636], ["wild", 0.036965288638297636], ["pepe", 0.03603087511080426], ["served", 0.03517782239521965], ["community", 0.03439308996704773], ["form", 0.03439308996704773], ["9", 0.03366654122044261], ["began", 0.03299014051959014], ["society", 0.03235740992020219], ["jos", 0.03235740992020219], ["perfectly", 0.03235740992020219], ["study", 0.031763050882786165], ["attention", 0.030672603479744747], ["president", 0.030672603479744747], ["brought", 0.030169728044572686], ["donoso", 0.029691393101735117], ["easy", 0.029235314517079305], ["harvard", 0.029235314517079305], ["imagine", 0.029235314517079305], ["mind", 0.0287995129232476], ["1973", 0.0283822618014947], ["professor", 0.027227526157804664], ["general", 0.02619457992586519], ["11", 0.025561849326477235], ["left", 0.02468329875108815], ["cod", 0.023622381254615278], ["september", 0.022665141356929826], ["cape", 0.022219431807157696], ["met", 0.02200395232952265], ["country", 0.020992342170353714], ["jr", 0.02080196877959782], ["high", 0.02025207204772484], ["best", 0.01956379500190868], ["october", 0.01956379500190868], ["american", 0.017476324440706018], ["friend", 0.017081482292294843], ["jane", 0.01621768555199811], ["man", 0.015315539486113281], ["life", 0.013636404970354754], ["years", 0.01152161504068131], ["people", 0.01144872309472525], ["vonnegut", 0.010046331433036808], ["city", 0.005645846164776498], ["york", 0.005446976839565658], ["kurt", 0.004901934090536984], ["dear", 0.0031418813262232533]], "sentiment": ["I have known Mr. Hoffman for several years, and it should be brought to the attention of the Court that he is not a desperado who would endanger the community, if he were released on lowered bail.
