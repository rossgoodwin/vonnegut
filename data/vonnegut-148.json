He wished me well without shaking my hand, and was gone. He never touched me, never gave any indication that he knew that I, too, had played a very public part in American history in olden times.\nSo there I was in a limousine again. Why not? Anything was possible in a dream. Hadn\u2019t Roy M. Cohn just gotten me out of jail, and hadn\u2019t I left my shoes behind? So why shouldn\u2019t the dream go on\u2014and have Leland Clewes and Israel Edel, the night clerk at the Arapahoe, already sitting in the back of the limousine, with a space between them for me? This it did.\nThey nodded to me uneasily. They, too, felt that life wasn\u2019t making good sense just now.\nWhat was going on, of course, was that the limousine was cruising around Manhattan like a schoolbus, picking up people Mary Kathleen O\u2019Looney had told Arpad Leen to hire as RAMJAC vice-presidents. This was Leen\u2019s personal limousine. It was what I have since learned is called a \u201cstretch\u201d limousine. The American Harp Company could have used the backseat for a showroom.\nClewes and Edel and the next person we were going to pick up had all been telephoned personally by Leen\u2014after some of his assistants had found out more about who they were and where they were. Leland Clewes had been found in the phonebook. Edel had been found behind the desk at the Arapahoe. One of the assistants had gone to the Coffee Shop of the Royalton to ask for the name of a person who worked there and had a French-fried hand.\nOther calls had gone to Georgia\u2014one to the RAMJAC regional office, asking if they had a chauffeur named Cleveland Lawes working for them, and another to the Federal Minimum Security Adult Correctional Facility at Finletter Air Force Base, asking if they had a guard named Clyde Carter and a prisoner named Dr. Robert Fender there.\nClewes asked me if I understood what was going on.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is just the dream of a jailbird.

We were the first to sign the register of the Casa Mona.\nThe Crosbys got to the desk ahead of me, but H. Lowe Crosby was so startled by a wholly blank register that he couldn\u2019t bring himself to sign. He had to think about it a while.\n\u201cYou sign,\u201d he said to me. And then, defying me to think he was superstitious, he declared his wish to photograph a man who was making a huge mosaic on the fresh plaster of the lobby wall.\nThe mosaic was a portrait of Mona Aamons Monzano. It was twenty feet high. The man who was working on it was young and muscular. He sat at the top of a stepladder. He wore nothing but a pair of white duck trousers.\nHe was a white man.\nThe mosaicist was making the fine hairs on the nape of Mona\u2019s swan neck out of chips of gold.\nCrosby went over to photograph him; came back to report that the man was the biggest pissant he had ever met. Crosby was the color of tomato juice when he reported this. \u201cYou can\u2019t say a damn thing to him that he won\u2019t turn inside out.\u201d\nSo I went over to the mosaicist, watched him for a while, and then I told him, \u201cI envy you.\u201d\n\u201cI always knew,\u201d he sighed, \u201cthat, if I waited long enough, somebody would come and envy me.

Most of the time it was an exhilarating secret, and he extracted momentary highs of joy from it while dealing with fellow members of the system in the course of his job. At the beginning and close of each item of business he thought, \u201cTo hell with you.\u201d\nIt was to hell with them, to hell with everything. This secret detachment gave him a delightful sense of all the world\u2019s being a stage. Waiting until the time when he and Anita would be in mental shape to quit and start a better life, Paul acted out his role as manager of the Ilium Works. Outwardly, as manager, he was unchanged; but inwardly he was burlesquing smaller, less free souls who would have taken the job seriously.\nHe had never been a reading man, but now he was developing an appetite for novels wherein the hero lived vigorously and out-of-doors, dealing directly with nature, dependent upon basic cunning and physical strength for survival\u2014woodsmen, sailors, cattlemen\u2026.\nHe read of these heroes with a half-smile on his lips. He knew his enjoyment of them was in a measure childish, and he doubted that a life could ever be as clean, hearty, and satisfying as those in the books. Still and all, there was a basic truth underlying the tales, a primitive ideal to which he could aspire. He wanted to deal, not with society, but only with Earth as God had given it to man.\n\u201cIs that a good book, Doctor Proteus?\u201d said Doctor Katharine Finch, his secretary. She\u2019d come into his office carrying a large gray cardboard box.\n\u201cOh\u2014hello, Katharine.\u201d He laid the book down with a smile. \u201cNot great literature; I\u2019ll promise you that. Pleasant relaxation is all. All about bargemen on the old Erie Ship Canal.\u201d He tapped the broad, naked chest of the hero on the book jacket. \u201cDon\u2019t make men like that any more. Well, what\u2019s in the box? That for me?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s your shirts.

["Hisako Hiroguchi and her furry daughter Akiko and Selena MacIntosh all called her \u201cthe Walloping Window Blind,\u201d and so did the Kanka-bono women, who loved the sound of the words without understanding them. And when the Kanka-bono women bore children, which they hadn\u2019t done yet, they would teach their young that they themselves had come from the mainland on a magic ship, since vanished, called \u201cthe Walloping Window Blind.\u201d\nAkiko, who was fluent in Kanka-bono as well as English and Japanese, and who was the only non-Kanka-bono who could converse with the Kanka-bonos, would never find a satisfactory way to translate this into Kanka-bono: \u201cthe Walloping Window Blind.\u201d\nThe Kanka-bonos could no more understand it and its comical intent than could a modern person, if I were to whisper in his or her ear as he or she basked on a white sandy beach by a blue lagoon: \u201cthe Walloping Window Blind.\u201d\nIt was soon after the Walloping Window Blind went to the bottom that Mary began her artificial insemination program. She was then sixty-one. She was the sole sexual partner of the Captain, who was sixty-six, and whose sexual drive was no longer all that compelling. And he was determined not to reproduce, since he felt that there was still a good chance that he could pass on Huntington\u2019s chorea. Also, he was a racist, and so not at all drawn to Hisako or her furry daughter, and least of all to the Indian women who would ultimately bear his children.\nRemember: These people were expecting to be rescued at any time, and had no way of knowing that they were the last hope for the human race. So that they engaged in sexual activities simply to pass some of the time pleasantly, to relieve an itch, or to make themselves sleepy, or what you will. So far as anybody knew, reproducing would actually be irresponsible, since Santa Rosalia was no place to raise children, and children would also place strains on the food supply.\nMary felt this as strongly as anyone before the Walloping Window Blind joined the Ecuadorian fleet of submarines: that it would be a tragedy if a child were born.\nHer soul continued to feel that, but her big brain began to wonder, idly, so as not to spook her, if the sperm which the Captain squirted into her about twice a month could be transferred to a fertile woman somehow\u2014with, hey presto, a resulting pregnancy. Akiko, who was only ten then, wasn\u2019t yet ovulating. But the Kanka-bono women, who ranged in age from fifteen to nineteen, surely were.\nMary\u2019s big brain told her what she had so often told her students: that there was no harm, and possibly a lot of good, in people\u2019s playing with all sorts of ideas in their heads, no matter how supposedly impossible or impractical or downright crazy they seemed to be. She reassured herself there on Santa Rosalia, as she had reassured the adolescents of Ilium, that mental games played with even the trashiest ideas had led to many of the most significant scientific insights of what she, a million years ago, called \u201cmodern times.\u201d\nShe consulted Mandarax about curiosity.\nQuoth Mandarax:", 0.12151162790697674], "title": "Galapagos"}, "god-bless-you-mr-rosewater": {"tfidf": [["beard", 0.372802643115536], ["redeeming", 0.31719836345211416], ["shaved", 0.31719836345211416], ["stamps", 0.31719836345211416], ["job", 0.24853509541035734], ["trout", 0.23533354291615222], ["sacrilege", 0.15859918172605708], ["hungry", 0.15859918172605708], ["demoralized", 0.15859918172605708], ["figure", 0.1369383323335588], ["applied", 0.1369383323335588], ["suppose", 0.12426754770517867], ["mildly", 0.12426754770517867], ["replied", 0.10830424696249145], ["jesus", 0.10260669831268038], ["declared", 0.09361663354856221], ["hired", 0.08993591368430023], ["friend", 0.07844451430538407], ["happened", 0.07844451430538407], ["knew", 0.05678366491288577], ["asked", 0.05678366491288577], ["thing", 0.038954138085772874], ["senator", 0.03171033764648149], ["eliot", 0.012866710035054995]], "sentiment": ["\"Redeeming stamps,\" Trout mildly replied.\n\"Mr. Trout,\" said Eliot, \"what happened to your beard?\"\n\"That was the first thing you asked me.\"\n\"Tell me again.\"\n\"I was hungry and demoralized.

Number Two: \u201cI was captured when the war had only a few more months to go,\u201d I said. \u201cI was patched up in a hospital and then sent to a camp south of Dresden, where they were practically out of food. Everything in what was left of Germany had been eaten up. So we were all getting skinnier and skinnier except for the man we\u2019d elected to divide what food there was into equal shares.\n\u201cThere was never a time when he had the food to himself. We saw it delivered, and then he divided it up with all of us watching. Still, he somehow remained sleek and contended-looking while the rest of us became skeletons.\n\u201cHe was feasting absentmindedly on crumbs and dribblings that fell on the tabletop and clung to his knife and ladle.\u201d\nThis same innocent phenomenon, by the way, explains the great prosperity of many of my neighbors up and down the beach here.

We were halted at about three in the morning, and told to sleep under the stars as best we could.\n\u201cWhen we awoke at sunrise, the guards were gone, and we found that we were on the rim of a valley near the ruins of an ancient stone watchtower. Below us, in that innocent farmland, were thousands upon thousands of people like us, who had been brought there by their guards, had been dumped. These weren\u2019t only prisoners of war.

The main thing is to get rid of loneliness. I certainly sympathize.\n\u201cI have not mentioned love yet. I have been saving that for close to the end.\n\u201cLove was invented by a chef at the Brown Derby Restaurant in Hollywood, California, in 1939. It consists of overripe jumbo peaches with San Fernando Valley honey and chocolate jimmies on top. It is traditionally served in heated purple bowls.\n\u201cAs every married person here knows, love is a rotten substitute for respect.\n\u201cI have spoken of the long tradition of religious skepticism in my family. One of my two daughters has recently turned her back on all that. Living alone and far from home, she has memorized an arbitrary Christian creed, Trinitarian-ism, by chance. She now has her human dignity regularly confirmed by the friendly nods of a congregation. I am glad that she is not so lonely anymore. This is more than all right with me.\n\u201cShe believes that Jesus was the Son of God, or perhaps God Himself\u2014or however that goes. I have had even more trouble with the Trinity than I had with college algebra. I refer those who are curious about it to what is known about the Council of Nicea, which took place in anno Domini 325. It was there that the Trinity was hammered into its present shape. Unfortunately, the minutes have been lost. It is known that the emperor Constantine was there, and probably spoke a good deal. He gave us the first Christian army. He may have given us the Holy Ghost as well.\n\u201cNo matter. I do not argue with my Christian daughter about religion at all. Why should I? I have, however, begun to write a passion play for her which leaves God out entirely, but which manages to be spiritual anyway. It is still about Jesus Christ.\n\u201cI will tell you only about the last scene:\n\u201cThe Roman soldiers, using ancient police methods, have done all they can to prove to Jesus that he has absolutely no dignity, so far as they can see.
