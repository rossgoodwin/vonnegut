He raised or gathered or made everything he needed. This satisfied him enormously.\nBeatrice was not dependent on Constant. Rumfoord had stocked the Taj Mahal lavishly with Earthling food and Earthling liquor. Beatrice had plenty to eat and drink, and always would have.\nConstant was bringing native foods to Beatrice because he was so proud of his skills as a woodsman and husbandman.

The dog was friendly, as all Labrador retrievers are, and he followed Frank and little Newt home.\nFelix Hoenikker died\u2014died in his white wicker chair looking out at the sea\u2014while his children were gone. All day the old man had been teasing his children with hints about ice-nine, showing it to them in a little bottle on whose label he had drawn a skull and cross-bones, and on whose label he had written: \u201cDanger! Ice-nine! Keep away from moisture!\u201d\nAll day long the old man had been nagging his children with words like these, merry in tone: \u201cCome on now, stretch your minds a little. I\u2019ve told you that its melting point is a hundred fourteen-point-four degrees Fahrenheit, and I\u2019ve told you that it\u2019s composed of nothing but hydrogen and oxygen. What could the explanation be? Think a little! Don\u2019t be afraid of straining your brains. They won\u2019t break.\u201d\n\u201cHe was always telling us to stretch our brains,\u201d said Frank, recalling olden times.\n\u201cI gave up trying to stretch my brain when I-don\u2019t-know-how-old-I-was,\u201d Angela confessed, leaning on her broom. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even listen to him when he talked about science. I\u2019d just nod and pretend I was trying to stretch my brain, but that poor brain, as far as science went, didn\u2019t have any more stretch than an old garter belt.\u201d\nApparently, before he sat down in his wicker chair and died, the old man played puddly games in the kitchen with water and pots and pans and ice-nine. He must have been converting water to ice-nine and back to water again, for every pot and pan was out on the kitchen countertops. A meat thermometer was out, too, so the old man must have been taking the temperature of things.\nThe old man meant to take only a brief time out in his chair, for he left quite a mess in the kitchen. Part of the disorder was a saucepan filled with solid ice-nine. He no doubt meant to melt it up, to reduce the world\u2019s supply of the blue-white stuff to a splinter in a bottle again\u2014after a brief time out.\nBut, as Bokonon tells us, \u201cAny man can call time out, but no man can say how long the time out will be.\u201d\n112", -0.01915219907407407], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["bartender", 0.33685240372488356], ["guest", 0.1645971293342023], ["crude", 0.1645971293342023], ["prim", 0.11266531773189553], ["vaulted", 0.11266531773189553], ["ultimately", 0.11266531773189553], ["justice", 0.11266531773189553], ["fetid", 0.11266531773189553], ["jim", 0.09958706904208524], ["sir", 0.09226042698770948], ["observed", 0.09193678398344061], ["privileges", 0.09193678398344061], ["ruling", 0.09193678398344061], ["bourbon", 0.08650882035227495], ["sonny", 0.08650882035227495], ["incident", 0.08650882035227495], ["suggestion", 0.08650882035227495], ["spun", 0.07885853529363034], ["serve", 0.07885853529363034], ["primitive", 0.07885853529363034], ["atmosphere", 0.0759500319006632], ["prepared", 0.0759500319006632], ["satisfaction", 0.0759500319006632], ["level", 0.0759500319006632], ["dignity", 0.07120825023498571], ["learn", 0.067422010697964], ["longer", 0.067422010697964], ["change", 0.06578028660382004], ["rank", 0.06427004683639483], ["lived", 0.06427004683639483], ["move", 0.0628717832108529], ["number", 0.06035232297265437], ["social", 0.06035232297265437], ["bar", 0.057109865294792866], ["leave", 0.055221498152208295], ["water", 0.05270203791400975], ["moment", 0.0466934769495091], ["meadows", 0.04126551331834342], ["told", 0.04126551331834342], ["voice", 0.03811354945677425], ["wasn", 0.034492964403753386], ["turned", 0.03361522825969881], ["people", 0.027763248480381083], ["kroner", 0.026156497379620575], ["paul", 0.005621482502244719]], "sentiment": ["\u201cBourbon and water,\u201d he said to the bartender.\n\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d\n\u201cSorry about what?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t serve you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told you\u2019re no longer a guest at the Meadows, sir.\u201d There was a prim satisfaction in the bartender\u2019s voice.\nA number of people observed the incident, Kroner among them, but no one made a move to change the bartender\u2019s ruling.\nIt was a crude moment, and in its fetid atmosphere Paul made an ultimately crude suggestion to the bartender, and turned to leave with dignity.\nWhat he still had to learn was that without rank, without guest privileges, he lived on a primitive level of social justice.

One of them looked up and saw David, and winked in tango rhythm. David fled.\nAt the mouth of the alley, he stopped a man and asked him if he\u2019d heard anything about a deer in the Works. The man shook his head and looked at David oddly, making David aware of how frantic he must look. \"I heard it was out by the lab,\" David said more calmly.\n\"Which lab?\" said the man.\n\"That\u2019s what I\u2019m not sure of,\" said David. \"There\u2019s more than one?\"\n\"Chemical lab?\" said the man. \"Materials testing lab?

He stopped several other people, none of whom knew anything about the deer, and he tried to retrace his steps to the office of his supervisor, whatever his name was. He was swept this way and that by the currents of the Works, stranded in backwaters, sucked back into the main stream, and his mind was more and more numbed, and the mere reflexes of self-preservation were more and more in charge.\nHe chose a building at random, and walked inside for a momentary respite from the summer heat, and was deafened by the clangor of steel sheets being cut and punched, being smashed into strange shapes by great hammers that dropped out of the smoke and dust overhead. A hairy, heavily muscled man was seated near the door on a wooden stool, watching a giant lathe turn a bar of steel the size of a silo.\nDavid now had the idea of going through a company phone directory until he recognized his supervisor\u2019s name. He called to the machinist from a few feet away, but his voice was lost in the din.

Then it stopped. Louis C. Reinbeck sat on a white iron chair on the lawn in the moonlight. He was looking out at the rolling lovely nonsense of the golf course and, beyond that and below, the town. All the lights in his house were out. He thought his wife, Natalie, was asleep.\nLouis was drinking. He was thinking that the moonlight didn\u2019t make the world look any better. He thought the moonlight made the world look worse, made it look dead like the moon.\nThe telephone\u2019s ringing twice, then stopping, fitted in well with Louis\u2019s mood. The telephone was a good touch\u2014urgency that could wait until hell froze over. \u201cShatter the night and then hang up,\u201d said Louis.\nAlong with the house and the Reinbeck Abrasives Company, Louis had inherited from his father and grandfather a deep and satisfying sense of having been corrupted by commerce. And like them, Louis thought of himself as a sensitive maker of porcelain, not grinding wheels, born in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nJust as the telephone had rung twice at the right time, so did Louis\u2019s wife appear as though on cue. Natalie was a cool, spare Boston girl. Her role was to misunderstand Louis. She did it beautifully, taking apart his reflective moods like a master mechanic.", 0.07632731253420909], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
