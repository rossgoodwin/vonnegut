"sentiment": ["I was feeling as I feel now, like whalers Herman Melville described, who didn\u2019t talk anymore. They had said absolutely everything they could ever say.\nI told Trout in 2001 about a redheaded boyhood friend of mine, David Craig, now a builder in New Orleans, Louisiana, who won a Bronze Star in our war for knocking out a German tank in Normandy. He and a buddy came upon this steel monster parked all alone in a woods. Its engine wasn\u2019t running. There wasn\u2019t anybody outside. A radio was playing popular music inside.\nDave and his buddy fetched a bazooka. When they got back, the tank was still there. A radio was still playing music inside. They shot the tank with the bazooka. Germans didn\u2019t pop out of the turret. The radio stopped playing. That was all. That was it.\nDave and his buddy skedaddled away from there.\nTrout said it sounded to him as though my boyhood friend\u2019s Bronze Star was well deserved. \u201cHe almost certainly killed people as well as a radio,\u201d he said, \u201cthus sparing them years of disappointments and tedium in civilian life. He made it possible for them, to quote the English poet A. E. Housman, to \u2018die in their glory and never be old.\u2019 \u201d\nTrout paused, secured his upper plate with his left thumb, and then went on: \u201cI could have written a best-seller, if I\u2019d had the patience to create three-dimensional characters. The Bible may be the Greatest Story Ever Told, but the most popular story you can ever tell is about a good-looking couple having a really swell time copulating outside wedlock, and having to quit for one reason or another while doing it is still a novelty.\u201d\nI was reminded of Steve Adams, one of my sister Allie\u2019s three sons my first wife Jane and I adopted after Allie\u2019s unlucky husband Jim died in a railroad train that went off an open drawbridge in New Jersey, and then, two days later, Allie died of cancer of the everything.\nWhen Steve came home to Cape Cod for Christmas vacation from his freshman year at Dartmouth, he was close to tears because he had just read, having been forced to do so by a professor, A Farewell to Arms, by Ernest Hemingway.\nSteve, now a middle-aged comedy writer for movies and TV, was so gorgeously wrecked back then that I was moved to reread what it was that had done this to him.

When his second wife died, when he brought out The White Christian Minute-man again, he appeared on the masthead as, \u201cThe Reverend Doctor Lionel J. D. Jones, D.D.S., D.D.\u201d\nAnd he wrote and published at his own expense a book that combined not only dentistry and theology, but the fine arts as well. The name of the book was Christ Was Not a Jew. He proved his point by reproducing in the book fifty famous paintings of Jesus. According to Jones, not one painting showed Jewish jaws or teeth.\nThe first issues in the new series of The White Christian Minuteman were as unreadable as those of the old series. But then a miracle happened. The Minute-man jumped from four pages to eight. The make-up, the typography and the paper became snappy and handsome. Dental diagrams were replaced by newsy photographs, and the pages crackled with datelines and bylines from all over the world.\nThe explanation was simple\u2014and obvious. Jones had been recruited and financed as a propaganda agent for Hitler\u2019s then-rising Third German Reich. Jones\u2019 news, photographs, cartoons and editorials were coming straight from the Nazi propaganda mills in Erfurt, Germany.\nIt is quite possible, incidentally, that much of his more scurrilous material was written by me.\nJones continued as a German propaganda agent even after the United States of America entered the Second World War. He wasn\u2019t arrested until July in 1942, when he was indicted with twenty-seven others for:\nConspiring to destroy the morale and faith and confidence of the members of the military and naval forces of the United States and the people of the United States in their public officials and republican form of government; conspiring to seize upon and use and misuse the right of freedom of speech and of the press to spread their disloyal doctrines, intending and believing that any nation allowing its people the right of freedom of speech is powerless to defend itself against enemies masquerading as patriotic; and seeking to obstruct, impede, break down and destroy the proper functioning of its republican form of government under the guise of honest criticism; conspiring to render the Government of the United States bereft of the faith and confidence of the members of the military and naval forces and of the people, and thereby render that government powerless to defend the nation or the people against armed attack from without or treachery from within.\nJones was convicted. He was sentenced to fourteen years, served eight. When he was freed from Atlanta in 1950, he was a wealthy man. Viverine, his embalming fluid, and Gingiva-Tru, his counterfeit gum substance for false teeth, had both come to dominate their respective markets.\nIn 1955, he resumed publication of The White Christian Minuteman.\nFive years after that, a lively elder statesman of seventy-one, an alert old man with no regrets, the Reverend Doctor Lionel J.D.

1977, found plenty of laxatives in and around Columbia. Not the least of these was the comedy club only eight blocks away. There was also the miasma from a gruesomely moronic ten-year war, ended at last and lost, which never should have been fought at all: Vietnam. Berman and his classmates, God knows, did not regret having been too young to have fought in that war. It was mostly working-class kids who did that. But they were achingly envious of what Berman would come to call \u201cthe draft-dodging students who had raised such particular hell at Columbia while trying to get their government to stop the war. Some of them had sustained bruises, in fact, from the truncheons of anti-intellectual law-enforcement personnel, or from brickbats hurled by members of the lower social orders in the building trades.\u201d\nAnd drugs were everywhere. Berman on this subject: \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to leave the campus and go all the way to the nearest bodega or pizzeria for synthetic accomplishments and popularity. Then as now, the motto of every college, jail, prison, and YMCA in the United States should have been: \u2018TV is not enough,\u2019 or, \u2018Why put up with the pain of being a living thing when you don\u2019t have to?\u2019 Or, \u2018Have a snort, and feel bulletproof for fifteen minutes!\u2019\u201d\nHe was an only child. Who was his mother, now dead? After her one marriage, she kept her maiden name, which was Magda Lanz, and she lived, in Berman\u2019s words, \u201cfrom breech birth to long-widowed death in the Knightsbridge mansion built by her father.\u201d That she had come into the world butt foremost, almost killing her own mother by doing that, was no family secret. Her mother\u2014Berman\u2019s grandmother, Sarah\u2014found an occasion almost every day to recall for him the agony she had gone through in order that he might have a mother.\nAnd his mother was permanently deranged by the postpartum depression and electroconvulsive therapy she suffered after giving birth to him, not to mention the nonstop dry heaves before that. So one is tempted to suggest that Gil Berman found chastity more reasonable than most people in good health would because his grandmother and then his mother had gone through such hell as a result of copulation. Is it possible that his grandmother\u2019s tales and his mother\u2019s wails made young Gilbert Lanz Berman, for that was his full name, see sex as calamity\u2019s overture?\nWhat scotches this theory, in part, if not entirely, is Berman\u2019s own testimony that he \u201cmade the fur and feathers fly, you can bet your ass, split three cherries, two engagements, and a marriage, before I was twenty-four.\u201d Theory number two: VD?\nHis mother\u2019s father was Gilbert Lanz, briefly America\u2019s ambassador to Israel, who made a great deal of money honorably in Boston real estate and was the most generous individual supporter of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He died while Berman was still a fetus, and so he was spared the unbearable dissonance of his daughter\u2019s insanity. But he sure did hear her dry heaves. His own wife, Sarah\u2014whose major sexual escapade, to hear her tell it, was a breech birth\u2014was dead. He left his unseen and only grandson $10 million in 1958, and ten times that much to his daughter. Another legacy of value to his grandson, as an armature for him to hang jokes on, was the inscription he had requested for his tombstone, which read, in full: \u201cAmbassador Gilbert Lanz (1883\u20131958): The only proof he needed of the existence of God was music.\u201d The armature: \u201cThe only proof so-and-so needed of the existence of God was such-and-such.\u201d Using the late disgraced President Richard Nixon as an example: \u201cThe only proof Nixon needed of the existence of God was a pardon.\u201d Berman on himself: \u201cThe only proof I need of the existence of God is a third World War.\u201d\nThe ambassador himself was no musician. By his own admission he \u201ccould scarcely whistle \u2018Hot Cross Buns,\u2019\u201d although his mother was said to have played a harp when she was young, before he had a chance to hear her pluck those strings. There was no harp in the house when he was born. The ambassador was an avid golfer. Berman again: \u201cThe only proof my maternal grandfather needed of the existence of God was a birdie.\u201d\nAnd what a gift from God it seemed, and indeed should have seemed, to Gilbert Lanz when his daughter Magda revealed herself as a piano prodigy at the age of seven. The most famous piano teacher in the Boston area was Frederika Tanzen Schild-knecht, who gladly took little Magda as her pupil, and who said she might indeed be another Mozart. At the age of eight Magda Lanz performed with the Boston Pops Orchestra, sharing the stage and applause with two other prodigies, Akkoda Akiri and Marissa Lotspiech, of whom nothing more would be heard. Berman would say of his mother, there in Northampton: \u201cLike ninety-nine point ninety-nine percent of great artists of every sort since the dawn of history, my dear mother, Magda, fell victim to audience shortages and a talent glut.\u201d\nHe said of talent in general: \u201cBeware of gods bearing gifts.\u201d\nSo, although Magda Lanz continued to practice piano for three hours every day, until botched shock treatments following the birth of a comedian zapped her memory and aplomb to flinders, she set out to become a physician. She attended Knightsbridge\u2019s superb public schools and then drove daily in her own Mercedes convertible to and from Boston University, where she studied premedicine. A plain woman, and somewhat dumpy, albeit coming and going in a $60,000 form of transportation, she fell in love with a pretty-faced, redheaded, baritone, predental student: Bob \u201cPaddy\u201d Berman. As luck would have it, this \u201cparagon of manly schmaltz,\u201d as his own son would come to call him, was also a former Junior Golf Champion of Barnstable County, Cape Cod, where his folks lived. His dad owned a shoe store in Hyannis. It isn\u2019t there anymore.

He was twelve years old, quaking as he stood with his mother and father on Bright Angel Point, at the rim of the Grand Canyon. The little human family was staring at the floor of the canyon, one mile straight down.\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d said Billy\u2019s father, manfully kicking a pebble into space, \u201cthere it is.\u201d They had come to this famous place by automobile. They had had seven blowouts on the way.\n\u201cIt was worth the trip,\u201d said Billy\u2019s mother raptly. \u201cOh, God\u2014was it ever worth it.\u201d\nBilly hated the canyon. He was sure that he was going to fall in. His mother touched him, and he wet his pants.\nThere were other tourists looking down into the canyon, too, and a ranger was there to answer questions. A Frenchman who had come all the way from France asked the ranger in broken English if many people committed suicide by jumping in.\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said the ranger. \u201cAbout three folks a year.\u201d So it goes.\nAnd Billy took a very short trip through time, made a peewee jump of only ten days, so he was still twelve, still touring the West with his family. Now they were down in Carlsbad Caverns, and Billy was praying to God to get him out of there before the ceiling fell in.\nA ranger was explaining that the Caverns had been discovered by a cowboy who saw a huge cloud of bats come out of a hole in the ground. And then he said that he was going to turn out all the lights, and that it would probably be the first time in the lives of most people there that they had ever been in darkness that was total.\nOut went the lights.

The chamber was a guest room and not Gregory\u2019s and Marilee\u2019s bedroom. Imprisoning me there for six hours was subtle sadism of a high order indeed. For one thing, Jones, with a perfectly straight face, indicated that this was to be my bedroom during my apprenticeship, as though anybody but a person as lowborn as myself would find it a perfectly ordinary place to sleep. For another: I didn\u2019t dare touch anything. Just to be sure I didn\u2019t, Jones said to me, \u201cPlease be as quiet as possible, and don\u2019t touch anything.\u201d\nOne might have thought they were trying to get rid of me.\nI have just given this snap quiz to Celeste and her friends out by the tennis courts: \u201cIdentify the following persons in history: \u2018W. C. Fields, the Empress Josephine, Booth Tarkington, and Al Jolson.\u2019\u201d\nThe only one they got was W. C. Fields, whose old movies are shown on TV.\nAnd I say I never met Fields, but that first night I tiptoed out of my gilded cage and to the top of the spiral staircase to listen to the arrival of the famous guests. I heard the unmistakable bandsaw twang of Fields as he introduced the woman with him to Gregory with these words: \u201cThis, my child, is Dan Gregory, the love child of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s sister and a sawed-off Arapahoe.\u201d\nI complained to Slazinger and Mrs. Berman at supper last night that the young people of today seemed to be trying to get through life with as little information as possible. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know anything about the Vietnam War or the Empress Josephine, or what a Gorgon is,\u201d I said.\nMrs. Berman defended them.

His arrival, like the arrival of any new prisoner, would be a public execution of sorts. I did not want to watch him or anybody become less than a man. So I was all alone in the supply room. I was grateful for the accident of privacy. I took advantage of it. I performed what was perhaps the most obscenely intimate physical act of my life. I gave birth to a broken, querulous little old man by doing this: by putting on my civilian clothes.\nThere were white broadcloth underpants and calf-length, ribbed black socks from the Tally-ho Gentleman\u2019s Shop in Chevy Chase. There was a white Arrow shirt from Garfinckel\u2019s Department Store in Washington. There was the Brooks Brothers suit from New York City, and a regimental-stripe tie and black shoes from there, too. The laces on both shoes were broken and mended with square knots. Fender obviously had not taken a close look at them, or there would have been new laces in those shoes.\nThe necktie was the most antique item. I had actually worn it during the Second World War. Imagine that. An Englishman I was working with on medical supply schemes for the D-Day landings told me that the tie identified me as an officer in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers.\n\u201cYou were wiped out in the Second Battle of the Somme in the First World War,\u201d he said, \u201cand now, in this show, you\u2019ve been wiped out again at E1 Alamein. You might say, \u2018Not the luckiest regiment in the world.\u2019\u201d\nThe stripe scheme is this: A broad band of pale blue is bordered by a narrow band of forest-green above and orange below. I am wearing that tie on this very day, as I sit here in my office in the Down Home Records Division of the RAMJAC Corporation.\nWhen Clyde Carter and Dr. Fender returned to the supply room, I was a civilian again. I felt as dazed and shy and tremble-legged as any other newborn creature. I did not yet know what I looked like. There was one full-length mirror in the supply room, but its face was turned to the wall. Fender always turned it to the wall when a new arrival was expected. This was another example of Fender\u2019s delicacy. The new arrival, if he did not wish to, did not have to see at once how he had been transformed by a prison uniform.\nClyde\u2019s and Fender\u2019s faces, however, were mirrors enough to tell me that I was something less than a gay boulevardier on the order of, say, the late Maurice Chevalier. They were quick to cover their pity with horseplay; but not quick enough.\nFender pretended to be my valet in an embassy somewhere. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Ambassador. Another crisp and bright day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe queen is expecting you for lunch at one.\u201d\nClyde said that it sure was easy to spot a Harvard man, that they all had that certain something. But neither friend made a move to turn the mirror around, so I did it myself.\nHere is who I saw reflected: a scrawny old janitor of Slavic extraction. He was unused to wearing a suit and a tie. His shirt collar much too large for him, and so was his suit, which fit him like a circus tent. He looked unhappy\u2014on his way to a relative\u2019s funeral, perhaps.

One senior\u2019s stepmother said, I remember, that she thought she had landed in Yokohama instead of Rochester because there were so many Japanese. The thing was that the changing of the guard at Athena had coincided with Graduation Day. New guards, mostly country boys from Hokkaido, who spoke no English and had never seen the United States, were flown directly to Rochester from Tokyo every 6 months, and taken to Athena by bus. And then those who had served 6 months at the gates, and on the walls and catwalks over the mess halls, and in the watchtowers, and so on, were flown straight home.\n\u201cHOW COME YOU haven\u2019t gone home, Kimberley?\u201d I said.\nShe said that she and her father wanted to hear the graduation address, which was to be delivered by her father\u2019s close friend and fellow Rhodes Scholar, Dr. Martin Peale Blankenship, the University of Chicago economist who would later become a quadriplegic as a result of a skiing accident in Switzerland.\nDr. Blankenship had a niece in the graduating class. That was what brought him to Scipio. His niece was Hortense Mellon. I have no idea what became of Hortense. She could play the harp. I remember that, and her upper teeth were false. The real teeth were knocked out by a mugger as she left a friend\u2019s coming-out party at the Waldorf-Astoria, which has since burned down. There is nothing but a vacant lot there now, which was bought by the Japanese.\nI heard that her father, like so many other Tarkington parents, lost an awful lot of money in the biggest swindle in the history of Wall Street, stock in a company called Microsecond Arbitrage.\nI HAD SPOTTED Kimberley as a snoop, all right, but not as a walking recording studio. All through the academic year now ending, our paths had crossed with puzzling frequency. Again and again I would be talking to somebody, almost anywhere on the campus, and realize that Kimberley was lurking close by. I assumed that she was slightly cracked, and was eavesdropping on everyone, avid for gossip. She wasn\u2019t even taking a course of mine for credit, although she did audit both Physics for Non-scientists and Music Appreciation for Nonmusicians. So what could I possibly be to her or she to me? We had never had a conversation about anything.\nOne time, I remember, I was shooting pool in the new recreation center, the Pahlavi Pavilion, and she was so close that I was having trouble working my cuestick, and I said to her, \u201cDo you like my perfume?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.\n\u201cI find you so close to me so often,\u201d I said, \u201cI thought maybe you liked my perfume. I\u2019m very flattered, if that\u2019s the case, because that\u2019s nothing but my natural body odor. I don\u2019t use perfume.\u201d\nI can quote myself exactly, since those words were on one of the tapes the Trustees would play back for me.", 0.04666756854256854], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["charley", 0.15992943520100483], ["earl", 0.14765863295675977], ["asia", 0.08914500111822939], ["maude", 0.08859517977405586], ["arrived", 0.07795268535952093], ["slotkin", 0.07795268535952093], ["thinking", 0.0590634531827039], ["chinese", 0.0584354441703136], ["opinions", 0.0584354441703136], ["lordy", 0.0584354441703136], ["oversimplification", 0.0584354441703136], ["suitcases", 0.0584354441703136], ["jawing", 0.0584354441703136], ["elbows", 0.0584354441703136], ["manila", 0.0584354441703136], ["bellboys", 0.0584354441703136], ["obediently", 0.0584354441703136], ["stay", 0.05798210875729839], ["rude", 0.05150397236471415], ["spoil", 0.05150397236471415], ["reddening", 0.05150397236471415], ["minds", 0.05150397236471415], ["presence", 0.0474493212836325], ["kick", 0.0474493212836325], ["staying", 0.0474493212836325], ["greater", 0.0474493212836325], ["checking", 0.0474493212836325], ["authority", 0.0474493212836325], ["practicing", 0.0474493212836325], ["flashbulbs", 0.0474493212836325], ["entitled", 0.0474493212836325], ["pleased", 0.04457250055911469], ["studying", 0.04457250055911469], ["dangerous", 0.04457250055911469], ["challenging", 0.0423410650459726], ["finding", 0.0423410650459726], ["apology", 0.0423410650459726], ["interrupted", 0.0423410650459726], ["cheeks", 0.040517849478033045], ["list", 0.040517849478033045], ["heck", 0.03897634267976047], ["master", 0.03897634267976047], ["interest", 0.03897634267976047], ["hotel", 0.03897634267976047], ["fired", 0.03764102875351524], ["fellow", 0.03764102875351524], ["asked", 0.036363854525924215], ["mirror", 0.03540959324037314], ["bedroom", 0.03540959324037314], ["subject", 0.03540959324037314], ["rubbed", 0.03540959324037314], ["surprise", 0.03540959324037314], ["wearing", 0.03540959324037314], ["block", 0.03540959324037314], ["clothes", 0.03540959324037314], ["simply", 0.034456491442329894], ["writer", 0.034456491442329894], ["surprised", 0.033586377672433596], ["phone", 0.033586377672433596], ["freeman", 0.033586377672433596], ["chance", 0.03278595059569823], ["changed", 0.03278595059569823], ["shot", 0.03204487087416101], ["deep", 0.03204487087416101], ["true", 0.03204487087416101], ["supper", 0.0313549421592915], ["top", 0.0313549421592915], ["week", 0.02953172659135195], ["set", 0.025854478790098778], ["front", 0.025854478790098778], ["felt", 0.02476248587044886], ["course", 0.024095572125462136], ["coming", 0.024095572125462136], ["days", 0.023778085142316333], ["night", 0.02205958257304974], ["wasn", 0.02129972350327052], ["work", 0.01951724118920733], ["door", 0.019315214116032136], ["face", 0.019315214116032136], ["eyes", 0.017164100319862683], ["day", 0.01684661333671688], ["people", 0.01389197120777852], ["good", 0.011801053229192926]], "sentiment": ["Slotkin fired his flashbulbs. \u201cOne more,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re not, Earl,\u201d said Charley. \u201cThat was rude of me.

They ate breakfast in the twilight of their cellar. The cart the old man had made late at night sat on the table. The boy ate with one hand, his other hand resting on the cart. Occasionally, he paused in eating to move the cart back and forth a few inches, and to imitate the sound of a motor.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice truck you\u2019ve got there, Mister,\u201d said the old man. \u201cBringing animals to the market, are you?\u201d\n\u201cBrummmaaaa, brummmaaaa.
