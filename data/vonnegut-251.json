She is in better spirits than I expected, although massively dependent on bottled oxygen. I saw none of the oxygen apparatus, which is formidable, I\u2019ve heard. It was all in her bedroom. Anyway, her head is in good condition, and she has about 300 pages of a novel which she wants to get back to. She has been doing little shit work for years, reviews and so on, since Liebling\u2019s first wife got all the income from Liebling\u2019s work. She is broke, puritanically disinclined to ask help from anybody, and talking about getting a second mortgage on her modest property\u2014in order to finish the book.\nNobody has an option on the book in progress. She has a sentimental attachment to Farrar, Straus & Giroux, a firm which in turn has no vivid interest in her, I gather. They must doubt that she can produce a book at this stage, and they are mistaken. You are the most brilliant speculator in literary futures in our time, and I give you this inside tip: She can produce at least one more important book.\nI think you should get in touch with Tim Seldes at once, and say you want the book, no matter what it is, and offer an advance that will keep her going for a year or so\u2014twenty thousand or so.\nYou should also know that she has all of Liebling\u2019s pieces in her files. The best of these should surely be collected in a Delta edition, since there is such a booming interest in journalism these days.\nAlso: One of the best books I have read this year is a scholarly essay, vastly humane and moving, though, on Christopher Columbus\u2014by Hans Koning, and published very recently by Monthly Review Press.

But when a man gets older he usually thinks moonlight is too thin and cool for comfort. Turley Whitman thought so. Turley was in his pajamas at his bedroom window, waiting for his daughter Nancy to come home.\nHe was a huge, kind, handsome man. He looked like a good king, but he was only a company cop in charge of the parking lot at the Reinbeck Abrasives Company. His club, his pistol, his cartridges, and his handcuffs were on a chair by the bed. Turley was confused and upset.\nHis wife, Milly, was in bed. For about the first time since their three-day honeymoon, in 1936, Milly hadn\u2019t put up her hair in curlers. Her hair was all spread out on her pillow. It made her look young and soft and mysterious. Nobody had looked mysterious in that bedroom for years. Milly opened her eyes wide and stared at the moon.\nHer attitude was what threw Turley as much as anything. Milly refused to worry about what was maybe happening to Nancy out in the moonlight somewhere so late at night. Milly would drop off to sleep without even knowing it, then wake up and stare at the moon for a while, and she would think big thoughts without telling Turley what they were, and then drop off to sleep again.\n\u201cYou awake?\u201d said Turley.\n\u201cHm?\u201d said Milly.\n\u201cYou decided to be awake?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m staying awake,\u201d said Milly dreamily. She sounded like a girl.\n\u201cYou think you\u2019ve been staying awake?\u201d said Turley.\n\u201cI must have dropped off without knowing it,\u201d she said.", 0.08647186147186148], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
