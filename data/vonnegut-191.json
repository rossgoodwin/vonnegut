You are now a Brigadier General in the National Guard!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019VE GOT A family on the other side of the lake,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go find out how they are.\u201d\nHe was able to tell me how they were. He personally, the day before, had seen Margaret and Mildred loaded into the steel box on the back of a prison van, consigned to the Laughing Academy in Batavia.\n\u201cThey\u2019re fine!\u201d he said. \u201cYour country needs you more than they do now, so, General Hartke, strut your stuff!\u201d\nHE WAS SO full of energy! It was almost as though his coal-scuttle helmet contained a thunderstorm.\nNever an idle moment! No sooner had he persuaded the Governor to make me a Brigadier than he was off to the stable, where captured Freedom Fighters were being forced to dig graves for all the bodies. The weary diggers had every reason to believe that they were digging their own graves. They had seen plenty of movies about the Finale Rack, in which soldiers in coal-scuttle helmets stood around while people in rags dug their own final resting places.\nI heard Harley III barking orders at the diggers, telling them to dig deeper and make the sides straighter and so on. I had seen leadership of such a high order exercised in Vietnam, and I myself had exhibited it from time to time, so I am quite certain that Harley III had taken some sort of amphetamine.\nTHERE WASN\u2019T MUCH for me to govern at first. This place, which had been the sole remaining business of any size in the valley, stood vacant and seemed likely to remain so. Most locals had managed to run away after the prison break. When they came back, though, there was no way to make a living. Those who owned houses or places of business couldn\u2019t find anybody to sell them to. They were wiped out.\nSo most of the civilians I might have governed had soon packed the best of their belongings into cars and trailers, and paid small fortunes to black marketeers for enough gasoline to get them the heck out of here.\nI HAD NO troops of my own. Those on my side of the lake were on loan from the commander of the National Guard Division, the 42nd Division, the \u201cRainbow Division,\u201d Lucas Florio. He had his headquarters in Hiroshi Matsumoto\u2019s old office at the prison. He wasn\u2019t a graduate of West Point, and he was too young to have fought in Vietnam, and his home was in Schenectady, so we had never met before. His troops were all White, with Orientals classified as Honorary White People. The same was true of the 82nd Airborne. There were also Black and Hispanic units somewhere, the theory being, as with the prisons, that people were always more comfortable with those of their own race.", 0.19764398326898322], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["fairchild", 0.16322604033408897], ["parachute", 0.14498692180908243], ["ghost", 0.12190634899111981], ["will", 0.1027519693982297], ["future", 0.08393965098171345], ["stood", 0.07122135409070528], ["ages", 0.06712697700237115], ["gift", 0.06712697700237115], ["raise", 0.06378162733642703], ["dark", 0.052659869472751517], ["owed", 0.04832897393636081], ["homes", 0.04832897393636081], ["restless", 0.04832897393636081], ["luxurious", 0.04832897393636081], ["goggles", 0.04832897393636081], ["argued", 0.04832897393636081], ["barnstormer", 0.04832897393636081], ["silk", 0.04832897393636081], ["sake", 0.04832897393636081], ["helmet", 0.04832897393636081], ["deadeyl", 0.04832897393636081], ["explanation", 0.04832897393636081], ["mule", 0.04832897393636081], ["dramatist", 0.04832897393636081], ["leather", 0.04832897393636081], ["scarf", 0.04832897393636081], ["generations", 0.04832897393636081], ["haunt", 0.041969825490856726], ["worn", 0.041969825490856726], ["shitboxes", 0.041969825490856726], ["roaming", 0.041969825490856726], ["inhabit", 0.041969825490856726], ["shakespeare", 0.041969825490856726], ["william", 0.041969825490856726], ["representative", 0.041969825490856726], ["heights", 0.0382499621137176], ["legend", 0.0382499621137176], ["lobby", 0.0382499621137176], ["vacant", 0.0382499621137176], ["raised", 0.03561067704535264], ["headwaiter", 0.03561067704535264], ["work", 0.034250656466076564], ["determined", 0.033563488501185575], ["today", 0.033563488501185575], ["remembered", 0.033563488501185575], ["invented", 0.033563488501185575], ["ended", 0.031890813668213516], ["bank", 0.031890813668213516], ["miracle", 0.031890813668213516], ["alive", 0.030476587247779952], ["ahead", 0.030476587247779952], ["serious", 0.030476587247779952], ["library", 0.02925152859984855], ["avondale", 0.028170950291074394], ["cemetery", 0.028170950291074394], ["empty", 0.028170950291074394], ["hippolyte", 0.028170950291074394], ["de", 0.028170950291074394], ["paul", 0.027204340055681495], ["live", 0.027204340055681495], ["wearing", 0.024797328455062308], ["lived", 0.02411743880227587], ["matter", 0.02348447667854237], ["city", 0.023037835602385717], ["arts", 0.022892380154344468], ["public", 0.022892380154344468], ["hotel", 0.022892380154344468], ["dick", 0.021811801845570307], ["told", 0.021229069631009484], ["white", 0.020845191610177408], ["center", 0.020845191610177408], ["black", 0.01997078629087167], ["midland", 0.018967920265432456], ["sort", 0.01843818000955822], ["waltz", 0.017436351642906918], ["wanted", 0.017436351642906918], ["rudy", 0.015452653400066222], ["town", 0.014486043164673322], ["lot", 0.01403842697963266], ["going", 0.010318563602493537], ["time", 0.009093504954562135], ["years", 0.008359168186915013], ["father", 0.005988418735982282]], "sentiment": ["The old headwaiter was determined to work his miracle, whether we wanted it or not.

The old barnstormer was wearing goggles and a white silk scarf and a black leather helmet and all, but no parachute.\nI remembered what Father had told me about him one time: \u201cWill Fairchild would be alive today, if only he had worn a parachute.\u201d\nSo there was Hippolyte Paul De Mule\u2019s gift to whoever was going to inhabit Midland City next: the restless ghost of Will Fairchild.\nAnd I, Rudy Waltz, the William Shakespeare of Midland City, the only serious dramatist ever to live and work there, will now make my own gift to the future, which is a legend.

It\u2019s just my advice. If you get an advance, I\u2019ll cheer with all my heart.\nAs for how advances work out financially: they are risks taken by publishers. If you get an advance of $1000, for example, you will get no more money until your book has earned $1000 in royalties for you. The publisher pays himself back out of your royalties. You haven\u2019t lost anything. He hasn\u2019t lost anything. It\u2019s a loan, see?\nIf your book doesn\u2019t earn $1000 in royalties for you, then that is tough shit for the publisher. You don\u2019t owe him anything. The same goes for an advance of a million dollars, which is what James Jones got a couple of years ago\u2014for three books.\nIf you get even a small advance on your book, the publisher will want to tie you up for several books, not just one. He will want to cross-collateralize those books, too. That is: if one book is a flop and another one is a best-seller, the best-seller will pay for the losses of the flop. You may not want to gamble that way. You may want all the gravy from the best-seller, and want the publisher to take the shellacking from the flop. You see?\nIn the house of my Father there are many options.\nThinking about money games now will simply fuck you up. Concentrate on creative games. That\u2019s your job. If your book makes a lot of money, which really good books usually don\u2019t, you will get that money as it is earned\u2014in straight royalties.\nAnd the really big whacks of money, of course, come from paperback sales. If you make a small fortune, it will come from paperbacks.\nSam Lawrence is eager to see your book. If you sign on with him, you will have committed yourself, as have I, to having your paperback done by Dell. So you will not get a spectacular advance for the paperback rights. But you will get spectacular checks over the years\u2014as royalties are earned.\nIf you got a spectacular advance, then your royalties would be used to pay it off. You see?
