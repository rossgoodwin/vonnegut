Between the two poles is a loop of wire, passing, like a clothesline, over pulleys fixed to the poles. Hanging from the wire are a series of metallic stars about two feet across. They are coated with fluorescent paint, so that a beam of invisible infrared light, playing on one star, then another, makes them come alive with dazzling color.\nThe old man, oblivious to the audience, contemplates the stars strung out before him, unhooks the star nearest to him, studies its surface, polishes a tarnished spot on it, shakes his head sadly, and lets the star fall. He looks down at the fallen star with regret, then at those still on the wire, then at the audience. He speaks.\nOLD MAN. I am the Sky Manager. It is I who keep night skies shining brightly; I who, when a star\u2019s glory is tarnished beyond restoration, must take it from the firmament. Every hundred years I climb my ladder to keep the heavens bright. And now my time has come again.\n(He pulls on the wire, bringing another star within reach. He removes the star and examines it.)\nAnd this is a strange star to be shining in the modern heavens. And yet, a hundred years ago, when I last kept my vigil, it was proud and new, and only a few meteors, destroying themselves in a brilliant instant, shone more brightly than this. (He holds up the star, and the infrared light makes it glow brightly, bringing out the lettering which says, \u201cLabor Unionism.\u201d He dusts it desultorily, shrugs, and lets it drop.) In brave company. (Looks down at scrap heap.) With stars named Rugged Individualism, Socialism, Free Enterprise, Communism, Fascism, and\u2014(Leaves sentence unfinished, and sighs.)\nIt is not an easy job, not always a pleasant one. But One far wiser than I, infinitely good, has decreed that it must be done (sighs), and be done dispassionately.\n(He pulls on wire, and brings in another star, the biggest of all. The infrared light hits it, and it lights up brilliantly, and on it is the image of the Oak, the symbol of the organization.)", 0.26019871332371336], "title": "Player Piano"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["glue", 0.2021941784688999], ["fill", 0.16431099610103406], ["murra", 0.15988150620818875], ["enclosure", 0.1137476489012607], ["bathtub", 0.11119220158561512], ["waiting", 0.10449716660489244], ["windows", 0.10449716660489244], ["drink", 0.10066179987695367], ["leak", 0.08914627577651985], ["duty", 0.08215549805051703], ["equipped", 0.08215549805051703], ["fleetwoods", 0.08215549805051703], ["trak", 0.08215549805051703], ["glasses", 0.08215549805051703], ["throwing", 0.07719546231858977], ["gasket", 0.07719546231858977], ["fleetwood", 0.07719546231858977], ["smart", 0.07334815970972408], ["upset", 0.07020468459258694], ["ice", 0.06754691425073765], ["trip", 0.06524464886065967], ["dirty", 0.06524464886065967], ["quick", 0.06524464886065967], ["dry", 0.06524464886065967], ["pardon", 0.0632139068665841], ["couple", 0.06139734625179399], ["kitchen", 0.06139734625179399], ["soul", 0.06139734625179399], ["storm", 0.05825387113465684], ["ceiling", 0.05825387113465684], ["bottle", 0.05825387113465684], ["hurt", 0.05559610079280756], ["standing", 0.053293835402729584], ["clear", 0.053293835402729584], ["hung", 0.05224858330244622], ["sense", 0.051263093408654], ["water", 0.04780325383172036], ["window", 0.04559923018499821], ["television", 0.04427231568265117], ["em", 0.04189041329505088], ["won", 0.04081247610571753], ["guess", 0.03624881137766439], ["god", 0.03624881137766439], ["wanted", 0.033648416727068114], ["house", 0.031089451121580652], ["men", 0.030219953645254923], ["asked", 0.0296637318828718], ["door", 0.02736146649279382], ["room", 0.026429273022616658]], "sentiment": ["\"Mr. Murra\u2014\" I said, \"I guess you\u2019re upset about something\u2014\"\n\"God you\u2019re smart!\" he said.\n\"Maybe throwing away that door makes sense,\" I said, \"but storm windows never hurt a soul.

I look at all those grades, some high, some low, and I think that I am like the compulsive gambler who borrowed so much money from me and who could not pay me back: I could not help myself.\nI have spoken elsewhere of the mentor I had at the University of Chicago, who was so brilliant, who could not find anyone to publish his most audacious work, and who committed suicide. I have not proved how brilliant he was. As I set out to do so now with an example, I am hesitant, not only because I have his reputation in my hands for a moment, but because all the good things he said which I remember were so simple and clear. It has been my experience with literary critics and academics in this country that clarity looks a lot like laziness and ignorance and childishness and cheapness to them. Any idea which can be grasped immediately is for them, by definition, something they knew all the time.\nSo it is with literary experimentation, too. If a literary experiment works like a dream, is easy to read and enjoy, the experimenter is a hack. The only way to get full credit as a fearless experimenter is to fail and fail.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA music critic once regaled a party I attended with a list of composers of serious music in the past. Nobody had heard of any of them, and the critic told us that they were all regarded in their own time as being the greatest composers alive. These were contemporaries of Beethoven and Brahms and Wagner and so on, composers for full orchestras in the Romantic mode.\nWe asked him why they weren\u2019t admired today. He had made it his business to hear as much of their work as he could, and he had this to say: \u201cIt was all gesture.\u201d By this he meant that musical promise after musical promise of great themes to come were made, and were not kept. The composers were honored in their own time for the gorgeousness of the promises they made but could not keep. They perhaps made promises which not even an archangel could keep.\nSome of the most imposing literary reputations of my own time, it seems to me, are based on just that sort of promising.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe example of my mentor\u2019s brilliance:\nUsing the Socratic method, he asked his little class this: \u201cWhat is it an artist does\u2014a painter, a writer, a sculptor\u2014?\u201d", 0.20272159090909087], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["rake", 0.12917832230556245], ["ben", 0.10166407973858183], ["bushel", 0.09688374172917183], ["handle", 0.07383112356024715], ["waded", 0.07383112356024715], ["tines", 0.07383112356024715], ["sand", 0.06458916115278122], ["bucket", 0.06458916115278122], ["day", 0.052852965480776615], ["clams", 0.05237195139445915], ["bag", 0.049940997303873094], ["beach", 0.049940997303873094], ["money", 0.048633658675046106], ["sea", 0.047885654906176314], ["week", 0.047885654906176314], ["dollars", 0.04340076874064125], ["began", 0.04069903489640715], ["knotted", 0.036915561780123576], ["treasure", 0.036915561780123576], ["wool", 0.036915561780123576], ["gloved", 0.036915561780123576], ["soured", 0.036915561780123576], ["telltale", 0.036915561780123576], ["witch", 0.036915561780123576], ["loan", 0.036915561780123576], ["swaddled", 0.036915561780123576], ["carped", 0.036915561780123576], ["niggled", 0.036915561780123576], ["spinster", 0.036915561780123576], ["tipped", 0.036915561780123576], ["fears", 0.036915561780123576], ["smoked", 0.036915561780123576], ["half", 0.03686327393038341], ["kilraine", 0.03686327393038341], ["hours", 0.03457193717136128], ["lost", 0.03388802657952728], ["hunt", 0.03229458057639061], ["tree", 0.03229458057639061], ["manly", 0.03229458057639061], ["whined", 0.03229458057639061], ["bay", 0.03229458057639061], ["click", 0.03229458057639061], ["burlap", 0.03229458057639061], ["apple", 0.03229458057639061], ["emptied", 0.03229458057639061], ["resting", 0.03229458057639061], ["bitterness", 0.03229458057639061], ["nagged", 0.03229458057639061], ["ached", 0.03229458057639061], ["rested", 0.03229458057639061], ["rent", 0.02959147985566951], ["satisfaction", 0.02959147985566951], ["buried", 0.02959147985566951], ["meals", 0.02959147985566951], ["milk", 0.02767359937265764], ["worried", 0.02767359937265764], ["round", 0.02767359937265764], ["sweetly", 0.02767359937265764], ["thick", 0.02767359937265764], ["grocery", 0.02767359937265764], ["prisoner", 0.02767359937265764], ["cigarettes", 0.02767359937265764], ["twisted", 0.026185975697229576], ["lifted", 0.026185975697229576], ["fifteen", 0.026185975697229576], ["hearing", 0.026185975697229576], ["cents", 0.026185975697229576], ["love", 0.025329974763895344], ["three", 0.024983634945185202], ["month", 0.024970498651936547], ["gathered", 0.024970498651936547], ["interest", 0.024970498651936547], ["numbers", 0.024970498651936547], ["bones", 0.024970498651936547], ["listening", 0.023942827453088157], ["voices", 0.023942827453088157], ["play", 0.023942827453088157], ["years", 0.02249582220411304], ["bank", 0.02226739793121545], ["water", 0.02226739793121545], ["forty", 0.021564994493496605], ["lived", 0.021564994493496605], ["time", 0.02097395794572794], ["dollar", 0.020349517448203576], ["honey", 0.020349517448203576], ["fat", 0.019815899397046668], ["laid", 0.019815899397046668], ["glad", 0.019815899397046668], ["fingers", 0.019321846249355186], ["soul", 0.019321846249355186], ["store", 0.019321846249355186], ["cottage", 0.019321846249355186], ["floor", 0.019321846249355186], ["fortune", 0.01886189377277551], ["hour", 0.01886189377277551], ["thinking", 0.018431636965191706], ["held", 0.017646416727482482], ["smile", 0.017646416727482482], ["school", 0.01694401328976364], ["beautiful", 0.01694401328976364], ["fine", 0.016618745528634092], ["days", 0.01601226700726258], ["feel", 0.01601226700726258], ["talking", 0.01601226700726258], ["full", 0.015456389614335575], ["high", 0.014943316006761385], ["called", 0.013406491616015835], ["mind", 0.012491817472592601], ["room", 0.012323032086030668], ["voice", 0.012323032086030668], ["big", 0.009086313314152664], ["good", 0.00813230768988151]], "sentiment": ["\u201cAnd love, as we all know,\u201d the Kilraine fortune called after him, \u201cmakes the world go \u2019round.\u201d\nBen laid the burlap bag on the beach before the Kilraine cottage, and waded into the sea with his bucket and rake. He buried the tines of the rake in the bay floor, and worried them through the sand.\nA telltale click ran through the handle of the rake to Ben\u2019s gloved fingers. Ben tipped the handle back, and lifted the rake from the water. Resting on the tines were three fat clams.\nBen was glad to stop thinking about love and money. Swaddled in the good feel of thick wool, listening only to the voices of the sea, he lost himself in the hunt for treasure under the sand.\nHe lost himself for an hour, and in that time he gathered almost half a bushel of clams.\nHe waded back to the beach, emptied his bucket into the bag, and rested and smoked.

Kurt tried to help his Russian translator, Rita Rait, by drawing weasels to replace his sketch of a beaver (the animal, not the mons veneris, which he also had drawn in the American edition).\nDear Don\u2014\nWell, I think the authorities really are fucking around with Rita\u2019s mail. I have learned from two sources other than you that Rita has heard nothing from me, and that she needs my approval for renaming Slaughterhouse-5 for the stage, and so on. I\u2019ve written her about three times during the past six weeks, doing all she says. And still she hears nothing. I will write again. Hi ho.\nI knew a little about the beaver\u2019s being changed to a weasel. I didn\u2019t know the linking of the animal with the mons veneris was to be eliminated. I drew her a weasel during our visit to Moscow. In fact, she made me draw about ten of them.\nIn my most recent letter to her, I enclosed David Hayman\u2019s report of a visit to Salinger which appeared in the Village Voice. I suppose the authorities junked that letter because of offensive materials on the back of the clipping.\nAbout The Brothers Karamazov: it was the first book I read after becoming a civilian after WWII. My new wife (nee Jane Cox, a Phi Beta Kappa from Swarthmore) made me read it on our honeymoon in Culver, Indiana. Culver is on Lake Maxinkuckee. The cottage in which we stayed had belonged to my family for three generations. It had just been sold. The new owner let us honeymoon there because he was a sentimentalist.
