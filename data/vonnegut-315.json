S. A.\n(1958)\nEPICAC\nHELL IT\u2019S ABOUT TIME somebody told about my friend EPICAC. After all, he cost the taxpayers $776,434,927.54. They have a right to know about him, picking up a check like that. EPICAC got a big send-off in the papers when Dr. Ormand von Kleigstadt designed him for the Government people. Since then, there hasn\u2019t been a peep about him\u2014not a peep. It isn\u2019t any military secret about what happened to EPICAC, although the Brass has been acting as though it were. The story is embarrassing, that\u2019s all. After all that money, EPICAC didn\u2019t work out the way he was supposed to.\nAnd that\u2019s another thing: I want to vindicate EPICAC. Maybe he didn\u2019t do what the Brass wanted him to, but that doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t noble and great and brilliant. He was all of those things. The best friend I ever had, God rest his soul.\nYou can call him a machine if you want to. He looked like a machine, but he was a whole lot less like a machine than plenty of people I could name. That\u2019s why he fizzled as far as the Brass was concerned.\nEPICAC covered about an acre on the fourth floor of the physics building at Wyandotte College. Ignoring his spiritual side for a minute, he was seven tons of electronic tubes, wires, and switches, housed in a bank of steel cabinets and plugged into a 110-volt A.C. line just like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner.\nVon Kleigstadt and the Brass wanted him to be a super computing machine that (who) could plot the course of a rocket from anywhere on earth to the second button from the bottom on Joe Stalin\u2019s overcoat, if necessary. Or, with his controls set right, he could figure out supply problems for an amphibious landing of a Marine division, right down to the last cigar and hand grenade. He did, in fact.\nThe Brass had had good luck with smaller computers, so they were strong for EPICAC when he was in the blueprint stage. Any ordinance or supply officer above field grade will tell you that the mathematics of modern war is far beyond the fumbling minds of mere human beings. The bigger the war, the bigger the computing machines needed. EPICAC was, as far as anyone in this country knows, the biggest computer in the world. Too big, in fact, for even Von Kleigstadt to understand much about.", 0.1355764991181658], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
