Vonnegut, Jr., Kurt\u2019s cousin and, like Kurt, a great-grandson of Clemens Vonnegut, who came to the United States in 1848.\nDEAR COLONEL & HELEN & KIT:\nGod bless you three. By now you must have set up temporary housekeeping in the cabin, and we are eager to hear of your progress to date and of your grandiose plans for the future. You have our love and our envy\u2014the two items, as nearly as we can tell, one person most wants from another. You three have taken exceptionally shrewd advantage of your constitutional right to pursue happiness.\nOur footsteps are in no wise so certain. The overall impression we gave when we last saw each other hasn\u2019t changed much: things are in one helluva state of flux. Last night we had our anniversary celebration at Jacques, a magnificent clip joint at 900 N. Michigan where one may live beyond his means under the stars in a flagstone courtyard. We toasted a merry future for you, for us, for George Seldes, Harry Truman, the Indonesian Republican Government, and the U.N. Atomic Control Commission. Through a mellow martini mist we tried to see what might be in store for us. Our vague prospectus is this: we may move to Indianapolis and take a job offered by public Bobbs Merrill; we may move to Schenectady and take a job offered by the public relations department of General Electric; we may move to Dayton, Ohio, and take a job offered by the Dayton Daily News. A representative from G.E. is going to interview me this evening: the Secretary-Treasurer of Bobbs Merrill is coming to Chicago to talk with me sometime during this next week. We\u2019ll let you know how these interviews turn out.\nAt the present time, I am working for the Chicago City News Bureau, a press association which gathers news in Cook County for all (yes, dammit, the Herald-American and Tribune too) of the Chicago papers. Victor Jose is going to work for the same organization next week. The News Bureau is part of a gruelling apprentice system: in order to land a job on any of the Chicago papers, one must begin as I have now begun. The job pays next to nothing. However, there are an immense number of applicants for jobs because the experience is highly respected and valuable. I am a police reporter. I covered a case last week wherein a woman of 54 (Mrs. Sosnowski) sawed her husband (Anthony) into two foot lengths, and carried his segmented mortal remains a distance of nine blocks and threw them into the river. She had to make several trips. \u201cHe died like a dog; now I\u2019ll die like a dog,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead, the dog.\u201d\nI have been admitted to candidacy for the master\u2019s degree. I\u2019ve had to cook up a new thesis topic: \u201cThe mythologies of North American Nativistic Movements.\u201d We have run out of money, so it may be some time before I can complete the thesis. It seems expedient that I make some sort of economic adjustment as soon as possible.\nIncidentally, three of my pictures were on view in Goodspeed Hall in the No Jury Student Art Exhibit there. No one bought any of them, though I thought my prices were extremely reasonable. Good taste has yet to come to the corn belt.\nAnd now, here is Jane:\nHello, dearhearts\u2014as we look dazedly (too many martinis last night) into the third year of marriage, which all of a sudden loometh ahead, we wish like everything that you were going to be around to share this gay life with us.\u2026 We miss you very much, dear friends.\u2026 It is a dismal feeling to start out on a walk of a Sunday afternoon knowing that we won\u2019t end up at 4310 Lake Park Ave.\u2026 I had better not dwell on this subject or I shall become maudlin.\u2026\nI was interrupted in the middle of a paragraph by the calling up and coming of this nice man from G.E. He was on a trip recruiting men for his public relations dept. and right now it looks very much as though K. will be one of his recruits. The job sounds very good, and as though it has a future, and certainly pays better than a newspaper would. Through it may be K. could get to be a Science Editor on a paper eventually, but without going through the long gruelling experience of reporting.\u2026 This is all still very much in the IF stage, since we still have to make contact with Bobbs-Merrill, and decide between them.\u2026 Not half as exciting as Pioneering, but anyhow, it is a form of progress.

He was good with languages. He was fluent in French and German and Spanish, too. He told the brothers that they should by all means sit down and eat, if they were as hungry as they appeared to be. He said that nobody should ever be hungry.\nHe was like a god to them. It was so easy for him to be like a god to them.\nAfter they had eaten, he took them up into the attic above the loft, the future gun room. There were two old cots up there. Light and air came from windows in a cupola at the peak of the roof. A ladder, its bottom bolted to the center of the attic floor, led up into the cupola. Father told the brothers that they could make the attic their home, until they found something better.\nHe said he had some old shoes and sweaters and so on, if they wanted them, in his trunks below.\nHe put them to work the next day, ripping out the stalls and tack room.\nAnd no matter how rich and powerful the Maritimo brothers subsequently became, and no matter how disreputable and poor

The bales had been stacked here before Haley\u2019s arrival at Ardennes Farm. Mr. Banghart pointed his flashlight at a bale in the bottom row. \u201cNotice anything different about that one?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a piece of cloth tied around the baling wire,\u201d said Haley.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a marker,\u201d said Mr. Banghart. \u201cTry and move that one.\u201d\nHaley tugged at the bale dutifully.

After snaking his way through nine feet of the snug, airless tunnel, with claustrophobia beginning to give him twinges of panic, he found himself in a chamber in which he could stand, lighted by Mr. Banghart\u2019s flashlight. It was a room hollowed in the stacked bales, as long and wide as the sunroom couch, with a ceiling, resting on planks, that barely brushed the top of his head.\nHope emerged from the passage as he stood blinking in disbelief. \u201cThis is one place where the General and Annie can never find you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be times when you\u2019ll be glad there is such a place.\u201d She sat down in a corner. \u201cIt was just a crazy thing to do to break the monotony, but it\u2019s a good job, if I do say so myself.

["Haley wondered if he should tell the General about Mr. Banghart\u2019s knife. Hope had made him promise not to say anything about it. She had laughed the matter off, and repeated what he had heard from others on the farm, that Mr. Banghart was no more dangerous than the mice in the corncrib. Still and all, he reflected, the combination of jangled brains and an eight-inch Bowie knife would be reassuring to very few persons. But the last thing he wanted to do was to go against Hope\u2019s judgment\u2026\n\u201cI told Banghart to quit at noon, and he got surly with me,\u201d said the General as an aside, apparently seeing that Haley\u2019s attention had wandered from the turning-point of World War II to the distant Mr. Banghart.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even stop for lunch,\u201d said Annie.\n\u201cToo bad it\u2019s just the nuts that work that hard,\u201d said the General. \u201cSeems like he does something like this every time the temperature gets above ninety. Remember the time he had the manure-spreader out until midnight? That was a hot day.\u201d The General snickered. \u201cBoy, the farm help you get these days. The darnedest thing happened this morning. I went over to the hog barn to watch Banghart feed the pigs. For no reason at all, he got sore as the devil when he saw me. He threw down the bucket, and can you imagine what he said?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. What did he say?\u201d said Annie. Haley noted with distaste that her conversations consisted mainly of questions of this sort, and of echoes.\n\u201cHe told me that I was going to cross him up once too often, and get mine along with the rest of them. Can you imagine?\u201d The General was laughing.\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019d better get rid of him,\u201d Haley blurted.\nThe General looked at him with surprise. \u201cI\u2019d sooner get rid of the tractor. He\u2019s nothing to worry about. I\u2019ve got him right under this.\u201d The General held up a broad, flat thumb and winked. \u201cWell, where was I? Oh, yes; \u2018Send me up some 240s,\u2019 I said, and\u2026\u201d\nHaley\u2019s thoughts strayed again, taking him back to the events of lunchtime, when Roy Flemming, Kitty\u2019s current love, had appeared in the kitchen, having walked into the house without knocking. Haley had never seen anything quite like Roy before. His red hair, his freckled moon-face and childish blue eyes were familiar enough, but his bearing and thin mustache seemed as out of keeping with these as an olive in the bottom of a milkshake. Haley wondered just what Roy imagined himself to represent. His swagger and attire \u2014 gleaming riding boots, enormously wide belt spangled with bits of colored glass; crushed and twisted Army officer\u2019s hat, and polo shirt decorated with palm trees \u2014 might be proper, Haley decided, for the leader of a bandit band in a musical comedy.\nThe General had spoken to Roy without looking up from his food. \u201cGet out,\u201d he had said. Kitty had told Roy to sit down, that her father was joking. The General had thereupon offered to fill his \u201csmart young behind with bird-shot\u201d if he showed up again.", -0.011772794389073448], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["cities", 0.13208991735326342], ["pillar", 0.11274786150145898], ["lord", 0.08805994490217561], ["salt", 0.08805994490217561], ["zo", 0.05637393075072949], ["overthrew", 0.05637393075072949], ["rained", 0.05637393075072949], ["disappear", 0.05637393075072949], ["brimstone", 0.05637393075072949], ["bustling", 0.05637393075072949], ["gideon", 0.05637393075072949], ["sodom", 0.05637393075072949], ["ar", 0.05637393075072949], ["failure", 0.05637393075072949], ["obsessed", 0.05637393075072949], ["vile", 0.05637393075072949], ["gomorrah", 0.05637393075072949], ["installment", 0.05637393075072949], ["streamers", 0.05637393075072949], ["titillated", 0.05637393075072949], ["waltzed", 0.048585760182640214], ["inhabitants", 0.048585760182640214], ["motel", 0.048585760182640214], ["amazing", 0.048585760182640214], ["screams", 0.048585760182640214], ["risen", 0.048585760182640214], ["homes", 0.048585760182640214], ["nicely", 0.048585760182640214], ["plain", 0.048585760182640214], ["ostrovsky", 0.048585760182640214], ["danced", 0.04402997245108781], ["freeze", 0.04402997245108781], ["festooned", 0.04402997245108781], ["grew", 0.04402997245108781], ["plan", 0.04402997245108781], ["tales", 0.04402997245108781], ["death", 0.04133092149363997], ["finished", 0.04079758961455094], ["decorated", 0.04079758961455094], ["truth", 0.04079758961455094], ["scene", 0.038290358700908134], ["entered", 0.038290358700908134], ["heaven", 0.038290358700908134], ["bible", 0.038290358700908134], ["lot", 0.036316459666354356], ["street", 0.03624180188299853], ["won", 0.03624180188299853], ["destruction", 0.0345097717725799], ["paper", 0.0345097717725799], ["reminded", 0.033009419046461666], ["fought", 0.033009419046461666], ["fun", 0.033009419046461666], ["move", 0.031686014151446125], ["write", 0.031686014151446125], ["wrote", 0.031686014151446125], ["love", 0.030502188132818863], ["crowd", 0.030502188132818863], ["written", 0.029431287236141055], ["people", 0.028934722026581542], ["better", 0.027554275048914466], ["sun", 0.027554275048914466], ["fire", 0.025946400401266452], ["ground", 0.025221248478372395], ["human", 0.024540072952345036], ["great", 0.02389784358335685], ["earth", 0.0232903467151515], ["wife", 0.02271401756472959], ["supposed", 0.022165813472938216], ["going", 0.021892776831019645], ["room", 0.02164311666805178], ["course", 0.021143658661637917], ["turned", 0.020665460746819984], ["read", 0.019766104480825195], ["long", 0.01893343063640135], ["book", 0.016109673015267577], ["looked", 0.015502176147062228], ["told", 0.011553885283715168], ["war", 0.007422146181183512], ["time", 0.007137676428551041]], "sentiment": ["The truth is death, he wrote.

The words are style and gallantry.\nWhen Rumfoord became the first person to own a private space ship, paying fifty-eight million dollars out of his own pocket for it\u2014that was style.\nWhen the governments of the earth suspended all space exploration because of the chrono-synclastic infundibula, and Rumfoord announced that he was going to Mars\u2014that was style.\nWhen Rumfoord announced that he was taking a perfectly tremendous dog along, as though a space ship were nothing more than a sophisticated sports car, as though a trip to Mars were little more than a spin down the Connecticut Turnpike\u2014that was style.\nWhen it was unknown what would happen if a space ship went into a chrono-synclastic infundibulum, and Rumfoord steered a course straight for the middle of one\u2014that was gallantry indeed.\nTo contrast Malachi Constant of Hollywood with Winston Niles Rumfoord of Newport and Eternity:\nEverything Rumfoord did he did with style, making all mankind look good.", 0.1630286858735135], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "if-this-isnt-nice-what-is": {"tfidf": [["alex", 0.0702063412900651], ["sweet", 0.04680422752671007], ["graduation", 0.0429234701125499], ["kid", 0.0429234701125499], ["uncle", 0.03975266042917677], ["books", 0.03707177904087663], ["brain", 0.03545684733831061], ["wallace", 0.03545684733831061], ["reluctance", 0.03545684733831061], ["ross", 0.03545684733831061], ["touching", 0.03545684733831061], ["interrupt", 0.03545684733831061], ["imbecile", 0.03545684733831061], ["brother", 0.03545684733831061], ["fingertips", 0.03545684733831061], ["happen", 0.03545684733831061], ["pep", 0.03545684733831061], ["internet", 0.03545684733831061], ["sensitive", 0.03545684733831061], ["lonesome", 0.03545684733831061], ["rarely", 0.03545684733831061], ["bennington", 0.03545684733831061], ["brains", 0.03545684733831061], ["ashamed", 0.03545684733831061], ["wore", 0.03545684733831061], ["objectionable", 0.03545684733831061], ["purse", 0.03545684733831061], ["agent", 0.03545684733831061], ["sad", 0.03545684733831061], ["ghosts", 0.03545684733831061], ["heft", 0.03545684733831061], ["turn", 0.03545684733831061], ["rules", 0.03545684733831061], ["steals", 0.03545684733831061], ["harley", 0.03545684733831061], ["sets", 0.03545684733831061], ["conversation", 0.02942948055083282], ["acknowledge", 0.02942948055083282], ["ended", 0.02942948055083282], ["mothers", 0.02942948055083282], ["rocks", 0.02942948055083282], ["cradle", 0.02942948055083282], ["apple", 0.02942948055083282], ["noticed", 0.02942948055083282], ["recommend", 0.02942948055083282], ["summertime", 0.02942948055083282], ["tree", 0.02942948055083282], ["compensation", 0.02942948055083282], ["deciding", 0.02942948055083282], ["william", 0.02942948055083282], ["vermont", 0.02942948055083282], ["hell", 0.029211168193171284], ["good", 0.02822100444395813], ["fall", 0.02590369700206617], ["devoted", 0.02590369700206617], ["drinking", 0.02590369700206617], ["lemonade", 0.02590369700206617], ["insurance", 0.02590369700206617], ["angels", 0.02590369700206617], ["wise", 0.02590369700206617], ["shade", 0.02590369700206617], ["friendly", 0.023402113763355034], ["large", 0.023402113763355034], ["computers", 0.023402113763355034], ["spoke", 0.023402113763355034], ["poet", 0.023402113763355034], ["buy", 0.023402113763355034], ["nickel", 0.023402113763355034], ["hand", 0.023402113763355034], ["vietnam", 0.023402113763355034], ["harvard", 0.02146173505627495], ["happy", 0.02146173505627495], ["things", 0.02064635975668791], ["hands", 0.019876330214588386], ["heaven", 0.019876330214588386], ["incidentally", 0.019876330214588386], ["times", 0.019876330214588386], ["join", 0.018535889520438314], ["bad", 0.018535889520438314], ["stuff", 0.018535889520438314], ["father", 0.018535889520438314], ["worth", 0.017374746975877247], ["extended", 0.017374746975877247], ["educated", 0.017374746975877247], ["tv", 0.016350546665821742], ["family", 0.016350546665821742], ["nice", 0.016350546665821742], ["read", 0.015434368268797164], ["feel", 0.015434368268797164], ["talk", 0.015434368268797164], ["graduates", 0.014605584096585642], ["women", 0.014605584096585642], ["beings", 0.013848963427110601], ["college", 0.013152939882123328], ["indianapolis", 0.013152939882123328], ["money", 0.01250852273296053], ["best", 0.011908584720030518], ["lot", 0.011908584720030518], ["find", 0.011347380188399462], ["going", 0.011347380188399462], ["war", 0.009853030128167644], ["vonnegut", 0.009407001481319378], ["human", 0.008578217309107856], ["will", 0.005881217932552731]], "sentiment": ["Some of you will become mothers.

murderous twentieth century catastrophes which had originated entirely in human brains. From the violence people were doing to themselves and each other, and to all other living things, for that matter, a visitor from another planet might have assumed that the environment had gone haywire, and that the people were in such a frenzy because Nature was about to kill them all.\nBut the planet a million years ago was as moist and nourishing as it is today\u2014and unique, in that respect, in the entire Milky Way. All that had changed was people\u2019s opinion of the place.\nTo the credit of humanity as it used to be: More and more people were saying that their brains were irresponsible, unreliable, hideously dangerous, wholly unrealistic\u2014were simply no damn good.\nIn the microcosm of the Hotel El Dorado, for example, the widow Mary Hepburn, who had been taking all her meals in her room, was cursing her own brain sotto voce for the advice it was giving her, which was to commit suicide.\n\u201cYou are my enemy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy would I want to carry such a terrible enemy inside of me?\u201d She had been a biology teacher in the public high school in Ilium, New York, now defunct, for a quarter of a century, and so was familiar with the very odd tale of the evolution of a then-extinct creature named by human beings the \u201cIrish elk.\u201d \u201cGiven a choice between a brain like you and the antlers of an Irish elk,\u201d she told her own central nervous system, \u201cI\u2019d take the antlers of the Irish elk.\u201d\nThese animals used to have antlers the size of ballroom chandeliers. They were fascinating examples, she used to tell her students, of how tolerant nature could be of clearly ridiculous mistakes in evolution. Irish elk survived for two and a half million years, in spite of the fact that their antlers were too unwieldy for fighting or self-defense, and kept them from seeking food in thick forests and heavy brush.\nMary had also taught that the human brain was the most admirable survival device yet produced by evolution. But now her own big brain was urging her to take the polyethylene garment bag from around a red evening dress in her closet there in Guayaquil, and to wrap it around her head, thus depriving her cells of oxygen.\nBefore that, her wonderful brain had entrusted a thief at the airport with a suitcase containing all her toilet articles and clothes which would have been suitable for the hotel. That had been her carry-on luggage on a flight from Quito to Guayaquil. At least she still had the contents of the suitcase she had checked through rather than carried, which included the evening dress in the closet, which was for parties on the Bah\u00eda de Darwin. She was also still in possession of a wet suit and flippers and mask for diving, two bathing suits, a pair of rugged hiking boots, and a set of war surplus United States Marine Corps combat fatigues for trips ashore, which she was wearing now. As for the pants suit she had worn on the flight from Quito: Her big brain had persuaded her to send it to the hotel laundry, to believe the sad-eyed hotel manager when he said she could surely have it back by morning, in time for breakfast. But, much to the embarrassment of the manager, that, too, had disappeared.\nBut the worst thing her brain had done to her, other than recommending suicide, was to insist that she come to Guayaquil despite all the news about the planetary financial crisis, despite the near certainty that \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century,\u201d booked to capacity only a month before, would be called off for want of passengers.", 0.07637237762237764], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["direction", 0.07821666243121268], ["honest", 0.07283942743211398], ["supper", 0.04942329717986411], ["facts", 0.04937573578259802], ["systems", 0.04937573578259802], ["gestures", 0.04937573578259802], ["anonymous", 0.04937573578259802], ["minerals", 0.04937573578259802], ["tartly", 0.04937573578259802], ["cholesterol", 0.04937573578259802], ["potable", 0.04937573578259802], ["bolts", 0.04937573578259802], ["delaware", 0.04937573578259802], ["3", 0.04937573578259802], ["pasty", 0.04937573578259802], ["houseroom", 0.04937573578259802], ["sipped", 0.04937573578259802], ["restaurant", 0.04937573578259802], ["clogged", 0.04937573578259802], ["tasting", 0.04937573578259802], ["screwing", 0.04937573578259802], ["manipulative", 0.04937573578259802], ["outrageous", 0.04937573578259802], ["household", 0.04937573578259802], ["warning", 0.04937573578259802], ["circulatory", 0.04937573578259802], ["instructed", 0.04937573578259802], ["guarantee", 0.04937573578259802], ["complexions", 0.04937573578259802], ["veal", 0.04937573578259802], ["wrench", 0.04937573578259802], ["overcooked", 0.04937573578259802], ["slazinger", 0.04333273206882113], ["crossing", 0.0428977247493275], ["washington", 0.0428977247493275], ["listless", 0.0428977247493275], ["promise", 0.0428977247493275], ["ordering", 0.0428977247493275], ["judging", 0.0428977247493275], ["customer", 0.0428977247493275], ["inn", 0.0428977247493275], ["upside", 0.0428977247493275], ["vitamins", 0.0428977247493275], ["wink", 0.0428977247493275], ["signals", 0.03910833121560634], ["declared", 0.03910833121560634], ["poison", 0.03910833121560634], ["fancy", 0.03910833121560634], ["george", 0.03910833121560634], ["bother", 0.03910833121560634], ["declaring", 0.03910833121560634], ["plan", 0.03910833121560634], ["meals", 0.03910833121560634], ["serving", 0.03641971371605699], ["paying", 0.03641971371605699], ["turning", 0.03641971371605699], ["chose", 0.03641971371605699], ["monkey", 0.03641971371605699], ["behaved", 0.03641971371605699], ["share", 0.03641971371605699], ["sat", 0.03641971371605699], ["plenty", 0.03641971371605699], ["happier", 0.03641971371605699], ["wine", 0.03641971371605699], ["pleased", 0.034334259965456894], ["switzerland", 0.034334259965456894], ["invited", 0.034334259965456894], ["collector", 0.032630320182335824], ["suppose", 0.032630320182335824], ["earlier", 0.032630320182335824], ["hate", 0.031189659623202567], ["send", 0.031189659623202567], ["accepted", 0.031189659623202567], ["offered", 0.031189659623202567], ["replied", 0.02994170268278647], ["missed", 0.02994170268278647], ["jackson", 0.026965499588220726], ["machine", 0.026965499588220726], ["dollars", 0.026152309149065307], ["earth", 0.024711648589932054], ["stay", 0.024066855398465217], ["face", 0.02289710639889507], ["turned", 0.022362915615344148], ["parents", 0.021378237898915863], ["pollock", 0.021378237898915863], ["beach", 0.020487488554950212], ["idea", 0.01967429811579479], ["times", 0.01967429811579479], ["wouldn", 0.018926235427257066], ["paul", 0.018573522081622985], ["sort", 0.018573522081622985], ["heard", 0.016148183806061447], ["died", 0.01588490458207363], ["picture", 0.015628839402745457], ["woman", 0.014900226865645346], ["wasn", 0.013196287082524275], ["pictures", 0.01262970183190339], ["kitchen", 0.01262970183190339], ["asked", 0.010804386389653241], ["house", 0.010654850489219214], ["going", 0.009804646954586254], ["people", 0.009406893548803114]], "sentiment": ["She accepted.

["There was a time when I might have been half-bombed on booze when writing such a letter so late at night, a time when I might have reeked of mustard gas and roses as I punched the keys. But I don\u2019t drink anymore. Never in my life have I written anything for publication while sozzled. But I certainly used to write a lot of letters that way.\nNo more.\nBe that as it may, I was sober then and am sober now, and Felix Kuznetzov and I had become friends during the previous summer\u2014at an ecumenical meeting in New York City, sponsored by the Charles F. Kettering Foundation, of American and Soviet literary persons, about ten to a side. The American delegation was headed by Norman Cousins, and included myself and Edward Albee and Arthur Miller and William Styron and John Updike. All of us had been published in the Soviet Union. I am almost entirely in print over there\u2014with the exception of Mother Night and Jailbird. Few, if any, of the Soviet delegates had had anything published here, and so their work was unknown to us.\nWe Americans were told by the Soviets that we should be embarrassed that their country published so much of our work, and that we published so little of theirs. Our reply was that we would work to get more of them published over here, but that we felt, too, that the USSR could easily have put together a delegation whose works were admired and published here\u2014and that we could easily have put together a delegation so unfamiliar to them that its members could have been sewer commissioners from Fresno, as far as anybody in the Soviet Union knew.\nFelix Kuznetzov and I got along very well, at any rate. I had him over to my house, and we sat in my garden out back and talked away the better part of an afternoon.\nBut then, after everybody went home, there was some trouble in the Soviet Union about the publication of an outlaw magazine called Metropole. Most of Metropole\u2019s writers and editors were young, impatient with the strictures placed on their writings by old poops. Nothing in Metropole, incidentally, was nearly as offensive as calling a chaplain\u2019s assistant a \u201cdumb motherfucker.\u201d But the Metropole people were denounced, and the magazine was suppressed, and ways were discussed for making life harder for anyone associated with it.\nSo Albee and Styron and Updike and I sent a cable to the Writers\u2019 Union, saying that we thought it was wrong to penalize writers for what they wrote, no matter what they wrote. Felix Kuznetzov made an official reply on behalf of the union, giving the sense of a large meeting in which distinguished writer after distinguished writer testified that those who wrote for Metropole weren\u2019t really writers, that they were pornographers and other sorts of disturbers of the peace, and so on. He asked that his reply be published in The New York Times, and it was published there. Why not?\nAnd I privately wrote to Kuznetzov as follows:\nDear Professor Kuznetzov\u2014dear Felix\u2014\nI thank you for your prompt and frank and thoughtful letter of August 20, and for the supplementary materials which accompanied it. I apologize for not replying in your own beautiful language, and I wish that we both might have employed from the first a more conversational tone in our discussion of the Metropole affair. I will try to recapture the amiable, brotherly mood of our long talk in my garden here about a year ago.", 0.10671624886741166], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["george",

anything. She was strapped up against a wall in the dark in the back of the van. George didn\u2019t worry much about her until we got within about an hour of where we were going. Then he got as fidgety as a beagle. Every ten minutes or so he\u2019d think Jenny had busted loose and was crashing around in her brains. We would have to pull over and stop, and go around in back and make sure she was fine.\nYou talk about plain living: the inside of the van looked like a monk\u2019s cell in a television station\u2019s control room. I\u2019d seen floorboards that were wider and springier than George\u2019s cot. Everything that was for George in the van was cheap and uncomfortable. I wondered at first where the quarter of a million dollars he\u2019d talked about was. But every time he passed his flashlight beam over Jenny\u2019s brains I got more excited. Those brains were the most ingenious, most complicated, most beautiful electronic system I\u2019ll ever see. Money was no object where Jenny was concerned.\nAs the sun came up we turned off the highway and banged over chuckholes into the hometown of the General Household Appliances Company. Here was the town where I\u2019d started my career, where he\u2019d started his career, where he\u2019d brought his bride so long ago.\nGeorge was driving. The banging woke me up, and it shook something loose in George. All of a sudden he had to talk. He went off like an alarm clock.\n\u201cDon\u2019t know her!\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t know her at all, Sonny Jim!\u201d He bit the back of his hand, trying to drown out the pain in his heart. \u201cI\u2019m coming to see a perfect stranger, Sonny Jim,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I know is she was very beautiful once. I loved her more than anything on earth once, and she broke everything I had into little pieces. Career, friendships, home\u2014kaput.\u201d George hit the horn button, blasted the bejeepers out of the dawn with the van\u2019s big bullhorn. \u201cDon\u2019t ever idolize a woman, Sonny Jim!\u201d he yelled.\nWe banged over another chuckhole. George had to grab the wheel with both hands. Steadying down the truck steadied him down, too. He didn\u2019t talk anymore till we got where we were going.\nWhere we were going was a white mansion with pillars across the front. It was Norbert Hoenikker\u2019s house. He was doing very well. He was assistant director of GHA research. He\u2019d been George\u2019s best friend years before\u2014before he\u2019d taken George\u2019s wife Nancy away from him.\nLights were on all over the house. We parked the van behind a doctor\u2019s car out front. We knew it was a doctor\u2019s car because it had a tag with those twined snakes on it up above the back license plate. The minute we parked, the front door of the house opened, and Norbert Hoenikker came out. He was wearing a bathrobe and slippers, and he hadn\u2019t slept all night.\nHe didn\u2019t shake hands with George. He didn\u2019t even say hello. He started right out with a rehearsed speech. \u201cGeorge,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay out here while you go in. I want you to consider it your house while you\u2019re in there\u2014with complete freedom for you and Nancy to say absolutely anything you have to say to each other.\u201d\nThe last thing George wanted to do was to go in there and face Nancy alone. \u201cI\u2014I haven\u2019t got anything to say to her,\u201d he said. He actually put his hand on the ignition key, got ready to start up the van and roar away.", 0.1700132911070411], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["twain", 0.17731375874996655], ["audience", 0.1004361678702355], ["nice", 0.07021424488711638], ["achieved", 0.06799108856485994], ["catastrophic", 0.06799108856485994], ["waited", 0.06799108856485994], ["orphanage", 0.06799108856485994], ["suspect", 0.06799108856485994], ["vanished", 0.06799108856485994], ["eternal", 0.06799108856485994], ["unity", 0.06799108856485994], ["harmoniousness", 0.06799108856485994], ["wholeness", 0.06799108856485994], ["artist", 0.06799108856485994], ["museums", 0.06799108856485994], ["artistic", 0.06799108856485994], ["automatically", 0.06799108856485994], ["burned", 0.06799108856485994], ["secret", 0.06489015861075115], ["times", 0.06048374176647783], ["creation", 0.05910458624998885], ["airplane", 0.05910458624998885], ["italy", 0.05910458624998885], ["technique", 0.05910458624998885], ["fade", 0.05910458624998885], ["horror", 0.05910458624998885], ["plane", 0.05910458624998885], ["inventor", 0.05910458624998885], ["protect", 0.05910458624998885], ["utmost", 0.05910458624998885], ["vacant", 0.05910458624998885], ["forgotten", 0.05910458624998885], ["number", 0.05390631563321751], ["presence", 0.05390631563321751], ["mark", 0.05390631563321751], ["seat", 0.05390631563321751], ["died", 0.053446899568996786], ["children", 0.0514735395398653], ["brother", 0.0514735395398653], ["filled", 0.05021808393511775], ["hadn", 0.05021808393511775], ["empty", 0.05021808393511775], ["grief", 0.05021808393511775], ["allow", 0.05021808393511775], ["entirely", 0.05021808393511775], ["issue", 0.04735726917467917], ["nature", 0.04735726917467917], ["opera", 0.04735726917467917], ["writing", 0.04501981331834642], ["minds", 0.04501981331834642], ["feel", 0.04304352255133028], ["uncle", 0.04304352255133028], ["alex", 0.04304352255133028], ["joke", 0.04304352255133028], ["morning", 0.041331581620246666], ["written", 0.041331581620246666], ["business", 0.039821542701575084], ["best", 0.038470766859808075], ["laughed", 0.03510712244355819], ["indianapolis", 0.03415702023645919], ["mind", 0.033272496243036735], ["began", 0.031667840564139224], ["person", 0.031667840564139224], ["york", 0.028362339162830257], ["sister", 0.02573676976993265], ["heard", 0.025270517921588097], ["years", 0.024385993928165647], ["told", 0.018905942456025393], ["time", 0.013894835934397038]], "sentiment": ["The museums in children\u2019s minds, I think, automatically empty themselves in times of utmost horror\u2014to protect the children from eternal grief.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFor my own part, though: It would have been catastrophic if I had forgotten my sister at once. I had never told her so, but she was the person I had always written for. She was the secret of whatever artistic unity I had ever achieved. She was the secret of my technique. Any creation which has any wholeness and harmoniousness, I suspect, was made by an artist or inventor with an audience of one in mind.\nYes, and she was nice enough, or Nature was nice enough, to allow me to feel her presence for a number of years after she died\u2014to let me go on writing for her.

If it did not disperse, its members would be guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for from ten years to life.\nNature sympathized again\u2014for a gentle snow began to fall.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYes, and an enclosed carriage drawn by two white horses clattered into the plaza at full speed and stopped by the gate. Into the dawn\u2019s early light stepped Colonel George Redfield, the governor\u2019s son-in-law, who had been commissioned by the governor, and who had come all the way from Sandusky to take command of the militiamen. He owned a lumber mill and was in the feed and ice businesses besides. He had no military experience, but was costumed as a cavalryman. He wore a saber, which was a gift from his father-in-law.\nHe went at once to the machine shop to address his troops.\nSoon after that wagons carrying riot police arrived. They were ordinary Cleveland policemen, but armed with wooden shields and blunt lances.\nAn American flag was flown from the top of the bell tower, and another from the pole by the main gate.\nIt was to be a pageant, young Alexander supposed. There would be no actual killing or wounding. All would be said by the way men posed. The strikers themselves had sent word that they would have their wives and children with them, and that not one of them would have a gun\u2014or even a knife with a blade more than three inches long.\n\u201cWe wish only,\u201d said their letter, \u201cto take one last look at the factory to which we gave the best years of our lives, and to show our faces to all who may care to look upon them, to show them to God Almighty alone, if only He will look, and to ask, as we stand mute and motionless, \u2018Does any American deserve misery and heartbreak such as we now know?\u2019\u201d\nAlexander was not insensitive to the beauty of the letter. It had, in fact, been written by the poet Henry Niles Whistler, then in the city to hearten the strikers\u2014a fellow Harvard man. It deserved a majestic reply, thought Alexander. He believed that the flags and the ranks of citizen soldiers and the solemn, steady presence of the police would surely do the job.", 0.1369585253456221], "title": "Jailbird"}, "petrified-ants": {"tfidf": [["random", 0.1403806123679688], ["delacorte", 0.13632190019657117], ["press", 0.13632190019657117], ["vonnegut", 0.08567668807697448], ["copyright", 0.0701903061839844], ["trademark", 0.0701903061839844], ["2009", 0.0701903061839844], ["kurt", 0.06425751605773086], ["house", 0.057616769913049974], ["reserved", 0.04544063339885706], ["colophon", 0.04544063339885706], ["1994", 0.04544063339885706], ["imprint", 0.04544063339885706], ["llc", 0.04544063339885706], ["origami", 0.04544063339885706], ["trust", 0.04544063339885706], ["united", 0.04544063339885706], ["eisbn", 0.04544063339885706], ["bantamdell", 0.04544063339885706], ["division", 0.04544063339885706], ["7", 0.04544063339885706], ["registered", 0.04544063339885706], ["440", 0.04544063339885706], ["978", 0.04544063339885706], ["forthcoming", 0.04544063339885706], ["news", 0.04544063339885706], ["33939", 0.04544063339885706], ["states", 0.04544063339885706], ["rights", 0.04544063339885706], ["appear", 0.0350951530919922], ["0", 0.0350951530919922], ["foreword", 0.0350951530919922], ["jr", 0.0350951530919922], ["express", 0.0350951530919922], ["published", 0.0350951530919922], ["story", 0.029043435060527062], ["group", 0.029043435060527062], ["publishing", 0.029043435060527062], ["york", 0.029043435060527062], ["offit", 0.029043435060527062], ["sidney", 0.029043435060527062], ["will", 0.029043435060527062], ["birdie", 0.029043435060527062], ["unpublished", 0.02474967278512735], ["petrified", 0.02474967278512735], ["short", 0.02474967278512735], ["fiction", 0.02141917201924362], ["good", 0.01264623672219707], ["ants", 0.007157807168087855]], "sentiment": ["Copyright \u00a9 2009 by The Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., Trust\nForeword \u00a9 2009 by Sidney Offit\nAll rights reserved.\nPublished in the United States by Delacorte Press, an imprint of The Random House Publishing Group, a division of Random House, Inc., New York.\nDELACORTE PRESS is a registered trademark of Random House, Inc., and the colophon is a trademark of Random House, Inc.\nThe story \u201cThe Petrified Ants\u201d will appear in Look at the Birdie: Unpublished Short Fiction by Kurt Vonnegut, forthcoming from Delacorte Press.\neISBN: 978-0-440-33939-7\nGood News, copyright \u00a9 1994 Kurt Vonnegut/Origami Express, LLC\nwww.vonnegut.com\nwww.bantamdell.com", -0.16623376623376626], "title": "Petrified Ants"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["nice", 0.24755400009197565], ["discover", 0.15864165948457506], ["doghouse", 0.15864165948457506], ["folly", 0.15864165948457506], ["build", 0.12955306482190349], ["understand", 0.12599223888574465], ["lady", 0.11089317069802669], ["autobiographical", 0.09032316594165174], ["blueprint", 0.09032316594165174], ["investigations", 0.09032316594165174], ["warn", 0.09032316594165174], ["device", 0.09032316594165174], ["parable", 0.09032316594165174], ["dane", 0.09032316594165174], ["observes", 0.09032316594165174], ["incomplete", 0.09032316594165174], ["episcopalian", 0.07932082974228753], ["rhode", 0.07932082974228753], ["pretending", 0.07932082974228753], ["puzzled", 0.07932082974228753], ["limits", 0.07932082974228753], ["newport", 0.07932082974228753], ["almighty", 0.07288487564533255], ["perfectly", 0.07288487564533255], ["design", 0.07288487564533255], ["proposed", 0.06831849354292334], ["claimed", 0.06831849354292334], ["3", 0.06831849354292334], ["bokonon", 0.06731873025276214], ["writes", 0.06477653241095174], ["nature", 0.06477653241095174], ["simply", 0.05377419621158753], ["ways", 0.05377419621158753], ["bound", 0.05377419621158753], ["god", 0.05285738932028289], ["working", 0.048433367058869865], ["karass", 0.04277186001222332], ["books", 0.0405534164824589], ["great", 0.0405534164824589], ["person", 0.0405534164824589], ["read", 0.03987786704723992], ["island", 0.03987786704723992], ["work", 0.038008295052694145], ["knew", 0.0353114849448307], ["things", 0.028875530847875704], ["going", 0.028227562680887528], ["people", 0.019804892029107044], ["asked", 0.01872222139376524]], "sentiment": ["Nice, nice, very nice;\nNice, nice, very nice\u2014\nSo many different people\nIn the same device.\n3\nFOLLY\nNOWHERE DOES BOKONON warn against a person\u2019s trying to discover the limits of his karass and the nature of the work God Almighty has had it do.

IGNORANCE\nI HAVE DISCOVERED from reading old newspapers and letters and diaries from back then that the men who built the machines for Elias Tarkington knew from the first that they would never work, whatever the reason. Yet what love they lavished on the materials that comprised them! How is this for a definition of high art: \u201cMaking the most of the raw materials of futility\u201d?\nSTILL ANOTHER PERPETUAL-MOTION machine envisioned by Elias Tarkington was what his Last Will and Testament called \u201cThe Mohiga Valley Free Institute.\u201d Upon his death, this new school would take possession of his 3,000-hectare estate above Scipio, plus half the shares in the wagon company, the carpet company, and the brewery. The other half was already owned by his sisters far away. On his deathbed he predicted that Scipio would 1 day be a great metropolis and that its wealth would transform his little college into a university to rival Harvard and Oxford and Heidelberg.\nIt was to offer a free college education to persons of either sex, and of any age or race or religion, living within 40 miles of Scipio. Those from farther away would pay a modest fee. In the beginning, it would have only 1 full-time employee, the President. The teachers would be recruited right here in Scipio. They would take a few hours off from work each week, to teach what they knew. The chief engineer at the wagon company, for example, whose name was Andr\u00e9 Lutz, was a native of Liege, Belgium, and had served as an apprentice to a bell founder there. He would teach Chemistry. His French wife would teach French and Watercolor Painting. The brewmaster at the brewery, Hermann Shultz, a native of Leipzig, would teach Botany and German and the flute. The Episcopalian priest, Dr. Alan Clewes, a graduate of Harvard, would teach Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and the Bible. The dying man\u2019s physician, Dalton Polk, would teach Biology and Shakespeare, and so on.\nAnd it came to pass.\nIn 1869 the new college enrolled its first class, 9 students in all, and all from right here in Scipio. Four were of ordinary college age. One was a Union veteran who had lost his legs at Shiloh. One was a former black slave 40 years old. One was a spinster 82 years old.\nTHE FIRST PRESIDENT was only 26 years old, a schoolteacher from Athena, 2 kilometers by water from Scipio. There was no prison over there back then, but only a slate quarry and a sawmill and a few subsistence farms. His name was John Peck. He was a cousin of the Tarkingtons\u2019. His branch of the family, however, was and remains unhampered by dyslexia. He has numerous descendants in the present day, 1 of whom, in fact, is a speech writer for the Vice-President of the United States.\nYoung John Peck and his wife and 2 children and his mother-in-law arrived at Scipio by rowboat, with Peck and his wife at the oars, their children seated in the stern, arid their luggage and the mother-in-law in another boat they towed behind.\nThey took up residence on the third floor of what had been Elias Tarkington\u2019s mansion. The rooms on the first 2 floors would be classrooms, a library, which was already a library with 280 volumes collected by the Tarkingtons, study halls, and a dining room. Many treasures from the past were taken up to the attic to make room for the new activities. Among these were the failed perpetual-motion machines. They would gather dust and cobwebs until 1978, when I found them up there, and realized what they were, and brought them down the stairs again.\nONE WEEK BEFORE the first class was held, which was in Latin, taught by the Episcopalian priest Alan Clewes, Andr\u00e9 Lutz the Belgian arrived at the mansion with 3 wagons carrying a very heavy cargo, a carillon consisting of 32 bells.

He is now forty-two, and about to get out. He asked me what he should do. I told him what Karl Marx would have told him: \u201cJoin a church.\u201d\nAnd now please note that I have raised my right hand. And that means that I\u2019m not kidding, that whatever I say next I believe to be true. So here goes: The most spiritually splendid American phenomenon of my lifetime wasn\u2019t our contribution to the defeat of the Nazis, in which I played such a large part, or Ronald Reagan\u2019s overthrow of Godless Communism, in Russia at least.\nThe most spiritually splendid American phenomenon of my lifetime is how African-American citizens have maintained their dignity and self-respect, despite their having been treated by white Americans, both in and out of government, and simply because of their skin color, as though they were contemptible and loathsome, and even diseased.\nTheir churches have surely helped them to do that. So there\u2019s Karl Marx again. There\u2019s Jesus again.\nAnd what gift of America to the rest of the world is actually most appreciated by the rest of the world? It is African-American jazz and its offshoots. What is my definition of jazz? \u201cSafe sex of the highest order.\u201d\nThe two greatest Americans of my lifetime, so far as I know, were Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Martin Luther King, Jr.\nI have heard it suggested that Roosevelt wouldn\u2019t have had such empathy for the lower classes, would have been just another rich, conceited, ruling-class Ivy League horse\u2019s ass, if he himself hadn\u2019t been humbled by poliomyelitis, infantile paralysis. All of a sudden his legs didn\u2019t work anymore.\nWhat can we do about global warming? We could turn out the lights, I guess, but please don\u2019t. I can\u2019t think of any way to repair the atmosphere. It\u2019s way too late. But there is one thing I can fix, and fix this very night, and right here in Indianapolis. It\u2019s the name of another good university you\u2019ve built since my time. But you\u2019ve named it \u201cI.U.P.U.I.\u201d \u201cI.U.P.U.I.\u201d?
