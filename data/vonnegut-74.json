Lawrence bought the rights to all Kurt\u2019s previous books, first published Welcome to the Monkey House in 1968, and the next year brought out Slaughterhouse-Five, which became a worldwide bestseller.\nHad Slaughterhouse-Five been written and published in the 1950s, it would not have made the same impact. The timing of the novel\u2019s publication was eerily right, for by 1969 many Americans had become critical of the war in Vietnam, not only because the Tet Offensive of 1968 illustrated how badly we were faring in the conflict but also because of the revelation of atrocities like the My Lai Massacre, the use of napalm against civilian populations, and the saturation bombing of Cambodia and Laos that began in March of 1969\u2014the same month Slaughterhouse-Five was published. A novel based on the firebombing of Dresden during WWII would not have seemed as relevant in the preceding decade as it did now; it would not have struck such a nerve.\nThe events in Vietnam and the protests against the draft, led by college students, increased the growing influence of the youth culture, who made Vonnegut their literary hero in questioning the accepted wisdom of the status quo. Kurt was as surprised as anyone and had never wanted to be a \u201cspokesman\u201d of the young. He was very leery of the hippie phenomenon and wrote a searing account of one of their heroes, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, guru to the Beatles and assorted movie stars (\u201cYes, We Have No Nirvanas,\u201d published in Esquire and collected in his book Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons). He satirized the stylish popularity of Eastern meditation, saying we had the same thing in the West\u2014reading short stories, which also lowered your heart rate and freed your mind from other concerns.

The hundred had been driven into the trees by tanks.\nDerby described the incredible artificial weather that Earthlings sometimes create for other Earthlings when they don\u2019t want those other Earth-lings to inhabit Earth any more. Shells were bursting in the treetops with terrific bangs, he said, showering down knives and needles and razorblades. Little lumps of lead in copper jackets were crisscrossing the woods under the shellbursts, zipping along much faster than sound.\nA lot of people were being wounded or killed. So it goes.\nThen the shelling stopped, and a hidden German with a loudspeaker told the Americans to put their weapons down and come out of the woods with their hands on the top of their heads, or the shelling would start again. It wouldn\u2019t stop until everybody in there was dead.\nSo the Americans put their weapons down, and they came out of the woods with their hands on top of their heads, because they wanted to go on living, if they possibly could.\nBilly traveled in time back to the veterans\u2019 hospital again.

She was wearing tri-focal lenses in harlequin frames, and the frames were trimmed with rhinestones. The glitter of the rhinestones was answered by the glitter of the diamond in her engagement ring. The diamond was insured for eighteen hundred dollars. Billy had found that diamond in Germany. It was booty of war.\nBilly didn\u2019t want to marry ugly Valencia.

you do to make sure that it stays dead forever?\u201d Her answer was this: \u201cYou must bury it at a crossroads, of course, with a little stake driven through its heart.\u201d\nWhat was so thought provoking about all sorts of Gal\u00e1pagos finches to young Charles Darwin, though, was that they were behaving as best they could like a wide variety of much more specialized birds on the continents. He was still prepared to believe, if it turned out to make sense, that God Almighty had created all the creatures just as Darwin found them on his trip around the world. But his big brain had to wonder why the Creator in the case of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands would have given every conceivable job for a small land bird to an often ill-adapted finch? What would have prevented the Creator, if he thought the islands should have a woodpecker-type bird, from creating a real woodpecker? If he thought a vampire was a good idea, why didn\u2019t he give the job to a vampire bat instead of a finch, for heaven\u2019s sakes? A vampire finch?\nAnd Mary used to state the same intellectual problem to her students, concluding: \u201cYour comments, please.\u201d\nWhen she went ashore for the first time on the black peak where the Bah\u00eda de Darwin had been run aground, Mary stumbled. She broke her fall in such a way as to abrade the knuckles on her right hand. It wasn\u2019t a painful event. She made the most cursory examination of her injuries. There were these scratches from which beads of blood arose.\nBut then a finch, utterly fearless, lit on her finger. She was unsurprised, since she had heard many stories of finches landing on people\u2019s heads and hands and drinking cups or whatever. So she resolved to enjoy this welcome to the islands, and held her hand still, and spoke sweetly to the bird. \u201cAnd which of the thirteen sorts of finch are you?\u201d she said.\nAs though it understood her question, the bird now showed her what sort it was by sipping up the red beads on her knuckles.\nSo she took another look around at the island, never imagining that she was going to spend the rest of her life there, providing thousands of meals for vampire finches. She said to the Captain, for whom she had lost all respect, \u201cYou say this is R\u00e1bida Island?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure of it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I hate to tell you this after all you\u2019ve been through, but you\u2019re wrong again,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has to be Santa Rosalia.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d he said.", 0.15271825396825398], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["wallpaper", 0.11955975543056796], ["literature", 0.09975555027171239], ["fizzing", 0.07547433898197126], ["protecting", 0.07547433898197126], ["rolls", 0.07547433898197126], ["okinawa", 0.07547433898197126], ["whistle", 0.07547433898197126], ["freeloader", 0.07547433898197126], ["comrades", 0.07547433898197126], ["penny", 0.06557223640254348], ["direct", 0.06557223640254348], ["bless", 0.06557223640254348], ["witch", 0.06557223640254348], ["spit", 0.06557223640254348], ["action", 0.06557223640254348], ["situation", 0.06557223640254348], ["begged", 0.05977987771528398], ["freeze", 0.05977987771528398], ["gathered", 0.05977987771528398], ["fuck", 0.05977987771528398], ["silver", 0.05977987771528398], ["exclaimed", 0.05977987771528398], ["friendship", 0.05977987771528398], ["called", 0.05678191036381884], ["physical", 0.05567013382311568], ["filled", 0.05567013382311568], ["enemy", 0.05567013382311568], ["younger", 0.05567013382311568], ["grenade", 0.052482368804341255], ["god", 0.051927652169664634], ["sounds", 0.049877775135856194], ["japanese", 0.04767562256689536], ["enemies", 0.04767562256689536], ["missed", 0.0457680312436879], ["star", 0.0457680312436879], ["lying", 0.0457680312436879], ["deep", 0.0440854164485967], ["suddenly", 0.0440854164485967], ["crazy", 0.0440854164485967], ["kill", 0.04258026622491346], ["understand", 0.03777351998746757], ["hell", 0.03678790753765398], ["thought", 0.03645344410015764], ["won", 0.035865928664260104], ["madison", 0.034999862638311036], ["polly", 0.034999862638311036], ["ten", 0.03418331386916891], ["feel", 0.03418331386916891], ["hand", 0.03341092499387926], ["told", 0.03212344701080905], ["incidentally", 0.031981161300208075], ["talk", 0.03131658964828104], ["death", 0.030681564468697697], ["better", 0.02893010272452152], ["wouldn", 0.02893010272452152], ["wanted", 0.02893010272452152], ["find", 0.026417378917897746], ["american", 0.025524230961021546], ["slazinger", 0.022079058720780288], ["kitchen", 0.019305401371623752], ["life", 0.017969314828611988], ["asked", 0.016515276338469956], ["man", 0.015407301562100318], ["years", 0.013235641457834239]], "sentiment": ["\u201cDidn\u2019t you know how it would make me feel?\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t have missed it for anything,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand this,\u201d I said. \u201cSuddenly it sounds as though you\u2019re all my enemies.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about these two,\u201d said Slazinger, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure as hell your enemy.

somebody loses something and gets it back; somebody is wronged and gets revenge; Cinderella; somebody hits the skids and just goes down, down, down; people fall in love with each other, and a lot of other people get in the way; a virtuous person is falsely accused of sin; a sinful person is believed to be virtuous; a person faces a challenge bravely, and succeeds or fails; a person lies, a person steals, a person kills, a person commits fornication.\nINTERVIEWER: If you will pardon my saying so, these are very old-fashioned plots.\nVONNEGUT: I guarantee you that no modern story scheme, even plotlessness, will give a reader genuine satisfaction, unless one of those old fashioned plots is smuggled in somewhere. I don\u2019t praise plots as accurate representations of life, but as ways to keep readers reading. When I used to teach creative writing, I would tell the students to make their characters want something right away\u2014even if it\u2019s only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaningless of modern life still have to drink water from time to time. One of my students wrote a story about a nun who got a piece of dental floss stuck between her lower left molars, and who couldn\u2019t get it out all day long. I thought that was wonderful. The story dealt with issues a lot more important than dental floss, but what kept readers going was anxiety about when the dental floss would finally be removed. Nobody could read that story without fishing around in his mouth with a finger. Now, there\u2019s an admirable practical joke for you. When you exclude plot, when you exclude anyone\u2019s wanting anything, you exclude the reader, which is a mean-spirited thing to do. You can also exclude the reader by not telling him immediately where the story is taking place, and who the people are\u2014\nINTERVIEWER: And what they want.\nVONNEGUT: Yes. And you can put him to sleep by never having characters confront each other. Students like to say that they stage no confrontations because people avoid confrontations in modern life. \u201cModern life is so lonely,\u201d they say. This is laziness. It\u2019s the writer\u2019s job to stage confrontations, so the characters will say surprising and revealing things, and educate and entertain us all. If a writer can\u2019t or won\u2019t do that, he should withdraw from the trade.\nINTERVIEWER: Trade?\nVONNEGUT: Trade. Carpenters build houses. Storytellers use a reader\u2019s leisure time in such a way that the reader will not feel that his time has been wasted. Mechanics fix automobiles.\nINTERVIEWER: Surely talent is required?\nVONNEGUT: In all those fields. I was a Saab dealer on Cape Cod for a while, and I enrolled in their mechanic\u2019s school, and they threw me out of their mechanic\u2019s school.

And there\u2019s an enchanting thought for lonely men\u2014a pool of girls, teeming, warm, and deep.\nAmy Lou Little was a pretty, confident, twenty-year-old girl from Birmingham, Alabama. When my wife-to-be graduated from secretarial school in Birmingham, the school said she was fast and accurate, and a recruiter from the Montezuma Forge and Foundry Company, way up north, offered her a very good salary if she would come to Pittsburgh.\nWhen my wife-to-be got to Pittsburgh, they put her in the Montezuma Forge and Foundry Company\u2019s girl pool, with earphones and a Dictaphone and an electric typewriter. They put her at a desk next to Miss Nancy Hostetter, leader of section C of the girl pool, who had been in the girl pool for twenty-two years. Miss Hostetter was a great elk of a woman, righteous, healthy and strong, and inconceivably fast and accurate. She said Amy was to look upon her as a big sister.\nI was in the Montezuma Forge and Foundry Company, too, a rootless pleaser of unseen customers. The customers wrote to the company, and twenty-five of us replied, genially, competently. I never saw the customers, and the customers never saw me, and no one suggested that we exchange snapshots.\nAll day long, I talked into a Dictaphone, and messengers carried off the records to the girl pool, which I\u2019d never seen.\nThere were sixty girls in the girl pool, ten to a section. Bulletin boards in every office said the girls belonged to anyone with access to a Dictaphone, and almost any man would have found a girl to his taste among the sixty. There were maidens like my wife-to-be, worldly women made up like showgirls, moon-faced matrons, and erect and self-sufficient spinsters, like Miss Hostetter.\nThe walls of the girl pool were eye-rest green, and had paintings of restful farm scenes on them, and the air was a rhapsody of girls\u2019 perfumes and the recorded music of Andr\u00e9 Kostelanetz and Mantovani. From morning until night, the voices of Montezuma\u2019s men, transcribed on Dictaphone records, filled the girls\u2019 ears.\nBut the men sent only their voices, never their faces, and they talked only of business. And all they ever called a girl was \u201coperator.\u201d", 0.24890804597701155], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["betty", 0.09983424312499933], ["felt", 0.0839481170465637], ["bobby", 0.0839481170465637], ["brown", 0.07617292589921826], ["marked", 0.07166628254133886], ["tastes", 0.07166628254133886], ["listless", 0.07166628254133886], ["disturbing", 0.07166628254133886], ["maple", 0.07166628254133886], ["psychologist", 0.07166628254133886], ["wood", 0.07166628254133886], ["grave", 0.07166628254133886], ["syrup", 0.07166628254133886], ["insecure", 0.07166628254133886], ["decreed", 0.07166628254133886], ["skull", 0.07166628254133886], ["filling", 0.07166628254133886], ["martian", 0.07166628254133886], ["engraved", 0.07166628254133886], ["examinations", 0.06229942874998825], ["bravely", 0.06229942874998825], ["specialist", 0.06229942874998825], ["parted", 0.06229942874998825], ["permanently", 0.06229942874998825], ["reunited", 0.06229942874998825], ["distance", 0.06229942874998825], ["turning", 0.05682017053231035], ["increased", 0.05682017053231035], ["early", 0.05682017053231035], ["game", 0.05682017053231035], ["separation", 0.05682017053231035], ["buried", 0.05682017053231035], ["frightened", 0.05293257495863764], ["required", 0.05293257495863764], ["avalanche", 0.05293257495863764], ["stupid", 0.05293257495863764], ["rooms", 0.04991712156249967], ["forever", 0.04991712156249967], ["pretended", 0.04991712156249967], ["apart", 0.04991712156249967], ["amused", 0.04991712156249967], ["fun", 0.04991712156249967], ["separated", 0.04745331674095974], ["simple", 0.04745331674095974], ["stone", 0.04745331674095974], ["cordelia", 0.043565721167287026], ["eliza", 0.04224412600054245], ["cordiner", 0.03926229236838791], ["learned", 0.03926229236838791], ["wished", 0.03808646294960913], ["names", 0.03808646294960913], ["speak", 0.03507100955347116], ["sort", 0.03260720473193123], ["head", 0.03187656660665724], ["mansion", 0.030524087436968283], ["called", 0.0298954385770373], ["read", 0.029294739082836842], ["died", 0.02816796058366047], ["thing", 0.02816796058366047], ["children", 0.027127946514253334], ["death", 0.02526105004829635], ["parents", 0.02526105004829635], ["good", 0.02401276193841776], ["will", 0.02181656018844783], ["dr", 0.020224897544442653], ["swain", 0.019927885291486227], ["time", 0.01464590814706715]], "sentiment": ["Our parents were in another part of the mansion.

steering wheel was drunk and having close shaves with oncoming trucks and sideswiping parked cars and so on. He said that the President of the United States ought to be given a wheel like that at his inauguration, to remind him and everybody else that all he could do was pretend to steer.\nHe let me off at the airport.\nThe planes to New York City were all overbooked, it turned out. I did not get out of Atlanta until five o\u2019clock that afternoon. That was all right with me. I skipped lunch, having no appetite. I found a paperback book in a toilet stall, so I read that for a while. It was about a man who, through ruthlessness, became the head of a big international conglomerate. Women were crazy about him. He treated them like dirt, but they just came back for more. His son was a drug addict and his daughter was a nymphomaniac.\nMy reading was interrupted once by a Frenchman who spoke to me in French and pointed to my left lapel. I thought at first that I had set myself on fire again, even though I didn\u2019t smoke anymore. Then I realized that I was still wearing the narrow red ribbon that identified me as a chevalier in the French L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur. Pathetically enough, I had worn it all through my trial, and all the way to prison, too.\nI told him in English that it had come with the suit, which I had bought secondhand, and that I had no idea what it was supposed to represent.\nHe became very icy, \u201cPermettez-moi, monsieur,\u201d he said, and he deftly plucked the ribbon from my lapel as though it had been an insect there.\n\u201cMerci,\u201d I said, and I returned to my book.\nWhen there was at last an airplane seat for me, my name was broadcast over the public-address system several times: \u201cMr. Walter F. Starbuck, Mr. Walter F. Starbuck \u2026\u201dIt had been such a notorious name at one time; but I could not now catch sight of anyone who seemed to recognize it, who raised his or her eyebrows in lewd surmise.\nTwo and a half hours later I was on the island of Manhattan, wearing my trenchcoat to keep out the evening chill.

friend here, spoke as badly of his own country as Slazinger and I did, and right into the faces of students in the classroom day after day. I used to sit in on his course and laugh and clap. The truth can be very funny in an awful way, especially as it relates to greed and hypocrisy. Kimberley must have made recordings of his words, too, and played them back for her father. Why wasn\u2019t Damon fired right along with me?\nMy guess is that he was a comedian, and I was not. He wanted students to leave his presence feeling good, not bad, so the atrocities and stupidities he described were in the distant past. There was nothing a student could do about them but laugh, laugh, laugh.\nWhereas Slazinger and I talked about the last half of the 20th Century, in which we had both been seriously wounded physically and psychologically, which was nothing anybody but a sociopath could laugh about.\nI, TOO, MIGHT have been acceptable as a comedian if all Kimberley had taped was what I said about Yen and fellatio. That was good, topical Mohiga Valley humor, what with the Japanese taking over the prison across the lake and arousing curiosity among the natives about the relative values of different national currencies. The Japanese were willing to pay their local bills in either dollars or Yen. These bills were for small-ticket items, hardware or toiletries or whatever, which the prison needed in a hurry, usually ordered by telephone. Big-ticket items in quantity came from Japanese-owned suppliers in Rochester or beyond.\nSo Japanese currency had started to circulate in Scipio. The prison administrators and guards were rarely seen in town, however. They lived in barracks to the east of the prison, and lived lives as invisible to this side of the lake as those of the prisoners.\nTO THE LIMITED extent that anybody on this side of the lake thought about the prison at all until the mass escape, people were generally glad to have the Japanese in charge. The new proprietor had cut waste and corruption to almost nothing. What they charged the State for punishing its prisoners was only 75 percent of what the State used to pay itself for identical services.\nThe local paper, The Valley Sentinel, sent a reporter over there to see what the Japanese were doing differently. They were still using the steel boxes on the back of trucks and showing old TV shows, including news, in no particular order and around the clock. The biggest change was that Athena was drug-free for the first time in its history, and rich prisoners weren\u2019t able to buy privileges. The guards weren\u2019t easily fooled or corrupted, either, since they understood so little English, and wanted nothing more than to finish up their 6 months overseas and go home again.\nA NORMAL TOUR of duty in Vietnam was twice that long and 1,000 times more dangerous. Who could blame the educated classes with political connections for staying home?\nONE NEW WRINKLE by the Japanese the reporter didn\u2019t mention was that the guards wore surgical masks and rubber gloves when they were on duty, even up in the towers and atop the walls. That wasn\u2019t to keep them from spreading infections, of course. It was to ensure that they didn\u2019t take any of their loathsome charges\u2019 loathsome diseases back home with them.\nWHEN I WENT to work over there, I refused to wear gloves and a mask. Who could teach anybody anything while wearing such a costume?", 0.07789417613636365], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["helmholtz", 0.11011110058813027], ["chair", 0.0857734834040248], ["drum", 0.08028642339324389], ["band", 0.07734680024013603], ["empty", 0.07149646744500275], ["chamberlain", 0.06202525657991177], ["sublime", 0.06202525657991177], ["telegram", 0.05826470661322183], ["reply", 0.05826470661322183], ["rehearsal", 0.055347797445715816], ["baton", 0.05094946755524244], ["bandsmen", 0.05094946755524244], ["plummer", 0.046287049987415875], ["gentleman", 0.04390376166331189], ["bricks", 0.03819310076491085], ["requesting", 0.03819310076491085], ["collect", 0.03819310076491085], ["duller", 0.03819310076491085], ["unexpectedly", 0.03819310076491085], ["strung", 0.03819310076491085], ["messenger", 0.03819310076491085], ["retrieved", 0.03819310076491085], ["springy", 0.03819310076491085], ["inspiration", 0.03819310076491085], ["envelope", 0.03819310076491085], ["buzzers", 0.03819310076491085], ["dies", 0.03819310076491085], ["camel", 0.033662727035760884], ["tore", 0.033662727035760884], ["contemplating", 0.033662727035760884], ["shaking", 0.033662727035760884], ["offering", 0.033662727035760884], ["sensed", 0.033662727035760884], ["sounding", 0.033662727035760884], ["fill", 0.033662727035760884], ["marking", 0.033662727035760884], ["badly", 0.033662727035760884], ["untalented", 0.033662727035760884], ["racket", 0.031012628289955886], ["fantastic", 0.031012628289955886], ["kandahar", 0.031012628289955886], ["sessions", 0.031012628289955886], ["folding", 0.031012628289955886], ["knights", 0.031012628289955886], ["bounded", 0.031012628289955886], ["session", 0.029132353306610913], ["hall", 0.029132353306610913], ["hurried", 0.029132353306610913], ["sensitive", 0.029132353306610913], ["wheels", 0.029132353306610913], ["period", 0.029132353306610913], ["union", 0.029132353306610913], ["western", 0.029132353306610913], ["brick", 0.029132353306610913], ["double", 0.029132353306610913], ["student", 0.029132353306610913], ["halfway", 0.027673898722857908], ["luck", 0.027673898722857908], ["stuffed", 0.027673898722857908], ["symbol", 0.027673898722857908], ["edge", 0.027673898722857908], ["disappeared", 0.026482254560805916], ["organization", 0.026482254560805916], ["rear", 0.02547473377762122], ["doors", 0.02547473377762122], ["pain", 0.02547473377762122], ["director", 0.02547473377762122], ["practice", 0.024601979577460943], ["clarinet", 0.023143524993707938], ["sold", 0.023143524993707938], ["threw", 0.023143524993707938], ["handed", 0.023143524993707938], ["realized", 0.023143524993707938], ["lord", 0.021951880831655946], ["large", 0.021951880831655946], ["expect", 0.021951880831655946], ["phone", 0.021951880831655946], ["account", 0.021951880831655946], ["stick", 0.021951880831655946], ["closed", 0.021428725879541328], ["march", 0.02094436004847125], ["deal", 0.02094436004847125], ["touch", 0.02049342624790294], ["bit", 0.02049342624790294], ["caught", 0.02049342624790294], ["class", 0.02049342624790294], ["cried", 0.01930178208585095], ["minute", 0.01930178208585095], ["waiting", 0.01930178208585095], ["wall", 0.01930178208585095], ["fell", 0.01930178208585095], ["stopped", 0.018948401554672676], ["minutes", 0.018948401554672676], ["moved", 0.018948401554672676], ["middle", 0.018948401554672676], ["stay", 0.018948401554672676], ["fifty", 0.018294261302666252], ["read", 0.018294261302666252], ["moment", 0.01799020891289571], ["second", 0.01769967451700791], ["point", 0.017421507102505975], ["open", 0.017154696680804958], ["wait", 0.01641398631932128], ["dollars", 0.015748739951282443], ["matter", 0.015748739951282443], ["office", 0.015144992760883649], ["white", 0.014955531735568274], ["knew", 0.014955531735568274], ["find", 0.014248253404586363], ["high", 0.013921387910634325], ["ten", 0.013763887573516284], ["called", 0.013459835183745744], ["great", 0.012891133373356005], ["told", 0.012494894015078655], ["wanted", 0.012494894015078655], ["call", 0.012367978421241389], ["lot", 0.012001380599992739], ["hear", 0.011654257558725102], ["room", 0.011010858390011032], ["life", 0.010519202042052943], ["looked", 0.009471210865090987], ["good", 0.00771310668574701], ["man", 0.006230034567383046]], "sentiment": ["\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d he cried in pain. He threw his white baton against the brick wall. The springy stick bounded off the bricks and fell into an empty folding chair at the rear of the clarinet section\u2014Plummer\u2019s empty chair.\nAs Mr. Helmholtz retrieved the baton, he found himself unexpectedly moved by the symbol of the empty chair. No one else, he realized, no matter how untalented, could fill the last chair in the organization as well as Plummer had. Mr. Helmholtz looked up to find many of the bandsmen contemplating the chair with him, as though they, too, sensed that something great, in a fantastic way, had disappeared, and that life would be a good bit duller on account of that.\nDuring the ten minutes between the C Band and B Band sessions, Mr. Helmholtz hurried to his office and again tried to get in touch with the Sublime Chamberlain of the Knights of Kandahar. No luck! \u201cLord knows where he\u2019s off to now,\u201d Mr. Helmholtz was told. \u201cHe was in for just a second, but went right out again. I gave him your name, so I expect he\u2019ll call you when he gets a minute.

Mr. Helmholtz wanted to stay by the phone until he\u2019d caught the Sublime Chamberlain and closed the deal, but the B Band was waiting\u2014and after that it would be the A Band.\nAn inspiration came to him. He called Western Union and sent a telegram to the man, offering fifty dollars for the drum and requesting a reply collect.\nBut no reply came during B Band practice. Nor had one come by the halfway point of the A Band session. The bandsmen, a sensitive, high-strung lot, knew immediately that their director was on edge about something, and the rehearsal went badly. Mr. Helmholtz stopped a march in the middle because somebody outside was shaking the large double doors at one end of the rehearsal room.\n\u201cAll right, all right, let\u2019s wait until the racket dies down so we can hear ourselves,\u201d Mr. Helmholtz said.\nAt that moment, a student messenger handed him a telegram.

It\u2019s fast and useful and unornamental. It\u2019s as up-to-date as a rocket ship. I never saw anything that was less like a pyramid than this truck.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA pyramid was a sort of huge stone tomb which Egyptians had built thousands and thousands of years before. The Egyptians didn\u2019t build them anymore. The tombs looked like this, and tourists would come from far away to gaze at them:\n\u201cWhy would anybody in the business of highspeed transportation name his business and his trucks after buildings which haven\u2019t moved an eighth of an inch since Christ was born?\u201d\nThe driver\u2019s answer was prompt. It was peevish, too, as though he thought Trout was stupid to have to ask a question like that. \u201cHe liked the sound of it,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you like the sound of it?\u201d\nTrout nodded in order to keep things friendly. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a very nice sound.\u201d", 0.2391666666666667], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["hush", 0.2612023489610477], ["flash", 0.1959017617207858], ["blinding", 0.1959017617207858], ["elmer", 0.12620540740371605], ["story", 0.11381854297026596], ["scared", 0.09411974392473728], ["trap", 0.09172844607807823], ["ivy", 0.0890050432562249], ["pay", 0.08344960950083821], ["afraid", 0.07277947507693915], ["life", 0.07045226841757743], ["hats", 0.06530058724026193], ["tugged", 0.06530058724026193], ["wrecking", 0.06530058724026193], ["sleeve", 0.06530058724026193], ["loud", 0.06530058724026193], ["father", 0.06310250717890449], ["robert", 0.057638313368950686], ["horrible", 0.057638313368950686], ["wreckers", 0.05618022960131528], ["wreck", 0.05618022960131528], ["passionately", 0.05618022960131528], ["nails", 0.05618022960131528], ["gripped", 0.05618022960131528], ["sigh", 0.05618022960131528], ["builders", 0.05618022960131528], ["closing", 0.05618022960131528], ["ethelbert", 0.053115938186670174], ["crying", 0.050845162389365754], ["hear", 0.049257952023726084], ["impatiently", 0.04705987196236864], ["price", 0.044123772602971144], ["heads", 0.041724804750419106], ["rolled", 0.03969650633163939], ["edge", 0.03969650633163939], ["shouted", 0.037939514323421984], ["cried", 0.03374933365080969], ["listen", 0.03260444711147246], ["table", 0.031551253589452245], ["won", 0.028819156684475343], ["door", 0.027269379899522925], ["going", 0.02420508848487782], ["better", 0.021455791053746096], ["will", 0.020994063161492542], ["thought", 0.019293908799913512], ["boy", 0.019293908799913512], ["people", 0.018519691694348597], ["eyes", 0.018519691694348597]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI am different,\u201d said Elmer. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid anymore.\u201d He gripped the edge of the table and shouted. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid!\u201d\n\u201cHush!\u201d said Ivy. \u201cThey\u2019ll hear you!\u201d\n\u201cI will not hush!\u201d said Elmer passionately.\n\u201cYou better hush,\u201d said Ivy. \u201cYou know what Robert the Horrible does to people who won\u2019t hush.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Elmer, \u201che nails their hats to their heads.
