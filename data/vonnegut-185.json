Because his deity wanted to give the wealth of the United States to the people of the United States. Where was his deity? In Morristown, New Jersey. Was she pleased with how he was doing his job? She was neither pleased nor displeased, since she was as dead as a doornail. What should he do next?

Still\u2014RAMJAC was enormous when compared with other conglomerates. The second largest conglomerate in the Free World was only half its size. The next five after that, if combined, would have been only about two-thirds the size of RAMJAC.\nThere are plenty of dollars, it turns out, to buy all the goodies the federal government has to sell.

This was what caused the murders.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAfter the Keedslers lost the mansion at the start of the Great Depression, Fred T. Barry and his parents moved in. The old place was filled with the sounds of British birds. It was silent property of the city now, and there was talk of making it into a museum where children could learn the history of Midland City\u2014as told by arrowheads and stuffed animals and white men\u2019s early artifacts.\nFred T. Barry had offered to donate half a million dollars to the proposed museum, on one condition: that the first Robo-Magic and the early posters which advertised it be put on display.\nAnd he wanted the exhibit to show, too, how machines evolved just as animals did, but with much greater speed.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI gazed at the Keedsler mansion, never dreaming that a volcanic dog was about to erupt behind me. Kilgore Trout came nearer. I was almost indifferent to his approach, although we had momentous things to say to one another about my having created him.\nI thought instead of my paternal grandfather, who had been the first licensed architect in Indiana. He had designed some dream houses for Hoosier millionaires. They were mortuaries and guitar schools and cellar holes and parking lots now. I thought of my mother, who drove me around Indianapolis one time during the Great Depression, to impress me with how rich and powerful my maternal grandfather had been. She showed me where his brewery had been, where some of his dream houses had been. Every one of the monuments was a cellar hole.\nKilgore Trout was only half a block from his Creator now, and slowing down. I worried him.\nI turned toward him, so that my sinus cavities, where all telepathic messages were sent and received, were lined up symmetrically with his.

Gypsies had stolen them, and Jesus and the crowd had to wait until the soldiers sent for new nails. After that, God Almighty gave permission to all Gypsies to steal all they could.\u201d She pointed to the bloated Gypsy queen. \u201cShe believed that story. All Gypsies do.\u201d\n\u201cToo bad for her that she believed it,\u201d I said. \u201cOr maybe it didn\u2019t matter whether she believed it or not, since she was starving to death when she arrived all alone in Happy Valley.\n\u201cShe tried to steal a chicken from the farmhouse,\u201d I said. \u201cThe farmer saw her from this bedroom window, and took a shot at her with a small-caliber rifle he kept under his feather mattress. She ran away. He thought he had missed her, but he hadn\u2019t. She had a little bullet in her abdomen, and she lay down there and died. Three days later, the rest of us came along.\u201d\n\u201cIf she\u2019s a queen of the Gypsies, where are her subjects?\u201d Circe asked again.\nI explained that she had been queen of only about forty people at the peak of her power, including babes in arms. While there were notorious disputes in Europe as to which races and subraces were vermin, all Europeans could agree that the thieving, fortune-telling, childstealing Gypsies were the enemies of all decent humankind. So they were hunted down everywhere. The queen and her people gave up their caravans, and their traditional costumes, too\u2014gave up everything which might identify them as Gypsies. They hid in forests in the daytime, and foraged for food at night.\nOne night, when the queen went out alone to look for food, one of her subjects, a fourteen-year-old boy, was caught stealing a ham from a Slovak mortar squad which had deserted the German lines on the Russian front. They were headed home, which wasn\u2019t far from Happy Valley. They made the boy lead them to the Gypsy camp, where they killed everybody. So when the queen came back, she didn\u2019t have any subjects.\nSuch was the story I made up for Circe Berman.\nCirce provided the missing link in the narrative. \u201cSo she wandered into Happy Valley, looking for other Gypsies,\u201d she said.", 0.060600799663299676], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["jealous", 0.17950065830073206], ["mistress", 0.17950065830073206], ["deserve", 0.144061552214664], ["career", 0.144061552214664], ["larry", 0.14155466505035974], ["ellen", 0.10801528534584626], ["told", 0.10285345121100462], ["accommodate", 0.08975032915036603], ["pressing", 0.08975032915036603], ["nary", 0.08975032915036603], ["metropolitan", 0.08975032915036603], ["commercials", 0.08975032915036603], ["easier", 0.08975032915036603], ["meatier", 0.08975032915036603], ["roster", 0.08975032915036603], ["remark", 0.08975032915036603], ["opera", 0.08975032915036603], ["huskily", 0.07857053591552819], ["mixing", 0.07857053591552819], ["grimly", 0.07857053591552819], ["detach", 0.07857053591552819], ["starter", 0.07857053591552819], ["return", 0.072030776107332], ["singing", 0.072030776107332], ["drinks", 0.072030776107332], ["beatrix", 0.072030776107332], ["habits", 0.072030776107332], ["edith", 0.072030776107332], ["janice", 0.072030776107332], ["couldn", 0.0708782121721361], ["threw", 0.06739074268069037], ["petrified", 0.06739074268069037], ["age", 0.06739074268069037], ["entered", 0.06379165314336441], ["cry", 0.060850982872494165], ["closer", 0.060850982872494165], ["busy", 0.060850982872494165], ["meant", 0.05431122306429797], ["foolish", 0.05431122306429797], ["tears", 0.05261185990852658], ["company", 0.04503115621101471], ["won", 0.04313142982946014], ["will", 0.04064512854192371], ["feel", 0.03849139640281851], ["work", 0.03385136297617688], ["hands", 0.03150971765610434], ["life", 0.029465335307085887], ["wife", 0.026333786687070444], ["good", 0.019275363787994704], ["man", 0.015312901459377968]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHe\u2019s an awfully busy man, Ellen.\u201d\n\u201cHe said his career was a jealous mistress,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cWhat does that make me?\u201d\nIt did seem to me that Larry\u2019s remark was a little meatier than necessary. \u201cWell, Ellen, I think you\u2019re well off.

ruled, evidently, by a small clique of power brokers who believed that most Americans were so boring and ungifted and small time that they could be slain by the tens of thousands without inspiring any long-term regrets on the part of anyone. \u201cThey have now proved this with Midland City,\u201d said the leaflet, \u201cand who is to say that Terre Haute or Schenectady will not be next?\u201d\nThat was certainly the most inflammatory of their beliefs\u2014that Midland City had been neutron-bombed on purpose, and not from a truck, but from a missile site or a high-flying airplane. They had hired a mathematician from, they said, \u201ca great university,\u201d to make calculations independent of the Government\u2019s, as to where the flash had originated. The mathematician could not be named, they said, for fear that retaliatory action would be taken against him, but it was his opinion, based largely on the pattern of livestock deaths on the outer perimeter of the flash, that the center of the flash was near Exit 11 on the Interstate, all right, but at least sixty feet above the pavement. That certainly suggested a package which had arrived by air.\nEither that, or a truck had been hauling a neutron bomb in an enormous pop-up toaster.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBernard Ketchum asked the farmer who had given us our leaflets to name the clique which had supposedly neutron-bombed Midland City. This was the answer he got: \u201cThey don\u2019t want us to know their name, so they don\u2019t have a name. You can\u2019t fight back against something that don\u2019t have a name.\u201d\n\u201cThe military-industrial complex?\u201d said Ketchum archly. \u201cThe Rockefellers? The international conglomerates? The CIA? The Mafia?\u201d\nAnd the farmer said to him, \u201cYou like any of them names? Just help yourself. Maybe that\u2019s who it is, maybe it ain\u2019t. How\u2019s a farmer supposed to find out? It\u2019s whoever it was shot President Kennedy and his brother\u2014and Martin Luther King.\u201d\nSo there we had it\u2014the ever-growing ball of American paranoia, the ball of string a hundred miles in diameter, with the unsolved assassination of John F.
