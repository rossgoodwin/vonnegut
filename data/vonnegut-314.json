The telegram said he had died on a secret mission, and we couldn\u2019t have any details. We had our Congressman, Earl Waterman, find out what he could about Bud. Mr. Waterman came and talked to us personally, and he looked like he had seen God. He said he couldn\u2019t tell us what Bud had done, but it was one of the most heroic things in United States history.\nThe word they put out on the big rocket we saw launched was that the firing was satisfactory, the knowledge gained was something wonderful, and the missile had been blown up over the ocean somewhere. That was that.\nThen the word came that the man in the Russian baby moon was dead. I tell you honestly, Mr. Ivankov, that was good news to us, because that man sailing way up there with all those instruments meant just one thing, and that was a terrible weapon of war.\nThen we heard the Russian baby moon had turned into a bunch of baby moons, all spreading apart. Then, this last month, the cat was out of the bag. Two of the baby moons were men. One was your boy, the other was mine.\nI\u2019m crying now, Mr. Ivankov. I hope some good comes of the death of our two boys. I guess that\u2019s what millions of fathers have hoped for as long as there have been people. There in the U.N. they\u2019re still arguing about what happened way up in the sky. I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve got around to where everybody, including your Mr. Koshevoi, agrees it was an accident. Bud was up there to get pictures of what your boy was riding in, and to show off for the United States some. He got too close. I like to think they lived a little while after the crash, and tried to save each other.\nThey say they\u2019ll be up there for hundreds of years, long after you and I are gone. In their orbits they will meet and part and meet again, and the astronomers know exactly where their next meeting place will be. Like you say, they are up there like the sun and the moon and the stars.\nI enclose a photograph of my boy in his uniform. He was twenty-one when the picture was taken. He was only twenty-two when he died. Bud was picked for that mission on account of he was the finest flyer in the United States Air Force. That\u2019s what he always wanted to be. That\u2019s what he was.\nI grasp your hand.\nCharles M. Ashland\nPetroleum Merchant", 0.09278846153846156], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
