and short stories for The New Yorker. He worked for the magazine from 1927 until his death in 1958.\nDear Young Man\u2014\nI thank you for the existence of the encyclopedia of me, a work of love. You must already know that I like you a lot.\nYou might have a look at Bellow\u2019s Augie March, which was somehow of spiritual use to me when my situation was superficially similar to yours. It may read like a piece of junk now. Businesses and institutions were commonly like families then, paternalism\u2019s or maternalism\u2019s being a widespread technique of management. I used to think that was a swindle, making relatives of employees in order to keep wages low. So when we went looking for work, we were shopping for a family. When I got a job with General Electric, that was really something, because nothing could hurt GE in the next 100 years at least, seemingly, and my job was for life. The same seemed true about the luggage store on Main Street, and the stationery store next door to it. \u201cGood! Then you\u2019ll come to work tomorrow! We open at eight, so you should be here no later than seven-thirty.\u201d\nThe excellent writer Wolcott Gibbs when a young man was interviewed by Harold Ross, founder of the New Yorker. The interview went very well. Gibbs got a job. But as he was leaving, and Ross believed him to be out of earshot, Ross cried out, \u201cGod damn it, I\u2019d hire anybody!\u201d Until very recently, jobs at the New Yorker were also for life, but the pay was low. The pay is very high now, but goes to jittery, hand-to-mouth independent contractors, in effect. Like actors, they are in for lifetimes of seeking work, hat in hand.\nNew technologies are doing this to everybody, and for that reason I am a Luddite. Video stores and TV cable systems are already obsolescent. My wife is a superb portraitist in black and white photography, which reveals so much about the topography of human faces. But everybody wants color now. In all of New York City, she can\u2019t find a lab to print meticulously black and white for her. As we used to say back when I was part of the GE family, and my wife and kids were included: \u201cProgress is our most important product.\u201d\nThe mood of my generation? Wry disappointment with what the world has actually become, so inhospitable and snide. Once the Great Depression and the Second World War were over, we planned to build a Garden of Eden here. But you\u2019ll be OK. It\u2019s other people, surely including my own kids, I worry a lot about.", 0.1374614898989899], "title": "Letters"}}
