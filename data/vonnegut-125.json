Price Fox and his wife.\nEvarts Ziegler was a highly respected Hollywood agent whom Knox introduced to Kurt.\nPaul Horgan was a novelist and historian who won two Pulitzer Prizes for his history books on the American Southwest, where he had attended the New Mexico Military Institute. He had won a Guggenheim Fellowship and taught at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he became a professor of English.\nHarry Mark Petrakis was a Greek American writer of short stories and novels and an autobiography, A Dream of Kings, which became a New York Times bestseller.\nDear Knox:\nI\u2019m terribly excited. I think we\u2019re going to win our first Big Ten game in three years tomorrow. The Hawks against the Hoosiers.\nI was out on the Coast a week ago, had topless pizza with Bill and Sarah after drinks with Ziegler. Ziegler sure has class. I liked him a lot. We have entered into a shapeless sort of business relationship. He will keep me in mind, but he won\u2019t think about me so often that Max will be offended. He told me that the way to write for the movies was to create a strong central character that a famous actor would demand to play. So I came home and wrote Kirk Douglas into my war book: But then I crossed him out again, because the war I saw wasn\u2019t really that way. I am stuck with the fine arts, I guess. Maybe I\u2019ll get the Nobel Peace Prize, which is 60 G\u2019s. Donald Kaul, a very good columnist for the Des Moines Register, suggested the other day that maybe the standard for the Peace Prize should be lowered, since nobody could be found to meet the present standards. He said maybe it should be awarded to somebody who was a really lousy shot.\nThat would be very nice if you would mention me favorably to Horgan and any other academic writers with power in the East. I think I have something very good going with the Rhode Island School of Design, but won\u2019t know for sure until December. I hear hints out here that I\u2019ll be offered an associate professorship and a big raise, but that isn\u2019t sure, either. The academic year coming up looks like a big one\u2014third down, six yards to go, ball on the opponents\u2019 forty-five. Amazingly, I\u2019ll have four kids in college next year\u2014and one in the Peace Corps and one in junior high. I feel like a charwoman in an old Adolphe Menjou movie.\nThe Guggenheim Foundation wrote, saying that I had been mentioned to them as a guy who might make a good Guggenheimer. So I applied. Since I am now in my forty-fifth year, this is the last year in which I am eligible.\nHarry Mark Petrakis used my Cape Cod house last week, was invaded by Dartmouth football players after the Harvard game. My boy Steve, by the way, the sophomore offensive end, has played in every game so far. He is slow, but tall and good at dancing. He made the All-Cape basketball team\u2014and football team, and baseball team. He and Dartmouth were made for each other.", 0.14974846504258266], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["knox", 0.11615430355614809], ["uncle", 0.04327647428554746], ["ngers",

We were mourning not only Lincoln, but the death of American eloquence.\nAnother look-alike there was Rosemary Smith, Mask and Wig\u2019s costume mistress, and mother of Frank Smith, its superstar. She resembled Ida Young, grandchild of slaves, who worked for us in Indianapolis when I was little. Ida Young, in combination with my uncle Alex, had as much to do with my upbringing as my parents did.\nNobody was a near double for Uncle Alex. He did not like my writing. I dedicated The Sirens of Titan to him, and Uncle Alex said, \u201cI suppose the young people will like it.\u201d Nobody resembled my aunt Ella Vonnegut Stewart, a first cousin of my father\u2019s, either. She and her husband, Kerfuit, owned a bookstore in Louisville, Kentucky. They did not stock my books because they found my language obscene. So it was back then, when I was starting out.\nAmong other departed souls whom I would not summon back to life, if I had had the power to do so, but who were represented by doppelg\u00e4ngers: nine of my teachers at Shortridge High School, and Phoebe Hurty, who hired me in high school to write ad copy about teenage clothing for Blocks\u2019 Department Store, and my first wife Jane, and my mother, and my uncle John Rauch, husband to another of Father\u2019s first cousins. Uncle John provided me with a history of my family in America, which I printed in Palm Sunday.\nJane\u2019s unknowing stand-in, a pert young woman who teaches biochemistry at Rhode Island University, over at Kingston, said within my hearing, and apropos of nothing more than that day\u2019s theatrical performance and the setting sun: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d\nOnly the dead had doppelg\u00e4ngers at that party back in 2001. Arthur Garvey Ulm, poet and Resident Secretary of Xanadu, an employee of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, was short and had a big nose, like my war buddy Bernard V. O\u2019Hare.\nMy wife Jill was among the living, thank goodness, and was there in the flesh, as was Knox Burger, a Cornell classmate of mine. After Western Civilization\u2019s second unsuccessful suicide attempt, Knox became a fiction editor at Collier\u2019s, which published five short stories every week. Knox got me a good literary agent, Colonel Kenneth Littauer, the first pilot to strafe a trench during World War One.\nTrout opined, in My Ten Years on Automatic Pilot, incidentally, that we had better start numbering timequakes the same way we numbered World Wars and Super Bowls.\nColonel Littauer sold a dozen or more of my stories, several to Knox, making it possible for me to quit my job with General Electric and move with Jane and our then two kids to Cape Cod as a free-lance writer. When the magazines went bust because of TV, Knox became an editor of paperback originals. He published three books of mine as such: The Sirens of Titan, Canary in a Cathouse, and Mother Night.\nKnox got me started, and he kept me going until he could no longer help me.

Oh, of course, the little boy. Well, what about Jerry, Colonel?\" asked Barzov. \"I\u2019ll make a special concession, if you like. Would you want to take the move back?\" The major was urbane, a caricature of cheerful hospitality.\n\"Without rules, Major, games become nonsense,\" said Kelly flatly. \"I\u2019d be the last to ask you to break them.\"\nBarzov\u2019s expression became one of profound sympathy. \"Your husband, madame, has made the decision, not I.\" He pressed the button on the stop watch. \"You may keep the boy with you until the Colonel has fumbled all of your lives away.

Kelly returned to his square, dug his hands into his pockets, and watched a servant take the black pawn from the board. \"Check, Major. Your king is in check.\"\nBarzov raised an eyebrow. \"Check, did you say? What shall I do about this annoyance? How shall I get you back to some of the more interesting problems on the board?\" He gestured to a servant. \"Move my king over one square to the left.\"\n\"Move diagonally one square toward me, Lieutenant,\" Kelly ordered the pilot. The pilot hesitated. \"Move!

Barry, a Jew named Joseph of Arimathea took Christ\u2019s goblet when the Last Supper was over. He believed Christ to be divine.\nJoseph brought the goblet to the Crucifixion, and some of Christ\u2019s blood fell into it. Joseph was arrested for his Christian sympathies. He was thrown into prison without food or water, but he survived for several years. He had the goblet with him, and every day it filled up with food and drink.\nSo the Romans let him go. They couldn\u2019t have known about the goblet, or they surely would have taken it from him. And Joseph went to England to spread the word about Christ. The goblet fed him on the way. And this wandering Jew founded the first Christian church in England\u2014at Glastonbury. He stuck his staff into the ground there, and it became a tree which bloomed every Christmas Eve.\nImagine that.\nJoseph had children, who inherited the goblet, which came to be known as the \u201cHoly Grail,\u201d\nBut sometime during the next five hundred years, the Holy Grail was lost. King Arthur and his knights would become obsessed with finding it again\u2014the most sacred relic in England. Knight after knight failed. Supernatural messages indicated that their hearts weren\u2019t pure enough for them to find the Grail.\nBut then Sir Galahad presented himself at Camelot, and it was evident to everyone that his heart was perfectly pure. And he did find the Grail. He was not only spiritually entitled to it. He was legally entitled to it as well, since he was the last living descendant of that wandering Jew, Joseph of Arimathea.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMr. Barry told me what the \u201cstock\u201d part of a \u201claughingstock\u201d was.

One thing was clear: Absolutely everybody in the city was supposed to be dead, regardless of what they were, and that anybody that moved in it represented a flaw in the design. There were to be no moon men at all.\nAmerican fighter planes came in under the smoke to see if anything was moving. They saw Billy and the rest moving down there. The planes sprayed them with machine-gun bullets, but the bullets missed. Then they saw some other people moving down by the riverside and they shot at them. They hit some of them. So it goes.\nThe idea was to hasten the end of the war.\nBilly\u2019s story ended very curiously in a suburb untouched by fire and explosions. The guards and the Americans came at nightfall to an inn which was open for business. There was candlelight. There were fires in three fireplaces downstairs. There were empty tables and chairs waiting for anyone who might come, and empty beds with covers turned down upstairs.\nThere was a blind innkeeper and his sighted wife, who was the cook, and their two young daughters, who worked as waitresses and maids. This family knew that Dresden was gone. Those with eyes had seen it burn and burn, understood that they were on the edge of a desert now. Still\u2014they had opened for business, had polished the glasses and wound the clocks and stirred the fires, and waited and waited to see who would come.\nThere was no great flow of refugees from Dresden. The clocks ticked on, the fires crackled, the translucent candles dripped. And then there was a knock on the door, and in came four guards and one hundred American prisoners of war.\nThe innkeeper asked the guards if they had come from the city.", 0.04202380952380953], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["messenger", 0.1436792065591273], ["shouted", 0.12798648159171014], ["whispered", 0.10775940491934546], ["room", 0.10694956549662625], ["grenade", 0.09664970971766386], ["shoved", 0.06771567308092952], ["confidential", 0.06771567308092952], ["unslung", 0.06771567308092952], ["shrilled", 0.06771567308092952], ["sighed", 0.06771567308092952], ["leveled", 0.06771567308092952], ["surround", 0.06771567308092952], ["breathed", 0.06771567308092952], ["shouts", 0.059364502230809704], ["hide", 0.059364502230809704], ["frequently", 0.059364502230809704], ["peep", 0.059364502230809704], ["guys", 0.059364502230809704], ["message", 0.05885173579202902], ["bee", 0.057868073273468656], ["pig", 0.05447938044637399], ["plugged", 0.05447938044637399], ["notice", 0.05447938044637399], ["frowned", 0.05447938044637399], ["blinked", 0.05447938044637399], ["concentrated", 0.05447938044637399], ["taped", 0.05447938044637399], ["reception", 0.05447938044637399], ["deeply", 0.05101333138068988], ["search", 0.05101333138068988], ["deserted", 0.05101333138068988], ["escape", 0.04832485485883193], ["strange", 0.04832485485883193], ["whistle", 0.04832485485883193], ["deserter", 0.04832485485883193], ["move", 0.04612820959625416], ["funny", 0.04612820959625416], ["excited", 0.04612820959625416], ["gaze", 0.04612820959625416], ["hand", 0.04536701801045257], ["ready", 0.04266216053057005], ["corridor", 0.041243087811818444], ["secret", 0.03882536858938289], ["recruits", 0.03882536858938289], ["eye", 0.037777038746134334], ["rifle", 0.03681266877416402], ["shut", 0.035919801639781826], ["top", 0.035088562224276386], ["moment", 0.033580572550131735], ["rest", 0.03224050465723747], ["face", 0.030474197739263065], ["dead", 0.029938634334795187], ["father", 0.027568630789662], ["army", 0.02714584380398405], ["friend", 0.02714584380398405], ["find", 0.026737391374156563], ["war", 0.026737391374156563], ["boy", 0.026737391374156563], ["time", 0.02647258526911108], ["best", 0.02558907595482735], ["man", 0.02495020209750791], ["unk", 0.02422362286447929], ["place", 0.02357637613960848], ["door", 0.022973840951961956], ["chrono", 0.016528983417684228], ["going", 0.015538162956997819]], "sentiment": ["Now the strange messenger concentrated his gaze on her face.

We are all so close together in time that we should think of ourselves as brothers and sisters. I have several children\u2014six, to be exact\u2014too many children for an atheist, certainly. Whenever my children complain about the planet to me, I say: \u2019Shut up! I just got here myself. Who do you think I am\u2014Methuselah? You think I like the news of the day any better than you do? You\u2019re wrong.\u2019\n\u201cWe are all experiencing more or less the same lifetime now.\n\u201cWhat is it the slightly older people want from the slightly younger people? They want credit for having survived so long, and often imaginatively, under difficult conditions. Slightly younger people are intolerably stingy about giving them credit for that.\n\u201cWhat is it the slightly younger people want from the slightly older people? More than anything, I think, they want acknowledgment and without further ado that they are, without question, women and men now. Slightly older people are intolerably stingy about making any such acknowledgment.", 0.11665707308564452], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["fingerprints", 0.1496576828923929], ["fired", 0.13092397530969166], ["story", 0.11208427884238198], ["christmas", 0.10105993902547758], ["hackleman", 0.09564650418934828], ["great", 0.08797453123102957], ["homicides", 0.07482884144619645], ["surplus", 0.07482884144619645], ["sacrilege", 0.07482884144619645], ["phony", 0.07482884144619645], ["disillusioned", 0.07482884144619645], ["january", 0.07482884144619645], ["entry", 0.07482884144619645], ["bills", 0.07482884144619645], ["lightbulbs", 0.06546198765484583], ["seventy", 0.06546198765484583], ["owns", 0.06546198765484583], ["neon", 0.05998272943716793], ["grandly", 0.05998272943716793], ["army", 0.05998272943716793], ["rubbed", 0.05998272943716793], ["future", 0.05998272943716793], ["motors", 0.05998272943716793], ["critical", 0.05998272943716793], ["outdoor", 0.05609513386349522], ["weather", 0.05609513386349522], ["counting", 0.05609513386349522], ["barn", 0.05609513386349522], ["wire", 0.05609513386349522], ["stories", 0.05609513386349522], ["subject", 0.05609513386349522], ["announced", 0.05609513386349522], ["sprague", 0.05307968046735725], ["balloon", 0.05307968046735725], ["suggestion", 0.05307968046735725], ["month", 0.05061587564581732], ["blank", 0.05061587564581732], ["follow", 0.05061587564581732], ["annual", 0.05061587564581732], ["forward", 0.04853275835085437], ["guy", 0.04672828007214461], ["electric", 0.04672828007214461], ["figures", 0.04672828007214461], ["fleetwood", 0.04672828007214461], ["contest", 0.045136617428139424], ["lighting", 0.045136617428139424], ["miles", 0.045136617428139424], ["thirty", 0.043712826676006636], ["town", 0.040167363642662164], ["job", 0.03823356845832874], ["desk", 0.03823356845832874], ["sick", 0.03654217463462595], ["find", 0.03576976363678881], ["inside", 0.03368664634182586], ["won", 0.03305799748189488], ["closed", 0.03080050985131155], ["hands", 0.029799050768153146], ["ten", 0.028423608953153923], ["small", 0.028423608953153923], ["mind", 0.025321251633633652], ["years", 0.02279981980146592], ["looked", 0.018627718698092766], ["good", 0.016484407479489545], ["going", 0.014324289899193652]], "sentiment": ["A small story inside announced that Mr. Sprague Fleetwood had won the Annual Christmas Outdoor Lighting Contest with thirty-two electric motors, two miles of wire, and nine hundred and seventy-six lightbulbs, not counting neon, and an Army surplus weather balloon.\nHackleman was on the job at his desk, critical and disillusioned as ever.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great, great story,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2019m good and sick of it,\u201d said Hackleman.

Caucasian, surely young and female skull belonged to. I want to rush out into the prison yard, formerly the Quadrangle, shouting \u201cEureka! Eureka!\u201d\nMy educated guess is that the skull belonged to Letitia Smiley, a reputedly beautiful, dyslexic Tarkington senior who disappeared from the campus in 1922, after winning the traditional Women\u2019s Barefoot Race from the bell tower to the President\u2019s House and back again. Letitia Smiley was crowned Lilac Queen as her prize, and she burst into tears for reasons nobody could understand. Something obviously was bothering her. People were agreed, I learn from a newspaper of the time, that Letitia Smiley\u2019s tears were not happy tears.\nOne suspicion had to be, although nobody said so for publication, that Miss Smiley was pregnant\u2014possibly by a member of the student body or faculty. I am playing detective now, with nothing but a skull and old newspapers to go on. But at least I have what the police were unable to find back then: what might be proof positive in the hands of a forensic cranial expert that Letitia Smiley was no longer among the living. The morning after she was crowned Lilac Queen, her bed was found to contain a dummy made of rolled-up bath towels. A souvenir football given to her by an admirer at Union College in Schenectady was the dummy\u2019s head. On it was painted: \u201cUnion 31, Hobart 3.\u201d\nAfter that: thin air.\nA DENTIST WOULD be no help in identifying the skull, since whoever owned it never had so much as a single cavity to be filled. Whoever it was had perfect teeth. Who is alive today who could tell us whether or not Letitia Smiley, who herself would be 100 years old now, in the year 2001, had perfect teeth?\nThat was how a lot of the more mutilated bodies of soldiers in Vietnam were positively identified, by their imperfect teeth.\nTHERE IS NO statute of limitations on murder, the most terrible crime of all, they say. But how old would her killer be by now? If he was who I think he was, he would be 135. I think he was none other than Kensington Barber, the Provost of Tarkington College at the time. He would spend his last days in the State Hospital for the Insane up in Batavia. I think it was he, empowered to make bed checks in both the women\u2019s and the men\u2019s dormitories, who made the dummy whose head was a football.\nI think Letitia Smiley was dead by then.\nAnd it was a matter of public record that it was the Provost who found the dummy.\nTHE MEDICAL EXAMINER from the State Police said it was odd that there was no hair still stuck to the skull. He thought it might have been scalped or boiled before it was buried, to make it that much harder to identify. And what have I discovered? That Letitia was famous in her short life for her long golden hair.

He missed fucking other men in the mouth and the asshole, and being fucked in the mouth and the asshole, and jerking off\u2014and fucking cows in the prison dairy, all events in a normal sex life on the planet, as far as he knew.\nHere would be a good tombstone for Wayne Hoobler when he died:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe dairy at the prison provided milk and cream and butter and cheese and ice cream not only for the prison and the County Hospital. It sold its products to the outside world, too. Its trademark didn\u2019t mention prison. This was it:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWayne couldn\u2019t read very well. The words Hawaii and Hawaiian, for instance, appeared in combination with more familiar words and symbols in signs painted on the windows of the showroom and on the windshields of some used cars. Wayne tried to decode the mysterious words phonetically, without any satisfaction. \u201cWahee-io,\u201d he would say, and \u201cHoo-he-woo-hi,\u201d and so on.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWayne Hoobler smiled now, not because he was happy but because, with so little to do, he thought he might as well show off his teeth. They were excellent teeth. The Adult Correctional Institution at Shepherdstown was proud of its dentistry program.\nIt was such a famous dental program, in fact, that it had been written up in medical journals and in the Reader\u2019s Digest, which was the dying planet\u2019s most popular magazine. The theory behind the program was that many ex-convicts could not or would not get jobs because of their appearances, and good looks began with good teeth.", 0.23083333333333333], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["letter", 0.24184177611507832], ["read", 0.23317721431468516], ["desk", 0.1991141734563751], ["tools", 0.15038923121999717], ["bag", 0.15038923121999717], ["spartan", 0.15038923121999717], ["isolation", 0.15038923121999717], ["magnificent", 0.12938477120302913], ["questioningly", 0.12938477120302913], ["aloud", 0.12938477120302913], ["office", 0.11709794974520599], ["hurried", 0.10838031118606112], ["drawers", 0.10838031118606112], ["drawer", 0.09609348972823796], ["special", 0.09609348972823796], ["shrugged", 0.08380666827041479], ["opened", 0.08380666827041479], ["fine", 0.08061392537169278], ["top", 0.08061392537169278], ["threw", 0.08061392537169278], ["middle", 0.08061392537169278], ["lay", 0.07266349311510215], ["sat", 0.07041779698923177], ["room", 0.07041779698923177], ["turned", 0.06116380760889293], ["looked", 0.042651411174863436], ["work", 0.038605005337756695]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHe turned it over to me.
