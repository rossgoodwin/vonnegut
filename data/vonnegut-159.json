He congratulated himself on his calm, his reasonableness with respect to the little people. He hadn\u2019t panicked, hadn\u2019t killed them or called for help. He doubted that many people would have had the imagination to admit that the little people really were explorers from another world, and that the seeming knife was really a spaceship.\n\u201cGuess you picked the right man to come and see,\u201d he murmured to them from a distance, \u201cbut darned if I know what to do with you. If word got out about you, it\u2019d be murder.\u201d He could imagine the panic and the mobs outside the apartment.\nAs Lowell approached the little people for another look, crossing the carpet silently, there came a ticking from the bell jar, as one of the men circled inside it again and again, tapping with some sort of tool, seeking an opening.

My sister, although her family was broke, went there. My first wife, although her family was broke, went there.\nThe name of the jeweler was Iku Matsu Moto. He had many secrets, probably because his customers asked him very little about himself It turned out that he used to be a strong man with Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\nSo he appeared at the main store of Vonnegut Hardware Company on East Washington Street one day, and he wanted an anvil. His shop was on Monument Circle, three blocks away. In Indianapolis, which was laid out by Pierre Charles L\u2019Enfant, the same Frenchman who laid out Washington, D.C., each block is one tenth of a mile on a side.\nSo Iku Matsu Moto found an anvil he liked, and he asked the salesman how much it cost. The salesman told him jocularly that he could have it for nothing if Iku Matsu Moto could carry it home. So Iku Matsu Moto carried it home.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI scarcely know any of the few Vonneguts still living in Indianapolis, and my own children will know and care about them as much as I know or care about my German relatives. Things fall apart.\nThere is a Bernard Vonnegut in Albany. That\u2019s my brother, I believe. And there is a Peter Vonnegut there, who is Bernard\u2019s son, and who is a librarian, and who married a woman named Michi Minatoya, who, like Iku Matsu Moto, is of Japanese ancestry. They have two children, Carl Hiroaki Vonnegut and Emiko Alice Vonnegut, my brother\u2019s only grandchildren. They, too, are, among other things, de St. Andr\u00e9s. Strange and nice.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere is a Dr. Mark Vonnegut in Brookline, Massachusetts. That\u2019s my son, I believe.\nI am proud of Mark, and I praised him and drew on his experience in this manner at a meeting of the Mental Health Association in New Jersey in Morristown on June 4, 1980:", 0.16070454545454546], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["blue", 0.20362144871255355], ["shield", 0.15252089801367455], ["cross", 0.09744796926682607], ["mercedes", 0.09033529676830986], ["summer", 0.07131384561098869], ["fringe", 0.05084029933789152], ["shebang", 0.05084029933789152], ["commuters", 0.05084029933789152], ["commute", 0.05084029933789152], ["unceasing", 0.05084029933789152], ["occupancy", 0.05084029933789152], ["compensation", 0.05084029933789152], ["august", 0.05084029933789152], ["benefits", 0.05084029933789152], ["commuted", 0.05084029933789152], ["livable", 0.05084029933789152], ["unionized", 0.05084029933789152], ["stay", 0.04936760391654187], ["owned", 0.048223743127552544], ["exaggeration", 0.04430117499298637], ["session", 0.04430117499298637], ["work", 0.04416312264134168], ["skating", 0.04047603246366406], ["demands", 0.04047603246366406], ["rink", 0.04047603246366406], ["travel", 0.04047603246366406], ["slight", 0.04047603246366406], ["excellent", 0.04047603246366406], ["salary", 0.04047603246366406], ["japanese", 0.03880881546493013], ["ready", 0.037762050648081226], ["house", 0.037507063172723495], ["prison", 0.03571398012551639], ["decide", 0.035656922805494345], ["staff", 0.035656922805494345], ["nigger", 0.035656922805494345], ["barracks", 0.035656922805494345], ["break", 0.034598559779756365], ["fly", 0.03393690811875892], ["live", 0.03393690811875892], ["cost", 0.03393690811875892], ["ghost", 0.03393690811875892], ["owners", 0.03393690811875892], ["will", 0.03355007202211842], ["airplane", 0.03248265642227535], ["inmates", 0.03248265642227535], ["corporation", 0.03248265642227535], ["sell", 0.031222926303176083], ["truth", 0.031222926303176083], ["property", 0.0291177984605892], ["reason", 0.028218645820925755], ["15", 0.028218645820925755], ["practically", 0.028218645820925755], ["common", 0.028218645820925755], ["paid", 0.027397783773853778], ["cough", 0.027397783773853778], ["dying", 0.02664266389014117], ["pay", 0.02664266389014117], ["including", 0.025292655931266894], ["problem", 0.025292655931266894], ["scipio", 0.024428814482913213], ["alton", 0.024111871563776272], ["darwin", 0.024111871563776272], ["bought", 0.024111871563776272], ["surely", 0.024111871563776272], ["car", 0.024111871563776272], ["days", 0.02306257311934019], ["college", 0.022918574715487992], ["teacher", 0.022578674115684056], ["tarkington", 0.020471823332308136], ["rochester", 0.020103539545236027], ["state", 0.019404407732465066], ["wouldn", 0.017854378946698307], ["town", 0.017854378946698307], ["athena", 0.015140397131115469], ["day", 0.013934421928192026], ["man", 0.013208374370304022], ["thing", 0.012865283387559922], ["years", 0.009383231840981717], ["told", 0.008601272786210324]], "sentiment": ["IF I DIDN\u2019T work out for some reason, he said, he would still need a teacher on the property, who would surely not want to live in the barracks.

"sentiment": ["Her doctor wasn\u2019t there.\nBoth her parents were dead, and all her brothers and sisters had drifted off to God-knows-where. One brother, I know, was killed in the Korean War. And somebody swore, I remember, that he had seen her sister Shirley as an extra in the remake of the movie King Kong. Maybe so.\nThere were maybe two hundred mourners there. Most of them were employees and friends and customers and suppliers of Dwayne\u2019s. The word was all over town of how in need of support he was, of how vocally ashamed he was to have been such a bad husband that his wife had committed suicide. He had been quoted to me as having made a public announcement in the Tally-ho Room of the new Holiday Inn, the day after Celia killed herself: \u201cI take half the blame, but the other half goes to that son-of-bitching Doctor Jerry Mitchell. Watch out for the pills your doctor tells your wife to take. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt must have been a startling scene. From five until six thirty or so every weekday night, the Tally-ho Room, the cocktail lounge, was a plenary session of the oligarchy of Midland City. A few powerful people, most notably Fred T. Barry, were involved in planetary games, so that the deliberations at the Tally-ho Room were beneath their notice. But anyone doing big business or hoping to do big business strictly within the county was foolish not to show his face there at least once a week, if only to drink a glass of ginger ale. The Tally-ho Room did a very big trade in ginger ale.\nDwayne owned a piece of the new Holiday Inn, incidentally. His automobile dealership was right next door, on the same continuous sheet of blacktop. And the Tally-ho Room was where his disinherited son, Bunny, played the piano. The story was that Bunny applied for the job there, and the manager of the Inn asked Dwayne how he felt about it, and Dwayne said he had never heard of Bunny, so he did not care if the Inn hired him or not, as long as he could play the piano.\nAnd then Dwayne added, supposedly, that he himself hated piano music, since it interfered with conversation. All he asked was that there be no piano playing until eight o\u2019clock at night. That way, although he did not say so, Dwayne Hoover would never have to lay eyes on his disgraceful son.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI daydreamed at Celia\u2019s funeral. There was no reason to expect that anything truly exciting or consoling would be said. Not even the minister, the Reverend Charles Harrell, believed in heaven or hell. Not even the minister thought that every life had a meaning, and that every death could startle us into learning something important, and so on. The corpse was a mediocrity who had broken down after a while. The mourners were mediocrities who would break down after a while.\nThe city itself was breaking down. Its center was already dead. Everybody shopped at the outlying malls. Heavy industry had gone bust.

of good-bye and good-bye and good-bye,\u201d Vonnegut wrote in an introduction to the book publication of his play Happy Birthday, Wanda June, speaking of the time he left the Cape and moved to New York. It was a time \u201cwhen my six children were no more [living at home in the family house on Cape Cod].\u2026 I was drinking more and arguing a lot and I had to get out of that house.\u2026\u201d In writing Wanda June (based on his play Penelope, which was performed fifteen years before on Cape Cod), \u201cI was writing myself a new family and a new early manhood.\u201d He regarded the actors as his \u201cnew family,\u201d though after the last performance in 1971, \u201cMy new family dissolved into the late afternoon.\u201d\nDuring his work on the play, the photographer Jill Krementz came to \u201cchronicle\u201d him photographically, and he began a relationship with her that led to their living together in a townhouse he bought on East 48th Street in Manhattan in 1973. Together they bought a house in Sagaponack on Long Island in 1977 and were married in 1979. Many famous writers were Long Island neighbors in summer, such as James Jones, Irwin Shaw, Nelson Algren, and Truman Capote.\nVonnegut found and became part of other extended families, which he felt were so important\u2014the family of American writers (symbolized by his induction into the National Institute of Arts and Letters) and the family of writers throughout the world. He became an officer of PEN, fighting for the causes of writers who had been jailed in totalitarian countries and working tirelessly to champion his Russian translator, Rita Rait, whom he would finally bring on a visit to the U.S. in 1984.\nHe used to say that when history later looked back on America, it might well regard Alcoholics Anonymous as this country\u2019s greatest contribution to the world\u2014because it provided people with an extended family, one whose members would greet them and give them a place to go in every city in the country and around the world. He was proud of the fact that his uncle Alex had founded the first Alcoholics Anonymous chapter in Indianapolis.\nThough never a member of a church, Kurt often advised people who had just gotten out of prison, or were for any reason lonely or new in a community, to join a church because it provided an instant extended family.\nThe public awareness of Vonnegut and his books continued to spread in 1972 when an excellent movie was made of Slaughterhouse-Five by the highly regarded director George Roy Hill. Kurt was delighted with the film; he told me later: \u201cThey did the movie just like they did Gone with the Wind\u2014they simply \u2018put the novel on the screen.\u2019 \u201d\nAs he and his books became famous, there were more and more attempts to censor them, and he passionately defended the teachers and librarians who fought for their right to use them in schools and libraries. After the burning of copies of Slaughterhouse-Five in a furnace in Drake, North Dakota, on orders of its school board, and the banning of it by the school board in Levittown, New York, Vonnegut wrote in an op-ed piece for The New York Times on March 24, 1976, that \u201cWhenever ideas are squashed in this country, literate lovers of the American experiment write careful and intricate explanations of why all ideas must be allowed to live. It is time for them to realize that they are attempting to explain America at its bravest and most optimistic to orangutans.\n\u201cFrom now on, I intend to limit my discourse with dimwitted Savonarolas to this advice: \u2018Have somebody read the First Amendment to the United States Constitution out loud to you, you God damned fool!\u2019 \u201d\nVonnegut\u2019s first novel after Slaughterhouse-Five was Breakfast of Champions, published in 1973. In the same year, \u201cTwo nice young college professors,\u201d Jerome Klinkowitz and John Somer, published The Vonnegut Statement, a collection of essays on the author and his work.
