The idea she wanted to add to her book was straight in her mind now.\n\"The worst thing that could possibly happen to anybody,\" she said, \"would be to not be used for anything by anybody.\"\nThe thought relaxed her.

David pushed through the hedges into the outfield of a softball diamond.

Maybe he could leave a message for Flammer, saying he\u2019d suddenly fallen ill, which was essentially true, or\u2014\n\"There he goes!\" cried somebody from the other side of the diamond. There were gleeful cries, shouted orders, the sounds of men running.\nA deer with broken antlers dashed under the bleachers, saw David, and ran frantically into the open again along the fence. He ran with a limp, and his reddish-brown coat was streaked with soot and grease.\n\"Easy now! Don\u2019t rush him! Just keep him there. Shoot into the woods, not the Works.\"\nDavid came out from under the bleachers to see a great semicircle of men, several ranks deep, closing in slowly on the corner of fence in which the deer was at bay.
