They make me very cheerful. The cloth is in a place of honor in my library, along with gifts from Rita.\nOur meeting in Leningrad meant a lot to me, too. You were such a vivacious guide in what may be the most beautiful city in the world. I will never forget how you took us right down by the water, at the base of the old beacon to give us the most stunning and mystical view of all.\nIt makes me happy that you want me to go on writing. The difficulty is not in writing but in writing well. Rita\u2019s blazing intelligence at her advanced age is an inspiration to me. I myself feel that I am growing more stupid with each passing year. Then again\u2014Rita does not smoke as I do. I quit smoking for a month, but now I am back at it again. It is as though I have made a very bad bargain with the Devil. I cannot write unless I hurt myself some. This is stupid. In my latest book I include a quotation from Schiller, which perhaps you know: \u201cAgainst stupidity even the gods struggle in vain.\u201d\nYes, there is another book by me, as Don may have told you. I have just corrected the printer\u2019s proofs. They did not even look like English to me. I think I have lost control of the language.\nThis is a perfectly heavenly spring here, at any rate. Last weekend Jill (whom you will meet some day) and I drove 200 versts north of New York City to see my new grandchild, a little girl named India, in a forest in Massachusetts. The father is one of my three adopted children, who is a carpenter. I also have three natural children. The carpenter is now the age I was when I adopted him, which is thirty-five.
