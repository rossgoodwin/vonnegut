Yet again I trot onstage the only real villain in my story: the oversize human brain.\nNobody leads a life of quiet desperation nowadays. The mass of men was quietly desperate a million years ago because the infernal computers inside their skulls were incapable of restraint or idleness; were forever demanding more challenging problems which life could not provide.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI have now described almost all of the events and circumstances crucial, in my opinion, to the miraculous survival of humankind to the present day. I remember them as though they were queerly shaped keys to many locked doors, the final door opening on perfect happiness.\nOne of those keys, surely, was the absence of tools on Santa Rosalia, save for feeble combinations of bones and twigs and rocks and fish guts\u2014and bird guts.\nIf the Captain had had any decent tools, crowbars and picks and shovels and so on, he surely would have found a way, in the name of science and progress, to clog the spring, or to cause it to vomit the entire contents of the crater in only a week or two.\nAs for the balance the colonists established between themselves and their food supply: I have to say that that, too, was based on luck rather than intelligence.\nNature chose to be generous, so there was enough to eat. The birds on the other islands were having good years, and so sent emigrants from overpopulated rookeries to Santa Rosalia to take over the nests of those eaten by the people. There was no such natural replacement scheme for the marine iguanas, who were not long-distance swimmers.

The leading character was a rabbit who lived like all the other wild rabbits, but who was as intelligent as Albert Einstein or William Shakespeare. It was a female rabbit. She was the only female leading character in any novel or story by Kilgore Trout.\nShe led a normal female rabbit\u2019s life, despite her ballooning intellect. She concluded that her mind was useless, that it was a sort of tumor, that it had no usefulness within the rabbit scheme of things.\nSo she went hippity-hop, hippity-hop toward the city, to have the tumor removed. But a hunter named Dudley Farrow shot and killed her before she got there. Farrow skinned her and took out her guts, but then he and his wife Grace decided that they had better not eat her because of her unusually large head. They thought what she had thought when she was alive\u2014that she must be diseased.\nAnd so on.", 0.02353479853479854], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["paul", 0.19821729451346215], ["rush", 0.09048603791933428], ["ball", 0.07508276724022438], ["grace", 0.06607243150448738], ["fives", 0.06515145750664553], ["mommy", 0.06515145750664553], ["tabu", 0.06515145750664553], ["befuddling", 0.06515145750664553], ["stained", 0.06515145750664553], ["chrysanthemum", 0.06515145750664553], ["dreadfully", 0.06515145750664553], ["wistfully", 0.06515145750664553], ["musk", 0.06515145750664553], ["princesses", 0.06515145750664553], ["kleenex", 0.06515145750664553], ["lag", 0.06515145750664553], ["initial", 0.06515145750664553], ["petals", 0.06515145750664553], ["pleasantries", 0.06515145750664553], ["pungent", 0.06515145750664553], ["frowzy", 0.057449822167090575], ["tens", 0.057449822167090575], ["smell", 0.057449822167090575], ["uncomfortably", 0.057449822167090575], ["fairy", 0.057449822167090575], ["held", 0.05625392589828651], ["sparrow", 0.052944654299222085], ["sniffed", 0.052944654299222085], ["lipstick", 0.052944654299222085], ["gaily", 0.052944654299222085], ["mansions", 0.052944654299222085], ["bloomed", 0.052944654299222085], ["perfume", 0.052944654299222085], ["asleep", 0.04974818682753564], ["reached", 0.04974818682753564], ["1955", 0.04974818682753564], ["twenties", 0.04974818682753564], ["mcclellans", 0.04974818682753564], ["mother", 0.047779091308750875], ["rising", 0.047268814035155524], ["childhood", 0.047268814035155524], ["mind", 0.04571041524061727], ["neighbors", 0.04524301895966714], ["bright", 0.04524301895966714], ["stately", 0.04524301895966714], ["pockets", 0.04524301895966714], ["quick", 0.04204655148798068], ["father", 0.04125106645256947], ["realized", 0.040737851091798644], ["nose", 0.040737851091798644], ["conversation", 0.03956717869560057], ["expected", 0.03850817669777474], ["rolled", 0.03850817669777474], ["pocket", 0.03850817669777474], ["clothes", 0.03850817669777474], ["subject", 0.03582859828869821], ["telling", 0.03506201082773208], ["boy", 0.03465702405319839], ["boys", 0.03434491614842573], ["sighed", 0.033671309239354234], ["hours", 0.03303621575224369], ["short", 0.03303621575224369], ["eyes", 0.03264848935390352], ["village", 0.03243546884924063], ["thinking", 0.029386170563665513], ["talking", 0.02895038486196239], ["brought", 0.028531047884375202], ["george", 0.028531047884375202], ["hard", 0.026996044123477232], ["air", 0.02564759015676315], ["matter", 0.024163908016490678], ["hands", 0.023889545654375437], ["call", 0.022372039709867092], ["young", 0.021464506031930793], ["big", 0.019658740148622185], ["years", 0.019475081238053176]], "sentiment": ["\"He\u2019s not a little boy\u2014he\u2019s a big boy,\" said Paul\u2019s father. \"And he\u2019s too old to be thinking about fairy princesses.\"\nPaul\u2019s mother held up her hands. \"Don\u2019t rush it, don\u2019t rush it.

She replied that I had to understand that they were all Victorians and too old to change. They could not help themselves when it came to loathing dirty books.\nSo I thought about Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the Empress of India, who lived from 1819, long before my first ancestor arrived in this country, until 1901, when my father was a junior in Shortridge High School. And I asked myself why any mention of bodily functions should have pained this queen so.\nI cannot believe that Victoria herself would have suffered a moment\u2019s genuine dismay if I had shown her the picture of my asshole which I drew for my book Breakfast of Champions. My asshole looks like this:\nI also feature my asshole in my signature, which looks like this:\nWhat would Queen Victoria really feel in the presence of what she had declared to be obscenities? That her power to intimidate was being attacked ever so slightly, far, far from its center, was being attacked where it could not matter much as yet\u2014was being attacked way out on the edge. She created arbitrary rules for that outermost edge to warn her of the approach of anyone so crude, so rash as to bring to her attention the suffering of the Irish, or the cruelties of the factory system, or the privileges of the nobility, or the approach of a world war, and on and on? If she would not even acknowledge that human beings sometimes farted, how could she be expected to hear without swooning of these other things?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhat a subtle scheme Queen Victoria evolved to make people hesitant about discussing their entitlement to more control over their lives.
