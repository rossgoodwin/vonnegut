I\u2019ve deposited my first check in a savings account and, as and if I sell more, will continue to do so until I have the equivalent of one year\u2019s pay at GE. Four more stories will do it nicely, with cash to spare (something we never had before). I will then quit this goddamn nightmare job, and never take another one so long as I live, so help me God.\nI\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve been for a good many years.\nLove.\nK\nTHE FIFTIES\nHis job in public relations for General Electric not only provided Kurt with a salary to support himself and his family, it also gave him ideas for short stories as well as his first novel, Player Piano.\nAs Vonnegut later explained in his Paris Review interview, the payment of $750 for his story \u201cwas six weeks\u2019 pay at G.E. I wrote another, and he [Knox Burger] paid me nine hundred and fifty dollars, and suggested that it was perhaps time for me to quit GE.\u201d Kurt took the advice and moved to Osterville on Cape Cod. His price for a story eventually \u201cgot up to twenty-nine hundred a crack,\u201d he told his interviewers. \u201cThink of that.\u201d\nNo matter what Vonnegut was paid for his stories, it wasn\u2019t regular, much less guaranteed. When I met Kurt for the first time in 1963, he looked back fondly on what seemed like \u201ca magical year\u201d in those early days, when all the stories that he sent out were sold, but there was also a year when none of them sold. \u201cMy cash cows the slick magazines were put out of business by TV,\u201d he later explained. Player Piano was published in 1952, selected by the Doubleday Fiction Book Club in 1953, and reprinted the following year under the title Utopia 14. Knox Burger, who had left Collier\u2019s to become an editor of paperback originals at Dell, published The Sirens of Titan in 1959. Despite these publications, Vonnegut had to take an assortment of jobs to keep afloat during the decade.\nOne of Kurt\u2019s ill-fated efforts to earn money in this period was a tryout to write for Sports Illustrated, a new magazine of Time Inc. He was assigned to write an article about a racehorse that had bolted when the starting gun went off at Aqueduct and jumped over the railing of the infield. After thinking about it for an hour or so, Vonnegut wrote, \u201cThe horse jumped over the fucking fence,\u201d walked out of the office, and went home.\nAt one point he tried inventing a board game, but it didn\u2019t sell. Perhaps the oddest and most challenging of his odd jobs was becoming the owner and manager of SAAB Cape Cod, an automobile dealership in West Barnstable, where he had bought a house. He wrote in the introduction to the 1999 collection of stories Bagombo Snuff Box that \u201cIf you left a Saab parked for more than a day, the oil settled like maple syrup to the bottom of the gas tank. When you started it up, the exhaust would black out a whole neighborhood. One time I blacked out Woods Hole that day. I was coughing like everybody else. I couldn\u2019t imagine where all the smoke had come from.\u201d", 0.1400717703349282], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["magazines", 0.06127786308520648], ["pinball",

I said, \u201cMy uncle Alex Vonnegut, a Harvard-educated life insurance salesman who lived at 5033 North Pennsylvania Street, taught me something very important. He said that when things were really going well we should be sure to notice it.\n\u201cHe was talking about simple occasions, not great victories: maybe drinking lemonade on a hot afternoon in the shade, or smelling the aroma of a nearby bakery, or fishing and not caring if we catch anything or not, or hearing somebody all alone playing a piano really well in the house next door.\n\u201cUncle Alex urged me to say this out loud during such epiphanies: \u2018If this isn\u2019t nice, what is?\u2019 \u201d\nAnother way I was lucky: for the first thirty-three years of my life, telling short stories with ink on paper was a major American industry. Although I then had a wife and two children, it made good business sense for me to quit my job as a publicity man for General Electric, with health insurance and a retirement plan. I could make more money selling stories to The Saturday Evening Post and Collier\u2019s, weekly magazines full of ads, which published five short stories and an installment of a cliff-hanging serial in every issue.\nThose were just the top-paying buyers of what I could produce. There were so many other magazines hungry for fiction that the market for stories was like a pinball machine. When I mailed off a story to my agent, I could be pretty sure somebody would pay me something for it, even though it might be rejected again and again.\nBut not long after I moved my family from Schenectady, New York, to Cape Cod, television, a much better buy for advertisers than magazines, made playing short story pinball for a living obsolete.\nI commuted from the Cape to Boston to work for an industrial advertising agency, and then became a dealer in Saab automobiles, and then taught high school English in a private school for seriously fucked-up rich kids.\nMy son the doctor Mark Vonnegut, who wrote a swell book about his going crazy in the 1960s, and then graduated from Harvard Medical School, had an exhibition of his watercolors in Milton, Massachusetts, this summer. A reporter asked him what it had been like to grow up with a famous father.\nMark replied, \u201cWhen I was growing up, my father was a car salesman who couldn\u2019t get a job teaching at Cape Cod Junior College.\u201d\n5", 0.1649692874692875], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["harry", 0.25948375079392505], ["stell", 0.19545437251993655], ["helene", 0.17531005413866038], ["nash", 0.09453762807031105], ["stella", 0.0870604672565063], ["scene", 0.07508276724022438], ["hands", 0.07166863696312631], ["mold", 0.06515145750664553], ["cranberry", 0.06515145750664553], ["sneer", 0.06515145750664553], ["playbooks", 0.06515145750664553], ["reunion", 0.06515145750664553], ["dragging", 0.057449822167090575], ["diver", 0.057449822167090575], ["juice", 0.057449822167090575], ["knuckles", 0.057449822167090575], ["character", 0.057449822167090575], ["weeping", 0.057449822167090575], ["clumping", 0.052944654299222085], ["naked", 0.052944654299222085], ["imaginary", 0.052944654299222085], ["snatched", 0.052944654299222085], ["play", 0.0526027469807026], ["hunched", 0.04974818682753564], ["brando", 0.04524301895966714], ["burned", 0.04524301895966714], ["pockets", 0.04524301895966714], ["library", 0.04524301895966714], ["marlon", 0.04524301895966714], ["shake", 0.04353023362825315], ["sea", 0.04353023362825315], ["shaw", 0.04353023362825315], ["offer", 0.04353023362825315], ["faster", 0.04353023362825315], ["shoes", 0.04204655148798068], ["pushed", 0.04204655148798068], ["lead", 0.04204655148798068], ["stairs", 0.04204655148798068], ["heavy", 0.040737851091798644], ["sounded", 0.040737851091798644], ["handed", 0.03956717869560057], ["fight", 0.03956717869560057], ["sight", 0.03956717869560057], ["turning", 0.03850817669777474], ["clothes", 0.03850817669777474], ["color", 0.03754138362011219], ["deep", 0.03754138362011219], ["upstairs", 0.03754138362011219], ["working", 0.03754138362011219], ["bottle", 0.03754138362011219], ["practically", 0.03665202020151734], ["throw", 0.03582859828869821], ["meet", 0.03506201082773208], ["tears", 0.033671309239354234], ["wonder", 0.033671309239354234], ["eyes", 0.03264848935390352], ["weren", 0.03186554335604563], ["game", 0.03132343042082972], ["husband", 0.03031263288521053], ["stopped", 0.02983974828055724], ["word", 0.029386170563665513], ["book", 0.02895038486196239], ["coming", 0.0263013734903513], ["floor", 0.024733833509685686], ["kind", 0.024733833509685686], ["woman", 0.023621795081274766], ["left", 0.018432650624523678], ["wife", 0.018105829677787087], ["turned", 0.01778834776174202], ["looked", 0.013547114182852494]], "sentiment": ["\"I\u2014\" said Helene, and she pushed on the imaginary bottle again. \"I just don\u2019t know how to begin,\" she said.\nThere was heavy clumping on the library stairs.

He would become a spokesman in America for the new social order which was being born in Germany, but which in time would be the salvation of the world.\nThis was quite a mistake.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.041909090909090924], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["purgatory", 0.20535641798274468], ["hell", 0.16684843291594958], ["eden", 0.12531956128064417], ["attic", 0.11623749476789459], ["york", 0.10667419971157131], ["park", 0.10551535612178857], ["worse", 0.08819719030549385], ["israel", 0.08130684582501133], ["rented", 0.07835424190700935], ["streets", 0.07835424190700935], ["unrecognized", 0.07835424190700935], ["inhabit", 0.07835424190700935], ["squeaking", 0.07835424190700935], ["depressing", 0.07835424190700935], ["pleasant", 0.07835424190700935], ["city", 0.0725816558378347], ["rats", 0.06845213932758155], ["overlooked", 0.06845213932758155], ["6", 0.06845213932758155], ["houses", 0.06845213932758155], ["scrabbling", 0.06845213932758155], ["yards", 0.06845213932758155], ["reappeared", 0.06845213932758155], ["formed", 0.06265978064032209], ["sides", 0.06265978064032209], ["walled", 0.06265978064032209], ["walls", 0.05855003674815377], ["continued", 0.05536227172937935], ["mengel", 0.05536227172937935], ["heaven", 0.05536227172937935], ["disappeared", 0.052757678060894285], ["ratty", 0.052757678060894285], ["month", 0.05055552549193345], ["fifteen", 0.05055552549193345], ["joined", 0.05055552549193345], ["greenwich", 0.04864793416872598], ["apartment", 0.046965319373634795], ["village", 0.04546016914995156], ["private", 0.04546016914995156], ["sense", 0.04546016914995156], ["lived", 0.04546016914995156], ["brought", 0.04546016914995156], ["window", 0.0428555754814665], ["coming", 0.041712108228987396], ["ago", 0.04065342291250566], ["trial", 0.04065342291250566], ["dream", 0.04065342291250566], ["mine", 0.038745831589298195], ["second", 0.03419649257331913], ["germany", 0.02929728184293584], ["long", 0.0288437290098704], ["years", 0.026769700297806148], ["thing", 0.02601764696230012], ["things", 0.023051370322610915], ["time", 0.017867006127048512], ["war", 0.017661452734875654]], "sentiment": ["That made sense, too, as do most of the things I dream.

The solid thumps carried to the ears of Haley, who threw back his covers and ran to the window. In the silent patch of blues and blacks below him, he saw Roy moving toward the house, staggering beneath the weight of a tall ladder. Roy stood the ladder upright and leaned it in toward Haley\u2019s windowsill. The ladder gathered speed as it fell toward the house, and Roy was without leverage to stop it as it threatened to hit the clapboard siding with a thundering whack. Haley leaned out and caught the ladder just before it hit, and his hand served as a cushion between it and the house. In spite of himself he cried out and jerked his hand, which stung smartly and bled.\nRoy soon popped his colorful head into the window, and Hope and Kitty slipped through the bedroom door, looking furtively over their shoulders and struggling with several large pieces of luggage.\n\u201cWho yelled?\u201d whispered Hope angrily.\nHaley appealed with his eyes to Roy for vindication, but Roy, florid and perspiring, was staring amazed at the baggage Kitty expected to carry away on the nuptial motorcycle. Haley guessed, from what little he knew of Roy, that the idea of spiriting his love away had delighted him, but that the mechanical difficulties inherent in the desperate venture now depressed him terribly. Haley counted seven separate pieces of luggage.\n\u201cDarling,\u201d whispered Kitty, throwing her arms about Roy\u2019s neck.", -0.0033333333333333327], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["telephone", 0.06331720708832181], ["coffee", 0.037770573557621805], ["livid", 0.031658603544160904], ["desk", 0.031658603544160904], ["lapsed", 0.031658603544160904], ["hush", 0.031658603544160904], ["begun", 0.031658603544160904], ["strangers", 0.031658603544160904], ["theory", 0.031658603544160904], ["poise", 0.031658603544160904], ["sins", 0.031658603544160904], ["contemplate", 0.031658603544160904], ["ache", 0.031658603544160904], ["broken", 0.031658603544160904], ["yells", 0.031658603544160904], ["hearing", 0.031658603544160904], ["cups", 0.031658603544160904], ["pouring", 0.031658603544160904], ["knuckles", 0.031658603544160904], ["hissed", 0.031658603544160904], ["dialing", 0.031658603544160904], ["places", 0.031658603544160904], ["impersonal", 0.031658603544160904], ["tearfully", 0.031658603544160904], ["defiant", 0.031658603544160904], ["test", 0.031658603544160904], ["lecturer", 0.031658603544160904], ["polite", 0.031658603544160904], ["breathed", 0.031658603544160904], ["noooo", 0.031658603544160904], ["welt", 0.031658603544160904], ["push", 0.031658603544160904], ["sensed", 0.031658603544160904], ["dot", 0.031658603544160904], ["minutes", 0.03031019849022918], ["ladder", 0.03031019849022918], ["skin", 0.0261574354444788], ["worried", 0.0261574354444788], ["bully", 0.0261574354444788], ["fifteen", 0.0261574354444788], ["fragrance", 0.0261574354444788], ["weren", 0.0261574354444788], ["examined", 0.0261574354444788], ["sense", 0.0261574354444788], ["hallway", 0.0261574354444788], ["despondent", 0.0261574354444788], ["hall", 0.022939458396001304], ["luggage", 0.022939458396001304], ["faint", 0.022939458396001304], ["baby", 0.022939458396001304], ["downstairs", 0.022939458396001304], ["fun", 0.022939458396001304], ["indicated", 0.022939458396001304], ["helped", 0.022939458396001304], ["stepped", 0.022939458396001304], ["awe", 0.022939458396001304], ["heavily", 0.020656267344796694], ["blow", 0.020656267344796694], ["shouting", 0.020656267344796694], ["watch", 0.020656267344796694], ["idea", 0.020656267344796694], ["objected", 0.020656267344796694], ["talking", 0.020656267344796694], ["sit", 0.020656267344796694], ["sat", 0.01930786229086497], ["daddy", 0.018885286778810902], ["tone", 0.018885286778810902], ["crossed", 0.018885286778810902], ["couch", 0.018885286778810902], ["cigarette", 0.018885286778810902], ["police", 0.0174382902963192], ["ten", 0.0174382902963192], ["darkness", 0.0174382902963192], ["suddenly", 0.0174382902963192], ["paused", 0.0174382902963192], ["edge", 0.0174382902963192], ["told", 0.01621487220245207], ["silence", 0.01621487220245207], ["war", 0.01621487220245207], ["began", 0.01621487220245207], ["annie", 0.0156341741300887], ["moving", 0.01515509924511459], ["love", 0.014220313247841706], ["hear", 0.014220313247841706], ["people", 0.013384118679128799], ["pretty", 0.012627688680681776], ["three", 0.011937122196637095], ["small", 0.01130186261192649], ["time", 0.01100233619936421], ["hope", 0.010846853850986283], ["roy", 0.010713704102769967], ["light", 0.010713704102769967], ["long", 0.010166141630651302], ["voice", 0.009653931145432485], ["sunroom", 0.009653931145432485], ["thought", 0.009653931145432485], ["hand", 0.0087191451481596], ["general", 0.008681978894950218], ["room", 0.007882950579446693], ["eyes", 0.0058006945122443835], ["kitty", 0.0058006945122443835], ["good", 0.005501168099682105], ["haley", 0.001497632062811393]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHush!\u201d hissed Hope, and the General stepped from the darkness of the hallway.\n\u201cKitty\u2019s run off with Roy, and these two helped her,\u201d said Annie, livid. \u201cWhat\u2019ll we do?\u201d\nThe General breathed heavily, his eyes moving about the small room \u2014 from Annie to the ladder and luggage, to Haley and Hope. \u201cI\u2019ll see you two downstairs in the sunroom in fifteen minutes, on the dot,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d said Annie, and she followed the General down the hall.\nHaley could hear the General dialing, then shouting into the telephone. \u201cHe always yells into the telephone,\u201d said Hope.

Billy was preposterous\u2014six feet and three inches tall, with a chest and shoulders like a box of kitchen matches. He had no helmet, no overcoat, no weapon, and no boots. On his feet were cheap, low-cut civilian shoes which he had bought for his father\u2019s funeral. Billy had lost a heel, which made him bob up-and-down, up-and-down. The involuntary dancing, up-and-down, up-and-down, made his hip joints sore.\nBilly was wearing a thin field jacket, a shirt and trousers of scratchy wool, and long underwear that was soaked with sweat. He was the only one of the four who had a beard. It was a random, bristly beard, and some of the bristles were white, even though Billy was only twenty-one years old. He was also going bald. Wind and cold and violent exercise had turned his face crimson.\nHe didn\u2019t look like a soldier at all. He looked like a filthy flamingo.\nAnd on the third day of wandering, somebody shot at the four from far away\u2014shot four times as they crossed a narrow brick road. One shot was for the scouts. The next one was for the antitank gunner, whose name was Roland Weary.\nThe third bullet was for the filthy flamingo, who stopped dead center in the road when the lethal bee buzzed past his ear. Billy stood there politely, giving the marksman another chance. It was his addled understanding of the rules of warfare that the marksman should be given a second chance. The next shot missed Billy\u2019s kneecaps by inches, going end-on-end, from the sound of it.\nRoland Weary and the scouts were safe in a ditch, and Weary growled at Billy, \u201cGet out of the road, you dumb motherfucker.\u201d The last word was still a novelty in the speech of white people in 1944. It was fresh and astonishing to Billy, who had never fucked anybody\u2014and it did its job. It woke him up and got him off the road.\n\u201cSaved your life again, you dumb bastard,\u201d Weary said to Billy in the ditch. He had been saving Billy\u2019s life for days, cursing him, kicking him, slapping him, making him move. It was absolutely necessary that cruelty be used, because Billy wouldn\u2019t do anything to save himself. Billy wanted to quit. He was cold, hungry, embarrassed, incompetent. He could scarcely distinguish between sleep and wakefulness now, on the third day, found no important differences, either, between walking and standing still.\nHe wished everybody would leave him alone. \u201cYou guys go on without me,\u201d he said again and again.\nWeary was as new to war as Billy. He was a replacement, too. As a part of a gun crew, he had helped to fire one shot in anger\u2014from a 57-millimeter antitank gun. The gun made a ripping sound like the opening of the zipper on the fly of God Almighty. The gun lapped up snow and vegetation with a blowtorch thirty feet long. The flame left a black arrow on the ground, showing the Germans exactly where the gun was hidden. The shot was a miss.\nWhat had been missed was a Tiger tank. It swiveled its 88-millimeter snout around sniffingly, saw the arrow on the ground. It fired. It killed everybody on the gun crew but Weary.

He even said that maybe they should sell it, since it didn\u2019t look like they were going to do much camping anymore. So Mary didn\u2019t have to hire a nurse to watch over Roy while she worked. Retired people in the neighborhood were glad to pick up a few dollars, keeping him company and making sure he didn\u2019t hurt himself in some way.\nHe was certainly no trouble to them. He watched a lot of television and enjoyed playing for hours, never leaving the yard, with Donald, the golden retriever who had died, supposedly, on Bikini Atoll.\nAs Mary delivered what was to be her last lecture about the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, though, she would be stopped in mid-sentence for five seconds by a doubt which, if expressed in words, might have come out something like this: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just a crazy lady who has wandered off the street and into this classroom and started explaining the mysteries of life to these young people.

I don\u2019t remember being hit, but only the approach of a white German tank and German soldiers all in white across a snow-covered meadow in Luxembourg. I was unconscious when I was taken prisoner, and was kept that way by morphine until I woke up in a German military hospital in a church across the border, in Germany. She was right: I had to endure no more pain in the war than a civilian experiences in a dentist\u2019s chair.\nThe wound healed so quickly that I was soon shipped off to a camp as just another unremarkable prisoner.\nStill, I insisted that I was as entitled to a Survivor\u2019s Syndrome as my father, so she asked me two questions. The first one was this: \u201cDo you believe sometimes that you are a good person in a world where almost all of the other good people are dead?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.\n\u201cDo you sometimes believe that you must be wicked, since all the good people are dead, and that the only way to clear your name is to be dead, too?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou may be entitled to the Survivor\u2019s Syndrome, but you didn\u2019t get it,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you like to try for tuberculosis instead?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know so much about the Survivor\u2019s Syndrome?\u201d I asked her. This wasn\u2019t a boorish question to ask her, since she had told me during our first meeting on the beach that she and her husband, although both Jewish, had had no knowledge of relatives they might have had in Europe and who might have been killed during the Holocaust. They were both from families which had been in the United States for several generations, and which had lost all contact with European relatives.\n\u201cI wrote a book about it,\u201d she said. \u201cRather\u2014I wrote about people like you: children of a parent who had survived some sort of mass killing.

We lost that war, by the way. Order couldn\u2019t be restored in Indochina until the people kicked us out.\nThat war only made billionaires out of millionaires. Today\u2019s war is making trillionaires out of billionaires. Now I call that progress.\nAnd how come the people in countries we invade can\u2019t fight like ladies and gentlemen, in uniform and with tanks and helicopter gunships?\nBack to music. It makes practically everybody fonder of life than he or she would be without it. Even military bands, although I am a pacifist, always cheer me up. And I really like Strauss and Mozart and all that, but the priceless gift that African Americans gave the whole world when they were still in slavery was a gift so great that it is now almost the only reason many foreigners still like us at least a little bit. That specific remedy for the worldwide epidemic of depression is a gift called the blues. All pop music today\u2014jazz, swing, be-bop, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Stones, rock-and-roll, hip-hop, and on and on\u2014is derived from the blues.\nA gift to the world? One of the best rhythm-and-blues combos I ever heard was three guys and a girl from Finland playing in a club in Krakow, Poland.\nThe wonderful writer Albert Murray, who is a jazz historian and a friend of mine among other things, told me that during the era of slavery in this country\u2014an atrocity from which we can never fully recover\u2014the suicide rate per capita among slave owners was much higher than the suicide rate among slaves.\nMurray says he thinks this was because slaves had a way of dealing with depression, which their white owners did not: They could shoo away Old Man Suicide by playing and singing the Blues. He says something else which also sounds right to me. He says the blues can\u2019t drive depression clear out of a house, but can drive it into the corners of any room where it\u2019s being played.

\u201cWhat I want to know is what is the Government going to do about this?\u201d he said. \u201cAt the current death rate, this company will be out of business in eight months! I presume the same is true of every life insurance company. What is the Government going to do?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you suggest the Government do?\u201d said Dr. Everett. \u201cWe\u2019re quite open to suggestion\u2014almost pathetically so.\u201d\n\u201cAll right!\u201d said Millikan. \u201cGovernment action number one!\u201d\n\u201cNumber one!\u201d echoed Dr. Everett, preparing to write.\n\u201cGet this disease out in the open, where we can fight it! No more secrecy!\u201d said Millikan.\n\u201cMarvellous!\u201d said Dr. Everett. \u201cCall the reporters at once. We\u2019ll hold a press conference right here, give out all the facts and figures\u2014and within minutes the whole world will know.\u201d He turned to the old chairman of the board. \u201cModern communications are wonderful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost as wonderful as life insurance.\u201d He reached for the telephone on the long table, took it from its cradle. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the afternoon paper?\u201d he said.\nMillikan took the telephone away from him, hung up.\nEverett smiled at him in mock surprise. \u201cI thought that was step number one. I was just going to take it, so we could get right on to step two.\u201d\nMillikan closed his eyes, massaged the bridge of his nose. The young president of American Reliable and Equitable had plenty to contemplate within the violet privacy of his eyelids. After step one, which would inevitably publicize the bad condition of the insurance companies, there would be the worst financial collapse in the country\u2019s history. As for curing the epizootic: publicity could only make the disease kill more quickly, would make it cram into a few weeks of panic deaths that would ordinarily be spread over a few queasy years. As for the grander issues, as for America\u2019s becoming weak and contemptible, as for money\u2019s being valued more highly than life itself, Millikan hardly cared. What mattered to him most was immediate and personal. All other implications of the epizootic paled beside the garish, blaring fact that the company was about to go under, taking Millikan\u2019s brilliant career with it.\nThe telephone on the table rang. Breed answered, received information without comment, hung up. \u201cTwo more planes just crashed,\u201d he said. \u201cOne in Georgia\u2014fifty-three aboard.

troubles in droves.\nIt was the toilet in the foul little office lavatory that seemed to be having all the bad dreams. It sighed, it sobbed, it gurgled that it was drowning. Canned goods and tax forms and National Geographics were piled on the toilet tank. A bowl and a spoon were soaking in cold water in the washbasin. The medicine cabinet over the basin was wide open. It was crammed with vitamins and headache remedies and hemorrhoid salves and laxatives and sedatives. Eliot used them all regularly, but they weren't for him alone. They were for all the vaguely ill people who came to see him.\nLove and understanding and a little money were not enough for those people. They wanted medicine besides.\nPapers were stacked everywhere\u2014tax forms, Veteran's Administration forms, pension forms, relief forms, Social Security forms, parole forms. Stacks had toppled here and there, forming dunes. And between the stacks and dunes lay paper cups and empty cans of Ambrosia and cigarette butts and empty bottles of Southern Comfort.\nThumbtacked to the walls were pictures Eliot had clipped from Life and Look, pictures that now rustled in a light cool breeze running before a thunderstorm. Eliot found that certain pictures cheered people up, particularly pictures of baby animals. His visitors also enjoyed pictures of spectacular accidents. Astronauts bored them. They liked pictures of Elizabeth Taylor because they hated her so much, felt very superior to her. Their favorite person was Abraham Lincoln. Eliot tried to popularize Thomas Jefferson and Socrates, too, but people couldn't remember from one visit to the next who they were. \"Which one is which?\" they'd say.\nThe office had once belonged to a dentist. There was no clue of this previous occupancy save for the staircase leading up from the street. The dentist had nailed tin signs to the risers, each sign praising some aspect of his services. The signs were still there, but Eliot had painted out the messages. He had written a new one, a poem by William Blake. This was it, as broken up so as to fit twelve risers:\nThe Angel that presided o'er my birth said,\n\"Little creature, form'd of Joy & Mirth,", 0.0531031356031356], "title": "God Bless You, Mr.

So did an even more forgotten man, Celestino Madeiros (1894\u20141927), who confessed to the crime of which Sacco and Vanzetti had been convicted, even while his own conviction for another murder was being appealed. Madeiros was a notorious criminal, who behaved unselfishly at the end.\n1\nLIFE GOES ON, yes\u2014and a fool and his self-respect are soon parted, perhaps never to be reunited even on Judgment Day.\nPay attention, please, for years as well as people are characters in this book, which is the story of my life so far. Nineteen-hundred and Twenty-nine wrecked the American economy. Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-one sent me to Harvard. Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-eight got me my first job in the federal government. Nineteen-hundred and Forty-six gave me a wife. Nineteen-hundred and Forty-six gave me an ungrateful son. Nineteen-hundred and Fifty-three fired me from the federal government.\nThus do I capitalize years as though they were proper names.\nNineteen-hundred and Seventy gave me a job in the Nixon White House. Nineteen-hundred and Seventy-five sent me to prison for my own preposterous contributions to the American political scandals known collectively as \u201cWatergate.\u201d\nThree years ago, as I write, Nineteen-hundred and Seventy-seven was about to turn me loose again. I felt like a piece of garbage. I was wearing olive-drab coveralls, the prison uniform. I sat alone in a dormitory\u2014on a cot that I had stripped of its bedding. A blanket, two sheets, and a pillowcase, which were to be returned to my government along with my uniform, were folded neatly on my lap. My speckled old hands were clasped atop these. I stared straight ahead at a wall on the second floor of a barracks at the Federal Minimum Security Adult Correctional Facility on the edge of Finletter Air Force Base\u2014thirty-five miles from Atlanta, Georgia. I was waiting for a guard to conduct me to the Administration Building, where I would be given my release papers and my civilian clothes. There would be no one to greet me at the gate.

Fuzz had assumed that he would be sent a dispirited and drab woman, an unimaginative drudge who could be glumly content with a fubar supervisor in fubar surroundings. He had not taken into account the Personnel Department\u2019s card machines, to whom a girl was simply a girl.\n\u201cCome in\u2014come in,\u201d said Fuzz emptily.\nFrancine entered the miserable little office, still smiling, vibrant with optimism and good health. She had obviously just joined the company, for she carried all the pamphlets that new employees were given on their first day.", 0.09475108225108224], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["shirley", 0.10297589292642995], ["kern", 0.06865059528428664], ["list", 0.060990709920005375], ["jungle", 0.05465553428214511], ["managed", 0.048148201495317206], ["music", 0.04573260107507981], ["school", 0.043962040348709666], ["high", 0.043962040348709666], ["women", 0.04224874967137367], ["honor", 0.040660473280003585], ["wouldn", 0.03616364652898128], ["datum", 0.03432529764214332], ["touchdown", 0.03432529764214332], ["conquest", 0.03432529764214332], ["memories", 0.03432529764214332], ["imitating", 0.03432529764214332], ["excluding", 0.03432529764214332], ["teenager", 0.03432529764214332], ["enigmatic", 0.03432529764214332], ["turnip", 0.03432529764214332], ["occurs", 0.03432529764214332], ["receive", 0.03432529764214332], ["brag", 0.03432529764214332], ["nonparticipation", 0.03432529764214332], ["clarity", 0.03432529764214332], ["partly", 0.03432529764214332], ["prosthesis", 0.03432529764214332], ["omelet", 0.03432529764214332], ["glamorous", 0.03432529764214332], ["trusting", 0.03432529764214332], ["slit", 0.03432529764214332], ["frantic", 0.03432529764214332], ["slip", 0.03432529764214332], ["bandstand", 0.03432529764214332], ["injured", 0.03432529764214332], ["hope", 0.033330993727091966], ["desperate", 0.029910347447493987], ["spirits", 0.029910347447493987], ["fault", 0.029910347447493987], ["loving", 0.029910347447493987], ["extracurricular", 0.029910347447493987], ["smoking", 0.029910347447493987], ["football", 0.029910347447493987], ["sponsored", 0.029910347447493987], ["average", 0.029910347447493987], ["yellow", 0.027327767141072556], ["pitiful", 0.027327767141072556], ["honors", 0.027327767141072556], ["fantasy", 0.027327767141072556], ["sports", 0.027327767141072556], ["roll", 0.027327767141072556], ["anytime", 0.027327767141072556], ["aids", 0.02549539725284465], ["purple", 0.02549539725284465], ["laid", 0.02549539725284465], ["image", 0.02549539725284465], ["impossible", 0.02549539725284465], ["scared", 0.02549539725284465], ["activities", 0.02549539725284465], ["marijuana", 0.02549539725284465], ["43", 0.02549539725284465], ["michigan", 0.024074100747658603], ["tuberculosis", 0.024074100747658603], ["turns", 0.024074100747658603], ["laughing", 0.024074100747658603], ["grade", 0.024074100747658603], ["memory", 0.024074100747658603], ["epitaph", 0.024074100747658603], ["ruined", 0.024074100747658603], ["love", 0.02335953717614124], ["tb", 0.022912816946423224], ["merchants", 0.022912816946423224], ["prostitutes", 0.022912816946423224], ["mad", 0.022912816946423224], ["girls", 0.022912816946423224], ["blood", 0.022912816946423224], ["tombstone", 0.022912816946423224], ["will", 0.022651640983086325], ["names", 0.021930965482555336], ["mere", 0.021930965482555336], ["separate", 0.021930965482555336], ["sex", 0.02108044705819532], ["eye", 0.02108044705819532], ["responsible", 0.02108044705819532], ["soul", 0.020330236640001793], ["early", 0.01965915055300927], ["society", 0.01965915055300927], ["graduation", 0.01965915055300927], ["begun", 0.01965915055300927], ["dream", 0.01965915055300927], ["sorts", 0.019052079344064526], ["grown", 0.019052079344064526], ["god", 0.01798804058824818], ["loved", 0.01798804058824818], ["20", 0.017516015287906], ["government", 0.017516015287906], ["late", 0.01707657024658784], ["problem", 0.01707657024658784], ["lives", 0.016665496863545983], ["number", 0.016279352775543217], ["nice", 0.016279352775543217], ["university", 0.01591528644535246], ["planet", 0.01591528644535246], ["believed", 0.01591528644535246], ["death", 0.015570909239809302], ["guess", 0.01463712914941519], ["fact", 0.01463712914941519], ["better", 0.014353996903741091], ["4", 0.014353996903741091], ["national", 0.013332706138931031], ["free", 0.01310106509325667], ["find", 0.012877553502102082], ["student", 0.012877553502102082], ["life", 0.01282859993812254], ["years", 0.012670351275720537], ["rest", 0.012661620051938507], ["remember", 0.012452767677269775], ["making", 0.011864402580893883], ["family", 0.011500336250703127], ["woman", 0.011325820491543162], ["full", 0.01115595904515997], ["wife", 0.01051848478683524], ["sort", 0.010368609007152474], ["work", 0.009939046709091758], ["father", 0.009158140198949513], ["good", 0.009158140198949513], ["thing", 0.008686114898607336], ["black", 0.007835596474247319], ["asked", 0.0071744703998419465], ["prison", 0.0060281558810585], ["time", 0.004682238086999857], ["people", 0.004328289990472399]], "sentiment": ["What a planet.\nSO FATHER, HIS injured eye looking like a slit in a purple and yellow omelet, asked me if I was likely to receive any sort of honors at high school graduation. He didn\u2019t say so, but he was frantic for something to brag about at work. He was so desperate that he was trying to get blood out of the turnip of my nonparticipation in high school sports, student government, or school-sponsored extracurricular activities. My grade average was high enough to get me into the University of Michigan, and on the honor roll now and then, but not into the National Honor Society.\nIt was so pitiful! It made me mad, too, because he was trying to make me partly responsible for the family\u2019s image problem, which was all his fault. \u201cI was always sorry you didn\u2019t go out for football,\u201d he said, as though a touchdown would have made everything all right again.\n\u201cToo late now,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou let those 4 years slip by without doing anything but making jungle music,\u201d he said.\nIt occurs to me now, a mere 43 years later, that I might have said to him that at least I managed my sex life better than he had managed his. I was getting laid all the time, thanks to jungle music, and so were the other Soul Merchants. Certain sorts of not just girls but full-grown women, too, found us glamorous free spirits up on the bandstand, imitating black people and smoking marijuana, and loving ourselves when we made music, and laughing about God knows what just about anytime.\nI GUESS MY love life is over now. Even if I could get out of prison, I wouldn\u2019t want to give some trusting woman tuberculosis. She would be scared to death of getting AIDS, and I would give her TB instead. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice?\nSo now I will have to make do with memories. As a prosthesis for my memory, I have begun to list all the women, excluding my wife and prostitutes, with whom I have \u201cgone all the way,\u201d as we used to say in high school. I find it impossible to remember any conquest I made as a teenager with clarity, to separate fact from fantasy. It was all a dream. So I begin my list with Shirley Kern, to whom I made love when I was 20. Shirley is my datum.\nHow many names will there be on the list? Too early to tell, but wouldn\u2019t that number, whatever it turns out to be, be as good a thing as any to put on my tombstone as an enigmatic epitaph?\nI AM CERTAINLY sorry if I ruined the lives of any of those women who believed me when I said I loved them. I can only hope against hope that Shirley Kern and all the rest of them are still OK.", 0.07796296296296296], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["capricorn",

standing on nothing, shimmering like northern lights\u2014beautiful, curving off in space, all around the earth like a glowing fog. I can see them, do you hear? I can see them now. I can see Margaret. She\u2019s waving and smiling, misty, heavenly, beautiful. If only you could see it, if\u2014\u201d\nThe radio operator flicked on the jamming signal. There was a footfall in the hallway.\nGeneral Dane stalked into the radio room, studying his watch. \u201cIn five minutes they\u2019ll start him down,\u201d he said. He plunged his hands deep into his pockets and slouched dejectedly. \u201cWe failed this time. Next time, by God, we\u2019ll make it. The next man who goes up will know what he\u2019s up against\u2014he\u2019ll be ready to take it.\u201d\nHe put his hand on Groszinger\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe most important job you\u2019ll ever have to do, my friend, is to keep your mouth shut about those spirits out there, do you understand? We don\u2019t want the enemy to know we\u2019ve had a ship out there, and we don\u2019t want them to know what they\u2019ll come across if they try it. The security of this country depends on that being our secret. Do I make myself clear?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Groszinger, grateful to have no choice but to be quiet. He didn\u2019t want to be the one to tell the world. He wished he had had nothing to do with sending Rice out into space. What discovery of the dead would do to humanity he didn\u2019t know, but the impact would be terrific. Now, like the rest, he would have to wait for the next wild twist of history.\nThe General looked at his watch again. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing him down,\u201d he said.\nAt 1:39 p.m., on Friday, July 28th, the British liner Capricorn, two hundred eighty miles out of New York City, bound for Liverpool, radioed that an unidentified object had crashed into the sea, sending up a towering geyser on the horizon to starboard of the ship. Several passengers were said to have seen something glinting as the thing fell from the sky. Upon reaching the scene of the crash, the Capricorn reported finding dead and stunned fish on the surface, and turbulent water, but no wreckage.\nNewspapers suggested that the Capricorn had seen the crash of an experimental rocket fired out to sea in a test of range. The Secretary of Defense promptly denied that any such tests were being conducted over the Atlantic.\nIn Boston, Dr. Bernard Groszinger, young rocket consultant for the Air Force, told newsmen that what the Capricorn had observed might well have been a meteor.\n\u201cThat seems quite likely,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was a meteor, the fact that it reached the earth\u2019s surface should, I think, be one of the year\u2019s most important science news stories. Usually meteors burn to nothing before they\u2019re even through the stratosphere.\u201d", 0.07099529780564265], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["chinaman", 0.13085292508582289], ["barry", 0.12198931072537654], ["fred", 0.11948969609038913], ["rosewater", 0.06365173854792217], ["letter", 0.06365173854792217], ["older", 0.05963410385565195], ["happier", 0.05963410385565195], ["english", 0.055524359963483656], ["fabulously", 0.052336594944709235], ["greatest", 0.049732001276224166], ["eliot", 0.04752984870726333], ["festival", 0.04401693715061885], ["honorarium", 0.03766428256116962], ["assures", 0.03766428256116962], ["joyfully", 0.03766428256116962], ["grew", 0.03766428256116962], ["wealthiest", 0.03766428256116962], ["praise", 0.03766428256116962], ["confessed", 0.03766428256116962], ["ecstatic", 0.03766428256116962], ["focal", 0.03766428256116962], ["living", 0.03485408877867901], ["mistook", 0.03271323127145572], ["clipped", 0.03271323127145572], ["dressing", 0.03271323127145572], ["borrow", 0.03271323127145572], ["rising", 0.03271323127145572], ["harvest", 0.03271323127145572], ["greco", 0.03271323127145572], ["expenses", 0.03271323127145572], ["sphere", 0.03271323127145572], ["recommended", 0.03271323127145572], ["higher", 0.03271323127145572], ["real", 0.032532389785853655], ["dollars", 0.031835387440576055], ["valuable", 0.029817051927825976], ["translucent", 0.029817051927825976], ["el", 0.029817051927825976], ["highly", 0.029817051927825976], ["illuminated", 0.029817051927825976], ["chinamen", 0.029817051927825976], ["hire", 0.029817051927825976], ["check", 0.029817051927825976], ["speaker", 0.029817051927825976], ["resembled", 0.029817051927825976], ["stilts", 0.029817051927825976], ["condition", 0.027762179981741828], ["travel", 0.027762179981741828], ["arts", 0.027725643548407758], ["invited", 0.026168297472354617], ["explained", 0.026168297472354617], ["afford", 0.026168297472354617], ["alike", 0.026168297472354617], ["moon", 0.024866000638112083], ["fell", 0.024866000638112083], ["buy", 0.024866000638112083], ["birthday", 0.024866000638112083], ["hair", 0.023764924353631665], ["novelist", 0.023764924353631665], ["stock", 0.023764924353631665], ["pure", 0.023764924353631665], ["rich", 0.023764924353631665], ["painting", 0.023764924353631665], ["writer", 0.022811128692027935], ["language", 0.022811128692027935], ["oil", 0.022811128692027935], ["windows", 0.022811128692027935], ["worth", 0.02196982129448234], ["happened", 0.02121724618264072], ["works", 0.02121724618264072], ["exactly", 0.02121724618264072], ["mildred", 0.02121724618264072], ["chairman", 0.02121724618264072], ["late", 0.0205364591840384], ["suddenly", 0.0205364591840384], ["paid", 0.0205364591840384], ["age", 0.0205364591840384], ["trout", 0.019171468220330404], ["american", 0.018321066839010976], ["center", 0.018321066839010976], ["point", 0.017860077402314038], ["began", 0.017860077402314038], ["picture", 0.017860077402314038], ["owned", 0.017427044389339504], ["incidentally", 0.01701877000476844], ["inside", 0.015917693720288027], ["mother", 0.014963898058684293], ["looked", 0.014036287391647938], ["money", 0.013862821774203879], ["kilgore", 0.013650163500391947], ["midland", 0.013650163500391947], ["person", 0.013612169489837664], ["man", 0.013460945975391653], ["read", 0.01337001554929708], ["night", 0.012909026112600145], ["couldn", 0.012909026112600145], ["three", 0.012689228550694761], ["city", 0.012375433018564195], ["wanted", 0.010473836205667336], ["lot", 0.010163228263240629], ["white", 0.009040474095223398]], "sentiment": ["The letter did not say so, but Mildred Barry was the late mother of the Chairman, the wealthiest man in Midland City. Fred T. Barry had paid for the new Center of the Arts, which was a translucent sphere on stilts. It had no windows. When illuminated inside at night, it resembled a rising harvest moon.\nFred T. Barry, incidentally, was exactly the same age as Trout. They had the same birthday. But they certainly didn\u2019t look anything alike. Fred T. Barry didn\u2019t even look like a white man anymore, even though he was of pure English stock. As he grew older and older and happier and happier, and all his hair fell out everywhere, he came to look like an ecstatic old Chinaman.\nHe looked so much like a Chinaman that he had taken to dressing like a Chinaman. Real Chinamen often mistook him for a real Chinaman.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFred T. Barry confessed in his letter that he had not read the works of Kilgore Trout, but that he would joyfully do so before the Festival began. \u201cYou come highly recommended by Eliot Rosewater,\u201d he said, \u201cwho assures me that you are perhaps the greatest living American novelist. There can be no higher praise than that.\u201d\nClipped to the letter was a check for one thousand dollars. Fred T. Barry explained that this was for travel expenses and an honorarium.\nIt was a lot of money. Trout was suddenly fabulously well-to-do.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHere is how Trout happened to be invited: Fred T. Barry wanted to have a fabulously valuable oil painting as a focal point for the Midland City Festival of the Arts. As rich as he was, he couldn\u2019t afford to buy one, so he looked for one to borrow.\nThe first person he went to was Eliot Rosewater, who owned an El Greco worth three million dollars or more.
