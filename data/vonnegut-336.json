Here she thought she\u2019d been making Hal feel better, and she\u2019d been making him feel worse instead.\n\u201cWhat do you think I think when I see Bea Muller or Nancy Gossett downtown in their fur coats, buying out the department stores?\u201d Hal said. \u201cI think about you, stuck in this house. I think, Well, for crying out loud, I used to be president of their husbands\u2019 fraternity house! For crying out loud, me and Harve Muller and George Gossett used to be the Grand Triumvirate. That\u2019s what they used to call the three of us in college\u2014the Grand Triumvirate! We used to run the college, and I\u2019m not kidding. We founded the Owl\u2019s Club, and I was president.\n\u201cLook where they live, and look where we live,\u201d Hal went on. \u201cWe oughta be right out there with \u2019em at Fifty-seventh and North Meridian! We oughta have a cottage right next to \u2019em at Lake Maxinkuckee! Least I can do is get my wife a cook.\u201d\nElla Rice arrived at the house the next day at three o\u2019clock as planned. In a paper bag she had the turban Hal had given her. Hal wasn\u2019t home yet. Ella was supposed to pretend to be the new cook instead of a jinni until Hal arrived at three-thirty. Which she did.\nWhat Hal hadn\u2019t counted on, though, was that Mary would find Ella so likable, but so pitiful, not a cook, but a fellow human being in awful trouble. He had expected them to go to the kitchen to talk about this and that, what Hal liked to eat, and so on. But Mary asked Ella about her pregnancy, which was obvious. Ella, who was no actress, and at the end of her rope in any case, burst into tears. The two women, one white, one black, stayed in the living room and talked about their lives instead.\nElla wasn\u2019t married. The father of her child had beaten her up when he found out she was pregnant, and then taken off for parts unknown. She had aches and pains in many places, and no relatives, and didn\u2019t know how much longer she could do housework. She repeated what she had told Hal, that her pregnancy still had six weeks to go, she thought. Mary said she wished she could have a baby, but couldn\u2019t. That didn\u2019t help.\nWhen Hal parked the new Marmon out front and entered the house, neither woman was in any condition to enjoy the show he had planned. They were a mess! But he imagined his magic lamp would cheer them up. He went to get it from the closet where he had hidden it upstairs, then brought it into the living room and said, \u201cMy goodness! Look what I just found. I do believe it\u2019s a magic lamp. Maybe if I rub it a jinni will appear, and she will make a wish come true.\u201d He hadn\u2019t considered hiring a black man to play the jinni. He was scared of black men.\nElla Rice recognized her cue, and got off the couch to do the crazy thing the white man was going to pay for. Anything for money. It hurt her a lot to stand, after sitting still for a half-hour. Even Hal could see that.\nHal wished for a Marmon, and the jinni said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d The three went out to the car, and Hal told them to get in, that it was his, paid for in full. The women sat in the backseat, and Mary said to Ella, not to Hal, \u201cThanks a lot. This is wonderful. I think I\u2019m going nuts.\u201d\nHal drove up North Meridian Street, pointing out grand houses left and right. Every time he did that, Mary said that she wouldn\u2019t want it, that Hal could throw his magic lamp out the window, as far as she was concerned. What she was really upset about was the humiliating use he was making of her new friend Ella.", 0.11938074945887445], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["lou", 0.13214486300897477], ["remember", 0.08497478228278833], ["mars", 0.0765997628894541], ["em", 0.07198945099593929], ["seaweed", 0.07059287239896278], ["sawdust", 0.07059287239896278], ["stars", 0.05431713478906486], ["twelve", 0.05275623826080076], ["stove", 0.04343430500443035], ["colonist", 0.04343430500443035], ["pops", 0.04343430500443035], ["hmmm", 0.04343430500443035], ["whiz", 0.04343430500443035], ["bunkers", 0.04343430500443035], ["ramp", 0.04343430500443035], ["emigrate", 0.04343430500443035], ["trillion", 0.04343430500443035], ["launching", 0.04343430500443035], ["flight", 0.04343430500443035], ["barrrrrroooom", 0.04343430500443035], ["empire", 0.03829988144472705], ["listlessly", 0.03829988144472705], ["doggedly", 0.03829988144472705], ["kindly", 0.03829988144472705], ["planet", 0.03829988144472705], ["lick", 0.03829988144472705], ["raw", 0.03829988144472705], ["turns", 0.03829988144472705], ["personnel", 0.03829988144472705], ["overpopulation", 0.03829988144472705], ["infinity", 0.03829988144472705], ["cheery", 0.03829988144472705], ["bing", 0.03829988144472705], ["bugs", 0.03829988144472705], ["stores", 0.03529643619948139], ["velvet", 0.03529643619948139], ["technical", 0.03529643619948139], ["support", 0.03529643619948139], ["remain", 0.03529643619948139], ["tastes", 0.03529643619948139], ["fiercely", 0.03529643619948139], ["shopping", 0.03529643619948139], ["materials", 0.03529643619948139], ["gee", 0.03316545788502376], ["seventeen", 0.03316545788502376], ["fiction", 0.03316545788502376], ["depressed", 0.03316545788502376], ["speedway", 0.03316545788502376], ["shooting", 0.03316545788502376], ["bucks", 0.03316545788502376], ["billion", 0.03316545788502376], ["processed", 0.03151254269010369], ["situation", 0.03151254269010369], ["bright", 0.030162012639778094], ["chairs", 0.030162012639778094], ["lousy", 0.030162012639778094], ["golly", 0.02902015575216877], ["heads", 0.02902015575216877], ["balcony", 0.028031034325320454], ["folks", 0.02715856739453243], ["bought", 0.02715856739453243], ["size", 0.02715856739453243], ["edge", 0.02715856739453243], ["couple", 0.02637811913040038], ["plain", 0.02637811913040038], ["fight", 0.02637811913040038], ["eat", 0.02637811913040038], ["science", 0.02637811913040038], ["mile", 0.025672117798516494], ["space", 0.025672117798516494], ["race", 0.025672117798516494], ["seconds", 0.025672117798516494], ["leaving", 0.025672117798516494], ["stage", 0.025672117798516494], ["buy", 0.025672117798516494], ["worry", 0.025672117798516494], ["clean", 0.025672117798516494], ["realize", 0.025027589080074793], ["die", 0.025027589080074793], ["stuff", 0.025027589080074793], ["state", 0.024434680134344893], ["main", 0.022896610765617158], ["dog", 0.022896610765617158], ["board", 0.02244753949290282], ["sighed", 0.02244753949290282], ["start", 0.02202414383482913], ["building", 0.021623645899493754], ["kid", 0.021623645899493754], ["cold", 0.021243695570697083], ["wait", 0.021243695570697083], ["wonderful", 0.021243695570697083], ["shrugged", 0.02088228694721981], ["bed", 0.020537694238813194], ["earth", 0.020208421923473687], ["fine", 0.020208421923473687], ["felt", 0.020208421923473687], ["thing", 0.02020476304100492], ["closed", 0.019893165520371493], ["walked", 0.01875130863276217], ["black", 0.017762187205913858], ["side", 0.017534248993567533], ["ten", 0.01688972027512583], ["nice", 0.01688972027512583], ["wouldn", 0.016489222339790457], ["lot", 0.01629681132939593], ["guess", 0.015573563406700259], ["wanted", 0.01445635681607371], ["better", 0.013750355484189824], ["three", 0.013105826765748124], ["years", 0.01298338749203545], ["find", 0.012512917820018222], ["life", 0.012512917820018222], ["wife", 0.012070553118524724], ["wasn", 0.011653123958886711], ["eyes", 0.010882829784634507], ["people", 0.009321933256370412], ["looked", 0.009031409455234996], ["going", 0.008548896105820466]], "sentiment": ["Doggedly, Lou tried to find the cheery side of the situation. \"Well, anyway, they\u2019ve got the stuff so it tastes a lot less like seaweed and sawdust than it did at first; and they say it\u2019s actually better for us than what we used to eat.\"\n\"I felt fine!\" said Em fiercely.\nLou shrugged. \"Well, you\u2019ve got to realize, the world wouldn\u2019t be able to support twelve billion people if it wasn\u2019t for processed seaweed and sawdust.
