["That\u2019s what it was doing when Zoltan was smacked by a runaway fire truck. The driver of the truck hadn\u2019t realized yet that it was up to him to steer the thing.\nAs Trout wrote in My Ten Years on Automatic Pilot: \u201cIt was free will that did all the damage. The timequake and its aftershocks didn\u2019t snap as much as a single strand in a spider\u2019s web, unless some other force had snapped that strand the first time through.\u201d\nMonica was working on the budget for Xanadu when the timequake struck. The endowment of that writers\u2019 retreat up in Point Zion, Rhode Island, the Julius King Bowen Foundation, was administered by the Academy. Julius King Bowen, who died before Monica was born, was a never-married white man who made a fortune during the 1920s and early 1930s with stories and lectures about the hilarious, but touching, too, efforts by American black people to imitate successful American white people, so they could be successful, too.\nA cast-iron historical marker on the border between Point Zion\u2019s public beach and Xanadu said the mansion had been Bowen\u2019s home and place of work from 1922 until his death in 1936. It said President Warren G. Harding had proclaimed Bowen \u201cLaughter Laureate of the United States, Master of Darky Dialects, and Heir to the Crown of King of Humor Once Worn by Mark Twain.\u201d\nAs Trout would point out to me when I read that marker in 2001: \u201cWarren G. Harding sired an illegitimate daughter by ejaculating in the birth canal of a stenographer in a broom closet at the White House.\u201d\n23\nWhen Trout was zapped back to a line outside a blood bank in San Diego, California, in 1991, he could remember how his story about the guy with his head between his legs and his ding-dong atop his neck, \u201cAlbert Hardy,\u201d would end. But he couldn\u2019t write that finale for ten years, until free will kicked in again. Albert Hardy would be blown to pieces while a soldier in the Second Battle of the Somme in World War One.\nAlbert Hardy\u2019s dogtags wouldn\u2019t be found. His body parts would be reassembled as though he had been like everybody else, with his head atop his neck. He couldn\u2019t be given back his ding-dong. To be perfectly frank, his ding-dong wouldn\u2019t have been what you might call the subject of an exhaustive search.\nAlbert Hardy would be buried under an Eternal Flame in France, in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, \u201cnormal at last.\u201d\nI myself was zapped back to this house near the tip of Long Island, New York, where I am writing now, halfway through the rerun. In 1991, as now, I was gazing at a list of all I\u2019d published, and wondering, \u201cHow the hell did I do that?\u201d", 0.1595813041125541], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["label", 0.2021941784688999], ["bottle", 0.17476161340397053], ["thee", 0.14669631941944816], ["sight", 0.12279469250358797], ["breadth", 0.10109708923444995], ["orchards", 0.10109708923444995], ["fringe", 0.10109708923444995], ["depth", 0.10109708923444995], ["nancy", 0.09407368826444647], ["book", 0.08984602198540052], ["grown", 0.08914627577651985], ["1968", 0.08914627577651985], ["ideal", 0.08215549805051703], ["tower", 0.08215549805051703], ["height", 0.07719546231858977], ["ends", 0.07719546231858977], ["fields", 0.07719546231858977], ["bell", 0.07334815970972408], ["nothinghead", 0.07020468459258694], ["reach", 0.07020468459258694], ["love", 0.06943046806510476], ["pills", 0.06754691425073765], ["city", 0.06754691425073765], ["count", 0.06754691425073765], ["monkey", 0.06524464886065967], ["belonged", 0.0632139068665841], ["raised", 0.06139734625179399], ["ways", 0.06139734625179399], ["lovely", 0.06139734625179399], ["soul", 0.06139734625179399], ["blind", 0.05975406728965046], ["woods", 0.05975406728965046], ["leaving", 0.05975406728965046], ["left", 0.057204777800245896], ["forever", 0.05687382445063035], ["children", 0.054406568525791156], ["month", 0.054406568525791156], ["feeling", 0.054406568525791156], ["top", 0.05224858330244622], ["grace", 0.051263093408654], ["billy", 0.0494465327938639], ["walk", 0.04427231568265117], ["school", 0.03931227995072391], ["small", 0.03838008648054675], ["house", 0.031089451121580652], ["long", 0.02993959983712078], ["door", 0.02736146649279382], ["eyes", 0.025330724498718246], ["will", 0.025330724498718246]], "sentiment": ["How do I love thee?

The one manly feat of strength of which I was capable was the mastery of a bucking gun. Instructed by my father and my brother on the range at the Rod and Gun Club, I had learned to knit together whatever strength and weight I had so as to absorb any shock a man-sized rifle or shotgun or pistol might wish to deal to me\u2014to absorb it with amusement and satisfaction, and to get ready to fire again and again.\nI was not only fingerprinted. I was faceprinted, too. The police pushed my hand and then my face into a shallow pan of gummy black ink.\nI was straightened up, and one of the policemen commented that I was a proper-looking nigger now. Until that moment, I had been willing to believe that policemen were my best friends and everybody\u2019s best friends.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI was about to be put on display to concerned members of the community\u2014in a holding pen for suspected criminals awaiting trial, in the basement of the old County Courthouse across the street. It was ten at night. It was still Mother\u2019s Day. The courthouse was empty. The upper floors would remain dark. Only the basement lights would be on.\nIt was the feeling of the police that I should not look good, and that I bear some marks of their displeasure with what I had done. But they couldn\u2019t beat me up, as they might have beaten up an adult offender, since that might evoke sympathy. So they had rolled my face in goo.\nAll this was in clear violation of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the United States.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo I was put in this large cage in the basement of the courthouse. It was rectangular, and made of heavy-duty mesh fencing and vertical iron pipes. It was open to observers on all four sides. It contained wooden benches for about thirty people, I would say. There were plenty of cuspidors, but no toilet. Any caged person having to go to the toilet had to say so, and then to be escorted to a nearby lavatory.\nI was unshackled.", 0.12177579365079368], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf":

Brothers Funeral Home in Pittsburgh. He became manager of the home within two years. A year after that, he married the widowed owner, Hattie Scharff. Hattie was fifty-eight at the time, and Jones was twenty-four. The many investigators into Jones\u2019 life, unfriendly investigators almost to a man, have been bound to conclude that Jones really loved his Hattie. The marriage, which endured until the death of Hattie in 1928, was a happy one.\nIn fact, it was so happy, so whole, so self-sufficient a nation of two that Jones did almost nothing during that time by way of alerting the Anglo-Saxons. He seems to have been content to confine his remarks on racial matters to workroom jests about certain cadavers, jests that would have seemed workaday in the most liberal of embalming establishments. And the years were golden, not only emotionally and financially, but creatively as well. Working with a chemist named Dr. Lomar Horthy, Jones developed Viverine, an embalming fluid, and Gingiva-Tru, a wonderfully life-like, gum-simulating substance for false teeth.\nWhen Jones\u2019 wife died, Jones felt the need to be reborn. He was reborn a thing he had been latently all along. Jones became the sort of racial agitator who is spoken of as having crawled out from under a rock. Jones crawled out from under his rock in 1928. He sold his funeral home for eighty-four thousand dollars, and he founded The White Christian Minuteman.\nJones was wiped out by the stock market crash in 1929. His paper suspended publication after fourteen issues. The fourteen issues had been mailed free to every person in Who\u2019s Who. The only illustrations were photographs and diagrams of teeth, and every article was an explanation of some current events in terms of Jones\u2019 theories about dentition and race.\nIn the next-to-the-last issue, Jones billed himself on the masthead as, \u201cDr. Lionel J. D. Jones, D.D.S.\u201d\nPenniless again, now forty years of age, Jones answered an ad in a funeral-home trade journal. An embalming school in Little Rock, Arkansas, needed a president. The ad was signed by the widow of the former president and owner.\nJones got the job, and the widow, too. The widow\u2019s name was Mary Alice Shoup. She was sixty-eight when Jones married her.\nAnd Jones again became a devoted husband, a happy, whole, and quiet man.\nThe school he headed was named, straightforwardly enough, The Little Rock School of Embalming. It was losing eight thousand dollars a year. Jones took it out of the high-overhead field of embalming education, sold its real estate, and had it rechartered as The Western Hemisphere University of the Bible. The university held no classes, taught nothing, did all its business by mail. Its business was the awarding of doctorates in the field of divinity, framed and under glass, for eighty dollars a throw.", 0.21685267857142856], "title": "Mother Night"},

"sentiment": ["Ash blew up again. \u201cWho ever told you a comedian is supposed to be funny?\u201d he said. \u201cThe great ones are heartbreakers, and that\u2019s what you did to me tonight. Who are you? What are you? Where did you park your flying saucer?\u201d\nAsh told the nurse to get him out of \u201cthis firetrap.\u201d His farewell to the flummoxed Berman? \u201cFuck you, fuck you, fuck you. Please take that as a compliment.\u201d\nThe material Berman had tried out that night, which would become a classic on Who\u2019s Sorry Now? and in his cabaret repertoire, was about the appalling conditions in New York City public schools in the poorer neighborhoods. It began, \u201cI know a lot of people think evolution shouldn\u2019t be taught in public schools. I have good news for them. Fuck evolution. There are some schools in New York City that don\u2019t even teach kids how to read and write. How do we do it? We pay the teachers less than garbagemen, make sure there\u2019s no money for books or to unclog the toilets, or to fix the leaks in the roof, and make sure there are forty kids in every smelly schoolroom. Makes you wonder who won the Civil War.\u201d\nBerman hadn\u2019t visited any of the awful schools. He read about them in the newspapers. And when a piece of a school building fell on a student and killed him or her, it would be on TV. That was all the research that he\u2014or anybody else, including the mayor\u2014had to do to find out how uninhabitable some of the public schools were.\nNow he ceased to be a baritone Jeremiah and became a falsetto female teacher: \u201cChildren, please stop sneezing and coughing and weeping, because I am going to tell you a secret that many powerful people wish I wouldn\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s called \u2018evolution.\u2019 It is about how the policy of winners mating with winners, starting with germs, has given us the giraffe and the hippopotamus.\u201d Berman here made a baritone aside: \u201cJust because I believe in evolution doesn\u2019t mean I have to approve of it.\u201d And then back he went to the falsetto life-sciences lecture, saying that a great scientist named Charles Darwin noticed how upper-class Englishpersons in his day always strove to marry winners instead of losers, and then realized that all animals must pair off that way. \u201cHey presto! Rattlesnakes and lightning bugs!\u201d\nAnd on and on. The police arrive and haul the whole class to the station house for questioning about teenage pregnancy and juvenile delinquency. The school\u2019s roof and ceiling crash down on the dilapidated chairs and desks, but the children are safe and sound down at the cop shop, \u201ceating free sandwiches made of salami and Wonder Bread.\u201d\nOne of the few old men in the Northampton audience on the night of December 11 in the year 2000 called out to Berman as the comedian was gathering his wits at the lectern onstage, before the comedian himself had said a thing: \u201cHey Gilbert! You gonna do the one about evolution?\u201d\nAgain about Gil Berman\u2019s so-called \u201cpretty face\u201d: His father, a ladies\u2019 man if there ever was one, had features that were similarly symmetrical and understated, somewhat dainty. He and his son were what a physical anthropologist would term \u201cpaedomorphs,\u201d not to be confused with \u201cpederasts.\u201d That meant they had pleasing features somewhat reminiscent of childhood. All women who are said to be beautiful are paedomorphs. The greatest of old-time comedians, Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin, had a pretty face, and yet he was neither a castrato nor an androgyne. The late Oliver Hardy had a pretty face. The late Oliver Hardy had rosebud lips!\nBerman said in response to the old geezer: \u201cPlease, no questions from the audience, and no autographs or interviews afterward.\u201d There came now, as a formal announcement, a bit he had done for Who\u2019s Sorry Now?

The creatures can see where each star has been and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled with rarefied, luminous spaghetti. And Tralfamadorians don\u2019t see human beings as two-legged creatures, either. They see them as great millepedes\u2014\u201dwith babies\u2019 legs at one end and old people\u2019s legs at the other,\u201d says Billy Pilgrim.\nBilly asked for something to read on the trip to Tralfamadore. His captors had five million Earthling books on microfilm, but no way to project them in Billy\u2019s cabin. They had only one actual book in English which would be placed in a Tralfamadorian museum. It was Valley of the Dolls, by Jacqueline Susann.\nBilly read it, thought it was pretty good in spots. The people in it certainly had their ups and downs, ups and downs. But Billy didn\u2019t want to read about the same ups and downs over and over again. He asked if there wasn\u2019t, please, some other reading matter around.\n\u201cOnly Tralfamadorian novels, which I\u2019m afraid you couldn\u2019t begin to understand,\u201d said the speaker on the wall.\n\u201cLet me look at one anyway.\u201d\nSo they sent him in several. They were little things. A dozen of them might have had the bulk of Valley of the Dolls\u2014with all its ups and downs, ups and downs.\nBilly couldn\u2019t read Tralfamadorian, of course, but he could at least see how the books were laid out\u2014in brief clumps of symbols separated by stars. Billy commented that the clumps might be telegrams.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said the voice.\n\u201cThey are telegrams?\u201d\n\u201cThere are no telegrams on Tralfamadore. But you\u2019re right: each clump of symbols is a brief, urgent message\u2014describing a situation, a scene. We Tralfamadorians read them all at once, not one after the other. There isn\u2019t any particular relationship between all the messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time.\u201d", 0.17317708333333334], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["trowbridge", 0.1322447262521682], ["firm", 0.09918354468912617], ["company", 0.09888632521142732], ["helicopter", 0.09008567991739047], ["national", 0.08695153562042127], ["visitor", 0.07471952655171635], ["wilburhampton", 0.06040899332436936], ["contract", 0.05796769041361418], ["bought", 0.055332250869337934], ["noel", 0.05391973249862847], ["florence", 0.05319751267116518], ["rich", 0.04165834498867429], ["alum", 0.03306118156304205], ["electra", 0.03306118156304205], ["higgins", 0.03306118156304205], ["postcard", 0.03306118156304205], ["hygiene", 0.03306118156304205], ["employees", 0.03306118156304205], ["trailer", 0.03306118156304205], ["mucilage", 0.03306118156304205], ["authority", 0.03306118156304205], ["strongest", 0.03306118156304205], ["norwich", 0.03306118156304205], ["richmond", 0.03306118156304205], ["electroplating", 0.03306118156304205], ["nitrate", 0.03306118156304205], ["helicopters", 0.03306118156304205], ["bakeries", 0.03306118156304205], ["vickery", 0.03306118156304205], ["stamps", 0.03306118156304205], ["fee", 0.03306118156304205], ["clough", 0.03306118156304205], ["anderson", 0.03306118156304205], ["creations", 0.03306118156304205], ["ballistic", 0.03306118156304205], ["outgrown", 0.03306118156304205], ["del", 0.03306118156304205], ["trader", 0.03306118156304205], ["duplicating", 0.03306118156304205], ["engineering", 0.03306118156304205], ["dredging", 0.03306118156304205], ["accounting", 0.03306118156304205], ["missiles", 0.03306118156304205], ["granada", 0.03306118156304205], ["intercontinental", 0.03306118156304205], ["trowbridges", 0.03306118156304205], ["mar", 0.03306118156304205], ["gelatin", 0.03306118156304205], ["conservatively", 0.03306118156304205], ["executive", 0.02898384520680709], ["chambermaid", 0.02898384520680709], ["term", 0.02898384520680709], ["elco", 0.02898384520680709], ["decision", 0.02898384520680709], ["electronics", 0.02898384520680709], ["exercise", 0.02898384520680709], ["eagle", 0.02898384520680709], ["august", 0.02898384520680709], ["whitehill", 0.02898384520680709], ["addressed", 0.02898384520680709], ["holdings", 0.02898384520680709], ["hoist", 0.02898384520680709], ["associates", 0.02898384520680709], ["contact", 0.02898384520680709], ["barrel", 0.02898384520680709], ["personal", 0.02659875633558259], ["program", 0.02659875633558259], ["gideon", 0.02659875633558259], ["doubled", 0.02659875633558259], ["relative", 0.02659875633558259], ["novelty", 0.02659875633558259], ["international", 0.02659875633558259], ["cent", 0.02659875633558259], ["card", 0.02659875633558259], ["granite", 0.02659875633558259], ["eternity", 0.02659875633558259], ["small", 0.025722513661552985], ["indiana", 0.024906508850572117], ["believed", 0.024906508850572117], ["lock", 0.024906508850572117], ["advice", 0.024906508850572117], ["regular", 0.024906508850572117], ["spacecraft", 0.023593899725194413], ["revenue", 0.023593899725194413], ["owned", 0.023593899725194413], ["internal", 0.023593899725194413], ["continued", 0.022521419979347618], ["bureau", 0.022521419979347618], ["change", 0.022521419979347618], ["months", 0.022521419979347618], ["flat", 0.022521419979347618], ["hotel", 0.022521419979347618], ["constant", 0.021012071694230812], ["contained", 0.020829172494337144], ["government", 0.020829172494337144], ["telling", 0.020829172494337144], ["oil", 0.020829172494337144], ["investment", 0.020829172494337144], ["buy", 0.020829172494337144], ["sell", 0.020829172494337144], ["interested", 0.02013633110812312], ["galactic", 0.02013633110812312], ["president", 0.02013633110812312], ["worth", 0.019516563368959437], ["picture", 0.019516563368959437], ["sold", 0.018955915252463408], ["suit", 0.018955915252463408], ["223", 0.018955915252463408], ["stock", 0.018955915252463408], ["third", 0.018955915252463408], ["spent", 0.018955915252463408], ["long", 0.018557054092736468], ["twelve", 0.018444083623112645], ["bible", 0.018444083623112645], ["easy", 0.018444083623112645], ["landed", 0.018444083623112645], ["pieces", 0.018444083623112645], ["brought", 0.01797324416620949], ["work", 0.01797324416620949], ["named", 0.017537314918246418], ["forty", 0.01713147449773494], ["written", 0.016395220715652553], ["dollars", 0.015152226047021924], ["twenty", 0.015152226047021924], ["iron", 0.014617097939929413], ["fifty", 0.014366747266877672], ["days", 0.014366747266877672], ["night", 0.013895907809974517], ["ten", 0.013054138141499968], ["room", 0.013054138141499968], ["piece", 0.013054138141499968], ["big", 0.011820487959252503], ["order", 0.011820487959252503], ["knew", 0.011663615917592731], ["years", 0.009932795488193084], ["people", 0.009176222677474886], ["thing", 0.008879570597316698], ["time", 0.00646242522745947]], "sentiment": ["His very first investment was International Nitrate. After that came Trowbridge Helicopter, Electra Bakeries, Eternity Granite, Indiana Novelty, Norwich Iron, National Gelatin, Granada Oil, Del-Mar Creations, Richmond Electroplating, Anderson Trailer, and Eagle Duplicating.\nHis program for the next twelve months was this: Trowbridge Helicopter again, ELCO Hoist, Engineering Associates, Vickery Electronics, National Alum, National Dredging, Trowbridge Helicopter again.\nThe third time he bought Trowbridge Helicopter, he didn\u2019t buy a piece of it. He bought the whole thing\u2014 lock, stock, and barrel.\nTwo days after that, the company landed a long-term Government contract for intercontinental ballistic missiles, a contract that made the company worth, conservatively, fifty-nine million dollars. Noel Constant had bought the company for twenty-two million.\nThe only executive decision he ever made relative to the company was contained in an order written on a picture postcard of the Wilburhampton Hotel. The card was addressed to the president of the company, telling him to change the name of the company to Galactic Spacecraft, Inc., since the company had long since outgrown both Trowbridges and helicopters.\nSmall as this exercise of authority was, it was significant, for it showed that Constant had at last become interested in something he owned. And, though his holdings in the firm had more than doubled in value, he did not sell them all. He sold only forty-nine per cent of them.\nThereafter, he continued to take the advice of his Gideon Bible, but he kept big pieces of any firm he really liked.\nDuring his first two years in Room 223 of the Wilburhampton, Noel Constant had only one visitor. That visitor did not know he was rich. His one visitor was a chambermaid named Florence Whitehill, who spent one night out of ten with him for a small, flat fee.\nFlorence, like everyone else in the Wilburhampton, believed him when he said he was a trader in stamps. Personal hygiene was not Noel Constant\u2019s strongest suit. It was easy to believe that his work brought him into regular contact with mucilage.\nThe only people who knew how rich he was were employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and of the august

raised the other one, bringing herself one pace closer to the male.\nMary used to shut up then. There would be no more anthropomorphic jokes. It was up to the birds now to carry the show. Advancing toward each other in the same grave and stately manner, neither bird speeding up or slowing down, they were at last breast to breast and toe to toe.\nAt Ilium High School, the students did not expect to see the birds copulate. The film was so famous, since Mary had shown it in the auditorium in early May, as an educational celebration of springtime, for years and years, that everybody knew that they would not get to see the birds copulate.\nWhat those birds did on camera, though, was supremely erotic all the same. Already breast to breast and toe to toe, they made their sinuous necks as erect as flagpoles. They tilted their heads back as far as they would go. They pressed their long throats and the undersides of their jaws together. They formed a tower, the two of them\u2014a single structure, pointed on top and resting on four blue feet.\nThus was a marriage solemnized.\nThere were no witnesses, no other boobies to celebrate what a nice couple they were or how well they had danced. In the film Mary Hepburn used to show at the high school, which was the same film Bobby King thought Mrs. Onassis and Rudolf Nureyev might enjoy watching on educational television, the only witnesses were the big-brained members of the camera crew.\nThe name of the film was Sky-Pointing, the same name big-brained scientists gave to the moment when the beaks of both birds were pointed in the direction exactly opposite to the pull of gravity.\nAnd Mrs. Onassis was so moved by this film that she had her secretary call Bobby King the next morning, to inquire if it was too late to reserve two outside staterooms on the main deck of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d\n20\nMARY HEPBURN used to give her students extra credit if they would write a little poem or essay about the courtship dance. Something like half of them would turn something in, and about half who did thought the dance was proof that animals worshiped God. The rest of the responses were all over the place. One student turned in a poem which Mary would remember to her dying day, and which she taught to Mandarax. The student was named Noble Claggett, and he would be killed in the war in Vietnam\u2014but there his poem would be inside of Mandarax, along with bits by some of the greatest writers who ever lived.

early American antiques which Gregory had used in illustrations. I remembered the long table and the corner cupboard full of pewter and the rustic fireplace with a blunderbuss resting on pegs driven into its chimney breast, from a painting he had done of Thanksgiving at Plymouth Colony.\nI was put at one end of the table, with my silverware thrown down any which way, and no napkin. I still remember no napkin. While at the other end five places were very nicely set, with linen napkins and crystal and fine china and neatly deployed silverware, and with a candelabrum at their center. The servants were going to have a fine dinner party to which the apprentice was not invited. I was not to consider myself one of them.\nNor did any of the servants speak to me. I might as well have been a bum off the street. Fred Jones moreover stood over me while I ate\u2014like a sullen prison guard.\nWhile I was eating, and more lonesome than I had ever been in my life, a Chinese laundryman, Sam Wu, came in with clean shirts for Gregory. Pow! A flash of recognition went off in my skull. I knew him! And he must know me! Only days later would I realize why I thought I knew Sam Wu, although he certainly didn\u2019t know me. All dressed up in silk robes and wearing a skullcap, this simperingly polite laundryman had been the model for Dan Gregory\u2019s pictures of one of the most sinister characters in all of fiction, the Yellow Menace personified, the master criminal Fu Manchu!\nSam Wu would eventually become Dan Gregory\u2019s cook, and then go back to being a laundryman again. And he would be the person to whom I sent the paintings I bought in France during the war.\nIt was a curious and touching relationship we had during the war. I happened to run into Sam in New York City just before I went overseas, and he asked for my address. He had heard on the radio, he said, about how lonesome soldiers could be overseas, and that people should write to them often. He said I was the only soldier he knew well, so he would write to me.\nIt became a joke in our platoon at mail call. People would say to me things like: \u201cWhat\u2019s the latest news from Chinatown?\u201d or \u201cNo letter from Sam Wu this week? Maybe somebody poisoned his chow mein,\u201d and so on.\nAfter I got my pictures from him after the war, I never heard from him again. He may not even have liked me much. For him, I was strictly a wartime activity.\nBack to 1933:\nSince supper was so nasty, I would not have been surprised to be escorted next to a windowless room by the furnace, and told that that was to be my bedroom. But I was led up three flights of stairs to the most sumptuous chamber any Karabekian had ever occupied, and told to wait there until Gregory had time to see me, which would be in about six hours, at about midnight, Fred Jones estimated. Gregory was giving a dinner party in the dining room right below me for, among others, Al Jolson and the comedian W. C. Fields, and the author whose stories Gregory had illustrated countless times, Booth Tarkington. I would never meet any of them because they would never come back to the house again\u2014after a bitter argument with Gregory about Benito Mussolini.", 0.1294373837054758], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["hare", 0.13497604937832985], ["dresden", 0.11575959000543788], ["interviewer", 0.07336618140241197], ["massacre", 0.06748802468916493], ["revenge", 0.06748802468916493], ["bombed", 0.061777248518627405], ["correct", 0.0577253883432502], ["prisoner", 0.0577253883432502], ["thousands", 0.05458252142333176], ["killing", 0.05458252142333176], ["camps", 0.05458252142333176], ["argue", 0.04630383600217515], ["vonnegut", 0.04353174969863718], ["fellow", 0.042251975826797954], ["hell", 0.041124613746888986], ["bernard", 0.040080839491202766], ["slaughterhouse", 0.039109108906879506], ["21", 0.03862533051753982], ["fastest", 0.03862533051753982], ["shave", 0.03862533051753982], ["slower", 0.03862533051753982], ["testify", 0.03862533051753982], ["minimal", 0.03862533051753982], ["freed", 0.03862533051753982], ["applied", 0.03862533051753982], ["infants", 0.03862533051753982], ["zoo", 0.03862533051753982], ["ophuls", 0.03862533051753982], ["rabid", 0.03862533051753982], ["penalty", 0.033744012344582464], ["count", 0.033744012344582464], ["marcel", 0.033744012344582464], ["atrocity", 0.033744012344582464], ["deluxe", 0.033744012344582464], ["babies", 0.030888624259313702], ["scout", 0.030888624259313702], ["undefended", 0.030888624259313702], ["recall", 0.030888624259313702], ["schemes", 0.030888624259313702], ["faced", 0.030888624259313702], ["passing", 0.030888624259313702], ["nilly", 0.030888624259313702], ["willy", 0.030888624259313702], ["memory", 0.030888624259313702], ["17", 0.030888624259313702], ["19", 0.030888624259313702], ["pennsylvania", 0.030888624259313702], ["businessman", 0.030888624259313702], ["talk", 0.030318203145288044], ["death", 0.029823959204284243], ["people", 0.02959176177286205], ["book", 0.029375754322575092], ["20", 0.0288626941716251], ["18", 0.0288626941716251], ["bodies", 0.0288626941716251], ["franklin", 0.02729126071166588], ["bombing", 0.02729126071166588], ["bringing", 0.02729126071166588], ["lawyer", 0.02729126071166588], ["problem", 0.02729126071166588], ["numbers", 0.02729126071166588], ["nazis", 0.02600730608635634], ["animals", 0.02600730608635634], ["note", 0.024921737918558746], ["husband", 0.024921737918558746], ["battalion", 0.024921737918558746], ["print", 0.024921737918558746], ["hours", 0.024921737918558746], ["rights", 0.024921737918558746], ["film", 0.024921737918558746], ["friend", 0.02427601151826891], ["justice", 0.02398137599866774], ["edition", 0.02398137599866774], ["european", 0.02398137599866774], ["course", 0.023023230025078823], ["eventually", 0.022409942538708517], ["absolutely", 0.022409942538708517], ["millions", 0.022409942538708517], ["point", 0.021738744089382287], ["largest", 0.021738744089382287], ["baby", 0.021125987913398977], ["killed", 0.020562306873444493], ["body", 0.020562306873444493], ["thirty", 0.020562306873444493], ["mary", 0.019554554453439753], ["fire", 0.019554554453439753], ["library", 0.01910005782571038], ["war", 0.01889665080421299], ["question", 0.017528624365751155], ["large", 0.016244669740441618], ["wanted", 0.01568098870048713], ["happened", 0.015415211742861451], ["matter", 0.015415211742861451], ["german", 0.014911979602142121], ["history", 0.013587668112684798], ["best", 0.013389281655172853], ["wrote", 0.01282560061521837], ["city", 0.012473414554833431], ["called", 0.012473414554833431], ["told", 0.011511615012539412], ["asked", 0.011511615012539412], ["thought", 0.011218145319577665], ["write", 0.010533893569904088]], "sentiment": ["VONNEGUT: She freed me to write about what infants we really were: 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

I don\u2019t recall that that was a problem.\nINTERVIEWER: One more question; do you still think about the fire-bombing of Dresden at all?\nVONNEGUT: I wrote a book about it, called Slaughterhouse-Five. The book is still in print, and I have to do something about it as a businessman now and then. Marcel Ophuls asked me to be in his film, A Memory of Justice. He wanted me to talk about Dresden as an atrocity. I told him to talk to my friend Bernard V. O\u2019Hare, Mary\u2019s husband, instead, which he did. O\u2019Hare was a fellow battalion scout, and then a fellow prisoner of war. He\u2019s a lawyer in Pennsylvania now.\nINTERVIEWER: Why didn\u2019t you wish to testify?\nVONNEGUT: I had a German name. I didn\u2019t want to argue with people who thought Dresden should have been bombed to hell.

There were slower schemes for killing, of course.\nINTERVIEWER: The death camps.\nVONNEGUT: Yes\u2014in which millions were eventually killed. Many people see the Dresden massacre as correct and quite minimal revenge for what had been done by the camps. Maybe so. As I say, I never argue that point. I do note in passing that the death penalty was applied to absolutely anybody who happened to be in the undefended city\u2014babies, old people, the zoo animals, and thousands upon thousands of rabid Nazis, of course, and, among others, my best friend Bernard V.

The sailor reported this to his captain, who passed it on to American authorities. Fender and Izumi were promptly arrested, separated, and would never see each other again.\nFender was never able to find out what became of her. She vanished. The most believable rumor was that she had been turned over illegally to South Korean agents, who took her to Seoul\u2014where she was shot without trial.\nFender regretted nothing he had done.\nNow he was holding up the pants of my civilian suit, a gray, pinstripe Brooks Brothers suit, for me to see. He asked me if I remembered the large cigarette hole there had been in the crotch.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\u201cFind it,\u201d he said.\nI could not. Nor could I find any other holes in the suit.

I could have cried. I told him so.\nBefore he could make a reply, there were shouts and the thunder of scampering feet in offices in the front of the building\u2014offices whose windows faced the four-lane divided highway outside. It was believed that Virgil Greathouse, the former secretary of health, education, and welfare, had arrived out front. It was a false alarm.\nClyde Carter and Dr. Fender ran out into the reception area, so that they could see, too. There were no locked doors anywhere in the prison. Fender could have kept right on running outside, if he wanted to. Clyde didn\u2019t have a gun, and neither did any of the other guards.

if there hadn\u2019t been a prison break, even if the Social Security system hadn\u2019t gone bust and the College Treasurer hadn\u2019t run off with the pension funds and so on. For, as I\u2019ve said before, in 1991 Tarkington College fired me.\nThere I was in late middle age, cut loose in a thoroughly looted, bankrupt nation whose assets had been sold off to foreigners, a nation swamped by unchecked plagues and superstition and illiteracy and hypnotic TV, with virtually no health services for the poor. Where to go? What to do?\nTHE MAN WHO got me fired was Jason Wilder, the celebrated Conservative newspaper columnist, lecturer, and television talk-show host. He saved my life by doing that. If it weren\u2019t for him, I would have been on the Scipio side of the lake instead of the Athena side during the prison break.\nI would have been facing all those convicts as they crossed the ice to Scipio in the moonlight, instead of watching them in mute wonderment from the rear, like Robert E. Lee during Pickett\u2019s Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg. They wouldn\u2019t have known me, and I would still have seen only 3 Athena convicts in my time.\nI would have tried to fight in some way, although, unlike the College President, I would have had no guns. I would have been killed and buried along with the College President and his wife Zuzu, and Alton Darwin and all the rest of them. I would have been buried next to the stable, in the shadow of Musket Mountain when the Sun went down.\nTHE FIRST TIME I saw Jason Wilder in person was at the Board meeting when they fired me. He was then only an outraged parent. He would later join the Board and become by far the most valuable of the convicts\u2019 hostages after the prison break. Their threat to kill him immobilized units of the 82nd Airborne Division, which had been brought in by school bus from the South Bronx. The paratroops sealed off the valley at the head of the lake and occupied the shoreline across from Scipio and to the south of Scipio, and dug in on the western slope of Musket Mountain. But they dared not come any closer, for fear of causing the death of Jason Wilder.\nThere were other hostages, to be sure, including the rest of the Trustees, but he was the only famous one. I myself was not strictly a hostage, although I would probably have been killed if I had tried to leave. I was a sort of floating, noncombatant wise man, wandering wherever I pleased in Scipio under siege. As at Athena Prison, I tried to give the most honest answer I could to any question anyone might care to put to me. Otherwise I stayed silent. I volunteered no advice at Athena, and none in Scipio under siege. I simply described the truth of the inquirer\u2019s situation in the context of the world outside as best I could. What he did next was up to him.\nI call that being a teacher. I don\u2019t call that being a mastermind of a treasonous enterprise. All I ever wanted to overthrow was ignorance and self-serving fantasies.\nI WAS FIRED without warning on Graduation Day. I was playing the bells at high noon when a girl who had just completed her freshman year brought the news that the Board of Trustees, then meeting in Samoza Hall, the administration building, wanted to talk to me. She was Kimberley Wilder, Jason Wilder\u2019s learning-disabled daughter. She was stupid. I thought it was odd but not menacing that the Trustees would have used her for a messenger. I couldn\u2019t imagine what business she might have had that would bring her anywhere near their meeting. She had in fact been testifying before them about my supposed lack of patriotism, and had then asked for the honor of fetching me to my liquidation.\nShe was one of the few underclasspersons still on the campus. The rest had gone home, and relatives of those about to get their Associate in the Arts and Sciences certificates had taken over their suites. No relative of Kimberley\u2019s was about to graduate. She had stayed around for the Trustees\u2019 meeting. And her famous father had come by helicopter to back her up. The soccer field was being used as a heliport.
