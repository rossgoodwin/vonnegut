Americans owe their lives to superior machines, techniques, organization, and managers and engineers. For these means of surviving the wars, the Ghost Shirt Society and I thank God. But we cannot win good lives for ourselves in peacetime by the same methods we used to win battles in wartime. The problems of peace are altogether more subtle.\n\u201cI deny that there is any natural or divine law requiring that machines, efficiency, and organization should forever increase in scope, power, and complexity, in peace as in war. I see the growth of these now, rather, as the result of a dangerous lack of law.\n\u201cThe time has come to stop the lawlessness in that part of our culture which is your special responsibility.\n\u201cWithout regard for the wishes of men, any machines or techniques or forms of organization that can economically replace men do replace men. Replacement is not necessarily bad, but to do it without regard for the wishes of men is lawlessness.\n\u201cWithout regard for the changes in human life patterns that may result, new machines, new forms of organization, new ways of increasing efficiency, are constantly being introduced. To do this without regard for the effects on life patterns is lawlessness.\n\u201cI am dedicated, and the members of the Ghost Shirt Society are dedicated, to bringing this lawlessness to an end, to give the world back to the people. We are prepared to use force to end the lawlessness, if other means fail.\n\u201cI propose that men and women be returned to work as controllers of machines, and that the control of people by machines be curtailed. I propose, further, that the effects of changes in technology and organization on life patterns be taken into careful consideration, and that the changes be withheld or introduced on the basis of this consideration.\n\u201cThese are radical proposals, extremely difficult to put into effect. But the need for their being put into effect is far greater than all of the difficulties, and infinitely greater than the need for our national holy trinity, Efficiency, Economy, and Quality.\n\u201cMen, by their nature, seemingly, cannot be happy unless engaged in enterprises that make them feel useful.

MacDonald (referred to here as \u201cJohn D.\u201d) was a prolific writer of crime and suspense novels, most known for his \u201cTravis McGee\u201d series, set in Florida, where MacDonald lived. He was named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America, and in 1980 his novel The Green Ripper won the National Book Award for Mystery.\nDon\u2014\nJohn D.\u2019s wife died recently, as you probably know. The son is arranging a memorial service, and asking people like me to submit something to be read aloud there. This is my contribution. Kurt\nThere are lots of good little families which go unnoticed by even parochial little histories. One such had John D. and myself and our dear wives as members, as children, if you will, and with editors and agents in New York City as parental figures. When we came home from the Second World War, and having published nothing, we were determined to prosper by selling stories to the then exceedingly rich and popular magazines. When I say \u201cwe,\u201d I include the wives and eventually the children we had, since freelance story-telling was and remains very much a family enterprise. Without our mates, we would have sunk like stones.\nAnd again, we still would have sunk like stones if it had not been for strangers in New York City, far away, who knew one hell of a lot more about story-telling than we did in the beginning, although they themselves were not writers, and who volunteered to be our wise elders in a much larger family. They would become in time our most powerful supporters and, along with their wives, our dearest friends. To speak now of wives as natural assistants to working men is archaic, I realize. But the extended family to which John D. and I belonged was a creation of a more aggressively patriarchal society. For good or ill, that is the way things were back then. John D. and Dorothy are now both gone, still beloved and sorely missed. Also gone is our agent, well-known to many of you in Sarasota, Max Wilkinson, and his wife Mary, and his partner, Kenneth Littauer, a Colonel at the age of twenty-three in World War One, incidentally, and his wife Helen. Still alive is Knox Burger, an agent now, who, when fiction editor of Collier\u2019s Magazine, insisted that John D. and I and many returning veterans like us could become effective writers if we did not give up, if we kept on and on.\nSo we kept on and on. John D. achieved greatness, and so did Dorothy.

charmingly self-sufficient with respect to the fine arts. We sometimes had the director of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra to supper, or writers and painters, or architects like my father, of local renown.\nI studied clarinet under the first-chair clarinetist of our symphony orchestra. I remember the orchestra\u2019s performance of Tchaikovsky\u2019s 1812 Overture, in which the cannons\u2019 roars were supplied by a policeman firing blank cartridges into an empty garbage can. I knew the policeman. He sometimes guarded street crossings used by students on their way to or from School 43, my school, the James Whitcomb Riley School.\nIt is unsurprising, then, that the Middle West has produced so many artists of such different sorts, from world-class to merely competent, as provincial cities and towns in Europe used to do.\nI see no reason this satisfactory state of affairs should not go on and on, unless funding for instruction in and celebration of the arts, and especially in public school systems, is withdrawn.\nParticipation in an art is not simply one of many possible ways to make a living, an obsolescent trade as we approach the year 2000. Participation in an art, at bottom, has nothing to do with earning money. Participation in an art, although unrewarded by wealth or fame, and as the Middle West has encouraged so many of its young to discover for themselves so far, is a way to make one\u2019s soul grow.\nNo artist from anywhere, however, not even Shakespeare, not even Beethoven, not even James Whitcomb Riley, has changed the course of so many lives all over the planet as have four hayseeds in Ohio, two in Dayton and two in Akron. How I wish Dayton and Akron were in Indiana! Ohio could have Kokomo and Gary.\nOrville and Wilbur Wright were in Dayton in 1903 when they invented the airplane.\nDr. Robert Holbrook Smith and William Griffith Wilson were in Akron in 1935 when they devised the Twelve Steps to sobriety of Alcoholics Anonymous. By comparison with Smith and Wilson, Sigmund Freud was a piker when it came to healing dysfunctional minds and lives.\nBeat that! Let the rest of the world put that in their pipes and smoke it, not to mention Cole Porter, Hoagy Carmichael, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Louis Sullivan, Twyla Tharp and Bob Fosse, Ernest Hemingway and Saul Bellow, Mike Nichols and Elaine May.

Morty stayed behind long enough to give Lou a quizzical, annoyed glance. Then he, too, went into the living room, leaving only Emerald standing in the doorway.\nTears streamed over her cheeks. \"Oh, you poor lamb\u2014 please don\u2019t look so awful. It was my fault. I put you up to this.\"\n\"No,\" said Lou, finding his voice, \"really you didn\u2019t. Honest, Em, I was just\u2014\"\n\"You don\u2019t have to explain anything to me, hon. I\u2019m on your side no matter what.\" She kissed him on his cheek, and whispered in his ear. \"It wouldn\u2019t have been murder, hon. It wouldn\u2019t have killed him.

It just would have fixed him up so he\u2019d be able to go any time God decided He wanted him.\"\n\"What\u2019s gonna happen next, Em?\" said Lou hollowly. \"What\u2019s he gonna do?\"\nLou and Emerald stayed fearfully awake almost all night, waiting to see what Gramps was going to do. But not a sound came from the sacred bedroom. At two hours before dawn, the pair dropped off to sleep.\nAt six o\u2019clock they arose again, for it was time for their generation to eat breakfast in the kitchenette. No one spoke to them. They had twenty minutes in which to eat, but their reflexes were so dulled by the bad night that they had hardly swallowed two mouthfuls of egg-type processed seaweed before it was time to surrender their places to their son\u2019s generation.\nThen, as was the custom for whomever had been most recently disinherited, they began preparing Gramps\u2019 breakfast, which would presently be served to him in bed, on a tray. They tried to be cheerful about it. The toughest part of the job was having to handle the honest-to-God eggs and bacon and oleomargarine on which Gramps spent almost all of the income from his fortune.\n\"Well,\" said Emerald, \"I\u2019m not going to get all panicky until I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something to be panicky about.\"", -0.1514367816091954], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
