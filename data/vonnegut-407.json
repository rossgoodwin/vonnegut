["Dearest Nanny\u2014\nI reply to your good letter about what I\u2019ve done to your heart\u2014not once but several times:\nOne of my dear brother\u2019s favorite stories, which he got from a newspaper, I think, was about a woman whose car went out of control in a suburb. The car went through front yards, knocking down mailboxes and picket fences and post lanterns and shrubbery and so on. But then it made a u-turn at the end of the block, and went through the back yards of the same houses, wrecking barbecues and wading pools and teeter-totters and slides and so on. It finally stopped up against a big tree. The woman, miraculously, was still OK. When asked why she hadn\u2019t turned off the ignition, she said, \u201cI was too busy steering.\u201d\nSo whenever I\u2019ve broken your large and blameless heart, it was because I was too busy steering. Like the woman in the car, I have almost always been without a female pal\u2014a come-hell-or-high-water sidekick in the passenger seat. I have tried to do what was best for my children, which, among other things, required that I somehow make money any way I could\u2014selling cars, writing ads in Boston, teaching writing at a university a thousand miles away from my family. For a very brief but unforgettable time, I really did have a female sidekick in Iowa City, who really enjoyed what I believed and wrote. Guess who.\nWhen my car went out of control most recently, and I actually wound up in an ER, I was hoping to rescue normal Lily from incarceration in a maximum security lockdown for teen-age criminals. You made a plan which would allow me to do this, and, until I took a tumble in the dark, I was all set to do it\u2014even though I would be without a female sidekick under the same roof when the sun went down in the wintertime in Northampton. I had done as much for Edie, getting her out of brain-dead Barnstable High so many years ago.\nWhen I got back to this city all bunged up, and realizing that I was 77, for God\u2019s sake, and having been told that Jill would do all within her power to prevent Lily\u2019s going to Northampton High, and that Jill had found what is really a good school for Lily, which we didn\u2019t know existed, only two blocks away, I went to bed in a bed which had been mine for years, in a room where all my things were. I was exhausted and actually injured, and so gave myself what was unavailable from anyone else, which was TLC.\nJill and I are not speaking, thank goodness, and I am on the mend and Lily has begun to recapture the lost half of her junior year, and has made a lot of new friends. She is now the fourth member of our family to swear off liquor for the rest of her life, proudly counting the days since she has done so\u2014although she, unlike the other three, is not a genetic alcoholic.\nAnd I am not about to turn off the ignition. I could never do that to the rest of you.\nLove as always\u2014\nDAD", 0.14428603495270162], "title": "Letters"}}
