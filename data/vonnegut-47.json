of the Academy were its staff, office workers, cleaning and maintenance people, and armed guards. Nor were most of them enraptured by old-fashioned art practices. They needed the jobs, no matter how pointless the work might be, and so were reminiscent of people during the Great Depression of the 1930s, who celebrated when they got any kind of work at all.\nTrout characterized the sort of work he was able to get back then as \u201ccleaning birdshit out of cuckoo clocks.\u201d\nThe Academy\u2019s Executive Secretary certainly needed the work. Monica Pepper, who looked so much like my sister Allie, was the sole support of herself and her husband Zoltan, whom she had rendered hors de combat with a swan dive. So she had fortified the building by replacing the wooden front door with half-inch steel armorplate, fitted with a whoozit, or peephole, which could also be closed and locked.\nShe had done all she could to make the place look as abandoned and looted as the ruins of Columbia University two miles to the south. The windows, like the front door, were shuttered with steel, and the shutters were concealed in turn by rough plywood painted black and camouflaged with graffiti, which ran continuously across the whole fa\u00e7ade. The staff had done the garish artwork. Monica herself had spray-painted \u201cFUCK ART!\u201d in orange and purple across the steel front door.\nIt so happened that an African-American armed guard named Dudley Prince was looking out through that door\u2019s whoozit when Trout put \u201cThe Sisters B-36\u201d in the trash receptacle out front. Bums interacting with the receptacle were no novelty, God knows, but Trout, whom Prince mistook for a bag lady rather than a bag gentleman, put on an unusual show out there.\nHere\u2019s the thing about Trout\u2019s appearance from a distance: Instead of trousers, he wore three layers of thermal underwear, revealing the shapes of his calves below the hem of his unisex war-surplus Navy overcoat.

He wasn\u2019t remotely crazy. He would later say of his performance: \u201cIt was the world that had suffered the nervous breakdown. I was just having fun in a nightmare, arguing with an imaginary editor about the advertising budget, and about who should play whom in the movie, and personal appearances on TV shows and so on, perfectly harmless funny stuff.\u201d\nHis behavior was so outr\u00e9 that a genuine bag lady passing by asked him, \u201cAre you OK, honey?\u201d\nTo which Trout replied with all possible gusto, \u201cTing-a-ling! Ting-a-ling!\u201d\nWhen Trout returned to the shelter, though, the armed guard Dudley Prince unbolted the steel front door and, motivated by boredom and curiosity, retrieved the manuscript.

His easel was capable of holding a canvas eight feet high and twelve feet wide, I would guess. As I have already said, and particularly in view of the room\u2019s other decorations, it was easily mistaken for a guillotine.\nThe small canvas, whose back was turned toward visitors, was where a guillotine\u2019s fallen blade might be. It was the only picture I ever saw on the easel, as long as Father and I were on the same planet together, and some of our guests must have gone to the trouble of looking at its face. I think Mrs. Roosevelt did. I am sure the Secret Service agents did. They wanted to see everything.\nAnd what they saw on that canvas were brushstrokes laid down exuberantly and confidently, and promisingly, too, in prewar Vienna, when Father was only twenty years old. It was only a sketch so far\u2014of a nude model in the studio he rented after he moved out of the home of our relatives over there. There was a skylight. There was wine and cheese and bread on a checkered tablecloth.\nWas Mother jealous of that naked model? No. How could she be? When that picture was begun, Mother was only eleven years old.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThat rough sketch was the only respectable piece of artwork by my father that I ever saw. After he died in 1960, and Mother and I moved into our little two bedroom shitbox out in Avondale, we hung it over our fireplace. That was the same fireplace that would eventually kill Mother, since its mantelpiece had been made with radioactive cement left over from the Manhattan Project, from the atomic bomb project in World War Two.\nIt is still somewhere in the shitbox, I presume, since Midland City is now being protected against looters by the National Guard. And its special meaning for me is this: It is proof that sometime back when my father was a young, young man, he must have had a moment or two when he felt that he might have reason to take himself and his life seriously.\nI can hear him saying to himself in astonishment, after he had roughed in that promising painting: \u201cMy God!

He felt only the urge to walk away, to lose himself in darkness, to cleanse himself in silence. The moon had risen, and it shone between the fringes of cloud skeins that moved overhead.\nHis feet carried him with a will of their own, over the hard earth of the barnyard, over the worn-slick planks of the barn floor, up a ladder, and into the cavern-like sanctuary of the loft. He felt his way through the narrow corridor that had been left between the stacked hay bales until he came at last to its end, marked by the pale square of light from the small window overlooking the farmhouse. He sat beneath the window without first peering through it. He gathered his knees in his folded arms and rested his head against them. His eyes closed slowly, noting last of all a shred of white cloth tied to the wire of a nearby bale.

Weary was packed into another car in the same train.\nThere were narrow ventilators at the corners of the car, under the eaves. Billy stood by one of these, and, as the crowd pressed against him, he climbed part way up a diagonal corner brace to make more room. This placed his eyes on a level with the ventilator, so he could see another train about ten yards away.\nGermans were writing on the cars with blue chalk\u2014the number of persons in each car, their rank, their nationality, the date on which they had been put aboard. Other Germans were securing the hasps on the car doors with wire and spikes and other trackside trash. Billy could hear somebody writing on his car, too, but he couldn\u2019t see who was doing it.\nMost of the privates on Billy\u2019s car were very young\u2014at the end of childhood.

Meanwhile, why don\u2019t you forget about those cheers in the wirehouse and think about progerse in space?\u2019\n\"I said to him and I say to you and I say to everybody, \u2019Space can absorb the productivity of a trillion planets the size of earth. We could build and fire rockets forever, and never fill up space and never learn all there is to know about it.\u2019\n\"Now, these same people who like to weep and wail so much say, \u2019Oh, but Mr. President, what about the chrono-synclastic infundibula and what about this and what about that?\u2019 And I say to them, \u2019If people listened to people like you, there wouldn\u2019t ever be any progerse.

I first declare to you that the most wonderful thing, the most valuable thing you can get from an education is this\u2014the memory of one person who could really teach, whose lessons made life and yourselves much more interesting and full of possibilities than you had previously supposed possible. I ask this of everyone here, including all of us up here on the platform\u2014How many of us, how many of you, had such a teacher? Kindergarten counts. Please hold up your hands. Hurry. You may want to remember the name of that great teacher.\nI thank you for being educated. There, I\u2019ve thanked you now; that way I don\u2019t have to speak to a bunch of nincompoops. For you freshly minted college graduates, this is a puberty ceremony long overdue. We, whose principal achievement is that we are older than you, have to acknowledge at last that you are grown-ups, too. There are old poops possibly among us on this very day who will say that you are not grown-ups until you have somehow survived, as they have, some famous calamity\u2014The Great Depression, World War II, Vietnam, whatever. Storytellers are responsible for this destructive, not to say suicidal, myth. Again and again in stories, after some terrible mess, the character is able to say at last, \u201cToday, I am a woman; today I am a man. The end.\u201d\nI apologize. I said I would apologize; I apologize now. I apologize because of the terrible mess the planet is in. But it has always been a mess. There have never been any \u201cGood Old Days,\u201d there have just been days. And as I say to my grandchildren, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I just got here myself.\u201d\nSo you know what I\u2019m going to do? I declare everybody here a member of Generation A. Tomorrow is another day for all of us.\nHaving said that, I have made us, for a few hours at least, what most of us do not have and what we need so desperately\u2014I have made us an extended family, one for all and all for one. A husband, a wife and some kids is not a family; it\u2019s a terribly vulnerable survival unit. Now those of you who get married or are married, when you fight with your spouse, what each of you will be saying to the other one actually is, \u201cYou\u2019re not enough people. You\u2019re only one person. I should have hundreds of people around.\u201d\nNow, I\u2019ve made us an extended family. Does our family have a flag? Well, you bet. It\u2019s a big orange rectangle. Orange is a very good color and maybe the best one. It\u2019s full of vitamin C and cheerful associations, if one could forget the troubles in Ireland.\nNow this gathering is a work of art. The teacher whose name I mentioned when we all remembered good teachers asked me one time, \u201cWhat is it artists do?\u201d And I mumbled something. \u201cThey do two things,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, they admit they can\u2019t straighten out the whole universe. And then second, they make at least one little part of it exactly as it should be. A blob of clay, a square of canvas, a piece of paper, or whatever.\u201d We have all worked so hard and well to make these moments and this place exactly what it should be.", 0.15401734738691253],

That\u2019s all I can say.\nIf Selena was Nature\u2019s experiment with blindness, then her father was Nature\u2019s experiment with heartlessness. Yes, and Jes\u00fas Ortiz was Nature\u2019s experiment with admiration for the rich, and I was Nature\u2019s experiment with insatiable voyeurism, and my father was Nature\u2019s experiment with cynicism, and my mother was Nature\u2019s experiment with optimism, and the Captain of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was Nature\u2019s experiment with ill-founded self-confidence, and James Wait was Nature\u2019s experiment with purposeless greed, and Hisako Hiroguchi was Nature\u2019s experiment with depression, and Akiko was Nature\u2019s experiment with furriness, and on and on.\nI am reminded of one of my father\u2019s novels, The Era of Hopeful Monsters. It was about a planet where the humanoids ignored their most serious survival problems until the last possible moment. And then, with all the forests being killed and all the lakes being poisoned by acid rain, and all the groundwater made unpotable by industrial wastes and so on, the humanoids found themselves the parents of children with wings or antlers or fins, with a hundred eyes, with no eyes, with huge brains, with no brains, and on and on. These were Nature\u2019s experiments with creatures which might, as a matter of luck, be better planetary citizens than the humanoids. Most died, or had to be shot, or whatever, but a few were really quite promising, and they intermarried and had young like themselves.\nI will now call my own lifetime a million years ago \u201cthe Era of Hopeful Monsters,\u201d with most of the monsters novel in terms of personality rather than body type. And there are no such experiments, either with bodies or personalities, going on at the present time.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBig brains back then were not only capable of being cruel for the sake of cruelty. They could also feel all sorts of pain to which lower animals were entirely insensitive. No other sort of animal on earth could feel, as Jes\u00fas Ortiz felt as he descended in the elevator to the lobby, that he had been mangled by what *MacIntosh had said to him. He could not even be sure that there was enough of himself left to make living worthwhile.\nAnd his brain was so complicated that he was seeing all sorts of pictures inside his skull which no lower animal could ever see, all as imaginary, as purely matters of human opinion, as the fifty million dollars *Andrew MacIntosh was prepared to transfer instantly from Manhattan to Ecuador when the right words came over the telephone. He saw a picture of Se\u00f1ora Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, which was indistinguishable from pictures he had seen of the Virgin Mary. Ortiz was a Roman Catholic. Everybody in Ecuador was a Roman Catholic. The von Kleists were all Roman Catholics. Even the cannibals in the Ecuadorian rain forest, the elusive Kanka-bonos, were Roman Catholics.\nThis Se\u00f1ora Kennedy was beautiful and sad and pure and kind and all powerful. In the mind of Ortiz, though, she also presided over a host of minor deities, who were also going to take part in \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century,\u201d which included the six guests already at the hotel. Ortiz had expected nothing but goodness from any of them, and felt, as had most Ecuadorians until hunger started to set in, that their coming to Ecuador would be a glorious moment in their nation\u2019s history, and that every conceivable luxury should be lavished on them.\nBut now the truth about one of these supposedly wonderful visitors, *Andrew MacIntosh, had polluted Ortiz\u2019s mental picture not only of all the other minor deities, but of Se\u00f1ora Kennedy herself.\nSo that head-and-shoulders portrait grew fangs like a vampire, and the skin dropped off the face, but the hair stayed on.

The closest thing is the reruns of Groucho Marx\u2019s quiz show, You Bet Your Life. I\u2019ve known funny writers who stopped being funny, who became serious persons and could no longer make jokes. I\u2019m thinking of Michael Frayn, the British author who wrote The Tin Men. He became a very serious person. Something happened in his head.\nHumor is a way of holding off how awful life can be, to protect yourself. Finally, you get just too tired, and the news is too awful, and humor doesn\u2019t work anymore. Somebody like Mark Twain thought life was quite awful but held the awfulness at bay with jokes and so forth, but finally he couldn\u2019t do it anymore. His wife, his best friend, and two of his daughters had died. If you live long enough, a lot of people close to you are going to die.\nIt may be that I am no longer able to joke\u2014that it is no longer a satisfactory defense mechanism. Some people are funny, and some are not. I used to be funny, and perhaps I\u2019m not anymore. There may have been so many shocks and disappointments that the defense of humor no longer works. It may be that I have become rather grumpy because I\u2019ve seen so many things that have offended me that I cannot deal with in terms of laughter.\nThis may have happened already. I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to become from now on. I\u2019m simply along for the ride to see what happens to this body and this brain of mine. I\u2019m startled that I became a writer. I don\u2019t think I can control my life or my writing. Every other writer I know feels he is steering himself, and I don\u2019t have that feeling. I don\u2019t have that sort of control. I\u2019m simply becoming.\nAll I really wanted to do was give people the relief of laughing. Humor can be a relief, like an aspirin tablet. If a hundred years from now people are still laughing, I\u2019d certainly be pleased.\nI apologize to all of you who are the same age as my grandchildren. And many of you reading this are probably the same age as my grandchildren. They, like you, are being royally shafted and lied to by our Baby Boomer corporations and government.\nYes, this planet is in a terrible mess. But it has always been a mess. There have never been any \u201cGood Old Days,\u201d there have just been days. And as I say to my grandchildren, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I just got here.\u201d\nThere are old poops who will say that you do not become a grown-up until you have somehow survived, as they have, some famous calamity\u2014the Great Depression, the Second World War, Vietnam, whatever. Storytellers are responsible for this destructive, not to say suicidal, myth. Again and again in stories, after some terrible mess, the character is able to say at last, \u201cToday I am a woman. Today I am a man. The end.\u201d\nWhen I got home from the Second World War, my Uncle Dan clapped me on the back, and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re a man now.\u201d So I killed him. Not really, but I certainly felt like doing it.\nDan, that was my bad uncle, who said a male can\u2019t be a man unless he\u2019d gone to war.", -0.00932034632034631], "title": "A Man without a

very badly at the University of Michigan while I did badly at Cornell. His father asked him what the trouble was, and he made what I consider an admirable reply: \u201cDon\u2019t you know, Father? I\u2019m dumb!\u201d It was the truth.\nI did badly in the Army, remaining a preposterously tall private for the three years I served. I was a good soldier, an especially deadly marksman, but nobody thought to promote me. I learned all the dances of close-order drill. Nobody in the Army could dance better than I could in ranks. If a third world war comes, I am still spry enough to dance again.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYes, and I was a mediocrity in the anthropology department of the University of Chicago after the Second World War. Triage was practiced there as it is practiced everywhere. There were those students who would surely be anthropologists, and the most winsome faculty members gave them intensive care. A second group of students, in the opinion of the faculty, just might become so-so anthropologists, but more probably, would use what they had learned about Homo sapiens to good advantage in some other field, such as medicine or law, say.\nThe third group, of which I was a member, might as well have been dead\u2014or studying chemistry. We were given as a thesis advisor the least popular faculty member, un-tenured and justifiably paranoid. His position paralleled that of the waiter Mespoulets in the stories of Ludwig Bemelmans about the fictitious Hotel Splendid. Mespoulets had the table next to the kitchen, and his specialty was making sure that certain sorts of guests at the hotel restaurant never came back again.\nThis terrible faculty advisor of mine was surely the most exciting and instructive teacher I have ever had. He gave courses whose lectures were chapters in books he was writing about the mechanics of social change, and which no one, as it turned out, would ever publish.\nAfter I left the university, I would visit him whenever business brought me to Chicago. He never remembered me, and seemed annoyed by my visits\u2014especially, I suppose, when I brought the wonderful news of my having been published here and there.\nOne night on Cape Cod, when I was drunk and reeking of mustard gas and roses, and calling up old friends and enemies, as used to be my custom, I called up my beloved old thesis advisor. I was told he was dead\u2014at the age of about fifty, I think. He had swallowed cyanide. He had not published. He had perished instead.\nAnd I wish I had an unpublished essay of his on the mechanics of social change to paste into this collage of mine now.\nI do not give his name, because I do not think he would like to see it here.", 0.08632404181184669], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["charley", 0.31711504992122885], ["ned", 0.17464104673427783], ["drink", 0.1428931346422387], ["horror", 0.12578908805753472], ["represented", 0.11186533872764721], ["swallow", 0.11186533872764721], ["watch", 0.10883103387767343], ["danger", 0.09786236538300185], ["celebration", 0.0896711510777864], ["quizzical", 0.05593266936382361], ["planning", 0.05593266936382361], ["niagara", 0.05593266936382361], ["tightrope", 0.05593266936382361], ["test", 0.05593266936382361], ["celebrate", 0.05593266936382361], ["tickets", 0.05593266936382361], ["obvious", 0.05593266936382361], ["admission", 0.05593266936382361], ["alcoholic", 0.04893118269150092], ["celebrating", 0.04893118269150092], ["flattering", 0.04893118269150092], ["falls", 0.04893118269150092], ["terrifying", 0.04893118269150092], ["dramatic", 0.04893118269150092], ["aware", 0.04893118269150092], ["gesture", 0.04893118269150092], ["pretty", 0.04683754428586538], ["walking", 0.0448355755388932], ["cheerfully", 0.0448355755388932], ["going", 0.042828179900619406], ["remained", 0.041929696019178245], ["fully", 0.041929696019178245], ["worried", 0.041929696019178245], ["trap", 0.041929696019178245], ["price", 0.037834088866570526], ["ordinary", 0.037834088866570526], ["perfectly", 0.037834088866570526], ["today", 0.037834088866570526], ["darn", 0.037834088866570526], ["imagination", 0.037834088866570526], ["happen", 0.03627701129255781], ["worth", 0.03627701129255781], ["uh", 0.03627701129255781], ["week", 0.03627701129255781], ["forward", 0.03627701129255781], ["scared", 0.03492820934685557], ["brewer", 0.03492820934685557], ["fall", 0.03492820934685557], ["leaned", 0.03492820934685557], ["touch", 0.0337384817139628], ["huh", 0.0337384817139628], ["sell", 0.032674234081055464], ["glass", 0.03171150499212289], ["point", 0.030832602194247844], ["talked", 0.030832602194247844], ["death", 0.030832602194247844], ["thing", 0.029836186999436715], ["thinking", 0.027926722674532885], ["sat", 0.023831115521925163], ["closed", 0.02302260332320257], ["guess", 0.022274037947912453], ["knew", 0.02061441116719249], ["hand", 0.020312866084872476], ["boy", 0.020312866084872476], ["face", 0.019458751054285985], ["turned", 0.01817843079530473], ["long", 0.01794074900328257], ["years", 0.017042289548570486], ["good", 0.012321678318002287]], "sentiment": ["\u201cDid I say I was worried?\u201d said Ned.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t take much imagination to guess what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d said Charley.

That is why the Americans will lose the war\u2014you are all too soft.\u201d He looked pointedly at Kniptash, who was still up to his nostrils in imaginary cakes, eggs, and honey. \u201cCome, come, back to work.\u201d It was a suggestion.\nThe three American soldiers remained seated within the roofless shell of a building amid the smashed masonry and timbers of Dresden, Germany. The time was early March, 1945. Kniptash, Donnini, and Coleman were prisoners of war. Corporal Kleinhans was their guard. He was to keep them busy at arranging the city\u2019s billion tons of rubble into orderly cairns, rock by rock, out of the way of non-existent traffic. Nominally, the three Americans were being punished for minor defections in prison discipline. Actually, their being marched out to work in the streets every morning under the sad blue eyes of the lackadaisical Kleinhans was no better, no worse than the fates of their better-behaved comrades behind the barbed-wire. Kleinhans asked only that they appear to be busy when officers passed.\nFood was the only thing on the P.W.\u2019s pale level of existence that could have any effect on their spirits. Patton was a hundred miles away. To hear Kniptash, Donnini, and Coleman speak of the approaching Third Army, one would have thought it was spear-headed, not by infantry and tanks, but by a phalanx of mess sergeants and kitchen trucks.\n\u201cCome, come,\u201d said Corporal Kleinhans again. He brushed plaster dust from his ill-fitting uniform, the thin, cheap grey of the homeguard, the pathetic army of old men. He looked at his watch. Their lunch hour, which had been thirty minutes with nothing to eat, was over.\nDonnini wistfully leafed through his notebook for another minute before returning it to his breast pocket and struggling to his feet.\nThe notebook craze had begun with Donnini\u2019s telling Coleman how to make Pizza pie. Coleman had written it down in one of several notebooks he had taken from a bombed-out stationery store. He had found the experience so satisfying, that all three were soon obsessed with filling the notebooks with recipes. Setting down the symbols for food somehow made them feel much closer to the real thing.\nEach had divided his booklet into departments. Kniptash, for instance, had four major departments: \u201cDesserts I Am Going to Try,\u201d \u201cGood Ways to Fix Meat,\u201d \u201cSnacks,\u201d and \u201cMissalanious.\u201d", -0.02405934343434344], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
