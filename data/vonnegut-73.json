Scholes asked Kurt if he expected a turn in his fortunes as a writer, Vonnegut said, \u201cI never expect anything good to happen. I never expected the university to hire me. I thought I was going to starve to death.\u201d\nHe was \u201coffered the job [at Iowa] at the last minute when Robert Lowell decided not to appear,\u201d Kurt told Steve Wilbers, who was writing a history of the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop for a dissertation in 1976. \u201cI needed the money. I needed the stimulation. I needed the change in scene \u2026 It turned out to be a very bright thing for me to do. Suddenly writing seemed very important again. My neighbors on Cape Cod didn\u2019t read me, didn\u2019t read anything, so I had felt like a pointless citizen there. In Iowa City I was central and spectacular. This was better than a transplant of monkey glands for a man my age.\u201d\n\u201cI was also elated by belonging to a huge and extended family of artists. As for my students: They were so able and interesting, most of them, that I thought of them, almost from the first, as colleagues. I remain in touch with many of them to this day, and colleagues are what they have truly become.\u201d His students included Gail Godwin, John Irving, and others who went on to become writers, editors, and college professors. His fellow teachers, the writers Richard Yates, Nelson Algren, Vance Bourjaily, Paul Engle, and Jos\u00e9 Donoso, a leading Chilean novelist, also became friends for life.\nIn an autobiographical opening to Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut wrote cryptically: \u201cI taught creative writing in the famous Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa for a couple of years \u2026 I got into some perfectly beautiful trouble, got out of it again.\u201d\nHis reference was to a brief affair and lifetime friendship with one of his students who was \u201ca single mom, with two kids,\u201d in her second year of graduate work at the Writers\u2019 Workshop: Loree Wilson Rackstraw. Kurt later gave her permission to use any of the letters and other writing he sent her, which she quoted from in her book about their friendship (Love As Always, Kurt: Vonnegut As I Knew Him). She wrote that their friendship \u201cwas sustained mostly by the U.S. Postal Service over the years.\u201d\nKurt received the lowest salary of any of the Iowa faculty because he did not hold an advanced academic degree\u2014in fact, he did not have a college degree at all. Since he had finished his course work for the master\u2019s degree in anthropology at the University of Chicago, Vonnegut needed only to write a thesis the anthropology department would accept to get his M.A.\u2014and, with it, a much-needed raise in salary. So he tried again.\nThis time he wrote a thesis comparing stories of primitive societies to contemporary short stories. This, too, was rejected\u2014he was told that it wasn\u2019t valid to compare primitive and civilized societies. In 1971 (after he was rich and famous and did not need a twenty percent raise anymore) he was awarded a master\u2019s degree in anthropology from the University of Chicago, on the grounds that his novel Cat\u2019s Cradle (published in 1963, before Vonnegut went to Iowa) made \u201ca contribution to the field of cultural anthropology.\u201d So it goes. Kurt spelled out his reaction in Palm Sunday, \u201cThe University of Chicago \u2026 can take a flying fuck at the moooo\u200booooo\u200booooo\u200boooon.\u201d\nWhile teaching at Iowa in 1966, Vonnegut wrote a review of a new Random House dictionary for The New York Times Book Review and got a fan letter that would change his life. The letter was from Seymour Lawrence, a former editor of the Atlantic Monthly Press, who had opened his own publishing company the year before in a one-room office at 90 Beacon Street in Boston. He admired the style and humor of Vonnegut\u2019s review and told him to stop by his office if he ever needed a new publisher. Lawrence had also begun to hear murmurings of an underground following for Vonnegut\u2019s novels, especially Cat\u2019s Cradle, which was being passed around in well-thumbed paperback copies by admiring college students.\nKurt left Iowa when he got a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 (on his second try) and went back to Dresden to see if it would help him with the novel he\u2019d been trying to write about his experience there in WWII. He then returned to Cape Cod to finish the book. Knowing he would soon be running out of money again, and unable to interest his previous publishers in his unfinished novel, he went up to Boston and rang the bell at 90 Beacon Street, introducing himself to Sam Lawrence and offering him the unfinished manuscript. Sam read it and offered Vonnegut a three-book contract for both hardcover and paperback rights.

foolish, but to remind him of how comforting and encouraging the make-believe of religion can be for common folk.\nTo quote from Kilgore Trout\u2019s story \u201cEmpire State,\u201d which is about a meteor the size and shape of the Manhattan skyscraper, approaching Earth point-first at a steady fifty-four miles an hour: \u201cScience never cheered up anyone. The truth about the human situation is just too awful.\u201d\nAnd the truth about that situation all over the world will never be worse than it was during the first couple of hours after the rerun stopped. Oh sure, there were millions of pedestrians lying on the ground because the weight on their feet had been unevenly distributed when free will kicked in. But most of them were pretty much OK, except for those who had been near the tops of escalators or stairways. Most were no worse hurt than the woman Allie and I saw come shooting out of a streetcar headfirst.\nThe real mayhem was wrought, as I said before, by self-propelled forms of transportation, of which there were none, of course, inside the former Museum of the American Indian. Things stayed peaceful in there, even as the crashing of vehicles and the cries of the injured and dying reached the climax of a crescendo outside.\n\u201cI fry mine in butter!\u201d indeed.\nThe bums, or \u201csacred cattle,\u201d as Trout called them, had been seated or prone or supine when the timequake struck. That was how they were when the rerun ended. How could free will hurt them?\nTrout would say of them afterward: \u201cEven before the timequake, they had exhibited symptoms indistinguishable from those of PTA.\u201d\nOnly Trout jumped to his feet when a berserk fire truck, a hook-and-ladder, smacked the entrance of the Academy with its right front bumper and kept on going. What it did after that had nothing to do with people, and could have nothing to do with people. The sudden reduction of its velocity by its brush with the Academy caused the gaga firepersons aboard to hurtle through the air at the velocity it had reached going downhill from Broadway before it hit. Trout\u2019s best guess, based on how far the firepersons flew, was about fifty miles an hour.\nThus slowed and depopulated, the emergency vehicle made a sharp left turn into a cemetery across the street from the Academy. It started up a steep slope. It stopped short of the crest, and then rolled backward. The collision with the Academy had knocked its gearshift into neutral!\nMomentum alone had carried it up the slope. The mighty motor roared. Its throttle was stuck. But the only opposition it could offer to gravity was the inertia of its own mass.

The door opened for me. There stood my mother, Emma, who was herself a child. Outside of school, she had never had any responsibilities, any work to do. Her servants had raised her children. She was purely ornamental.\nNothing bad was supposed to happen to her\u2014ever. But here she was in a thin bathrobe now, without her husband or servants, or her basso profundo elder son. And there I was, her gangling, flute-voiced younger son, a murderer.\nShe wasn\u2019t about to hug me, or cover my inky head with kisses. She was not what I would call demonstrative. When Felix went off to war, she shook his hand by way of encouragement\u2014and then blew a kiss to him when his train was a half a mile away.\nAnd, oh, Lord, I don\u2019t mean to make a villain of this woman, with whom I spent so many years. After Father died, I would be paired off with her, like a husband with a wife. We had each other, and that was about all we had. She wasn\u2019t wicked. She simply wasn\u2019t useful.\n\u201cWhat is that all over you?\u201d she said. She meant the ink. She was protecting herself. She didn\u2019t want to get it on her, too.\nShe was so far from imagining what I might want that she did not even get out of the doorway so I could come inside. I wanted to get into my bed and pull the covers over my head. That was my plan. That is still pretty much my plan.\nSo, keeping me outside, and not even sure whether she wanted to let me in or not, seemingly, she asked me when Father was coming home, and whether everything was going to be all right now, and so on.\nShe needed good news, so I gave it to her. I said that I was fine, and that Father was fine. Father would be home soon, I said. He just had to explain some things. She let me in, and I went to bed as planned.\nMisinformation of that sort would continue to pacify her, day after day, year after year, until nearly the end of her life. At the end of her life, she would become combative and caustically witty, a sort of hick-town Voltaire, cynical and skeptical and so on. An autopsy would reveal several small tumors in her head, which doctors felt almost certainly accounted for this change in personality.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.05322249589490968], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["torch", 0.12054498754924517], ["browne", 0.12054498754924517], ["hat", 0.12054498754924517], ["pick", 0.12054498754924517], ["dying", 0.12054498754924517], ["belt", 0.10531098358089472], ["sam", 0.09639966252357245], ["jones", 0.0934399615149667], ["robert", 0.09007697961254427], ["colored", 0.07777773152605147], ["black", 0.07604647592778163], ["puttees", 0.060272493774622585], ["thumbs", 0.060272493774622585], ["shake", 0.060272493774622585], ["arthritically", 0.060272493774622585], ["haired", 0.060272493774622585], ["hooked", 0.060272493774622585], ["tom", 0.060272493774622585], ["malevolent", 0.060272493774622585], ["whistle", 0.060272493774622585], ["uncle", 0.060272493774622585], ["stride", 0.060272493774622585], ["cotton", 0.060272493774622585], ["nickel", 0.060272493774622585], ["luftwaffe", 0.060272493774622585], ["piping", 0.060272493774622585], ["wrinkled", 0.060272493774622585], ["fallen", 0.060272493774622585], ["door", 0.05583204295218054], ["insignia", 0.05265549179044736], ["chin", 0.05265549179044736], ["plated", 0.05265549179044736], ["ain", 0.05265549179044736], ["thrust", 0.05265549179044736], ["chaplain", 0.05265549179044736], ["knock", 0.05265549179044736], ["wore", 0.05265549179044736], ["yellow", 0.04819983126178622], ["sharp", 0.04819983126178622], ["forward", 0.04819983126178622], ["step", 0.04819983126178622], ["strong", 0.04819983126178622], ["introduced", 0.04819983126178622], ["leather", 0.04819983126178622], ["chauffeur", 0.04503848980627213], ["listened", 0.04258636286875335], ["harlem", 0.04258636286875335], ["lead", 0.040582829277611], ["august", 0.038888865763025735], ["gonna", 0.038888865763025735], ["walked", 0.03612716874894985], ["will", 0.03413123737947977], ["question", 0.03392199627134379], ["stood", 0.03392199627134379], ["uniform", 0.03392199627134379], ["opened", 0.03208623709922108], ["krapptauer", 0.030513700355916978], ["news", 0.02980448583792169], ["fuehrer", 0.02980448583792169], ["iron", 0.02980448583792169], ["guard", 0.029138281202576256], ["eyes", 0.029138281202576256], ["died", 0.028510166764774622], ["keeley", 0.027352358900402902], ["hands", 0.025816513379796766], ["heard", 0.024900231962884115], ["white", 0.02253637064841219], ["long", 0.022187483853746467], ["man", 0.02189363876392341], ["dead", 0.021849333758507415], ["asked", 0.020592077152158578], ["people", 0.016437504251938247], ["time", 0.013743850866960394]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI\u2019m the Chaplain,\u201d said Keeley.\n\u201cOh, who, who, who will lead the Iron Guard now?\u201d said Jones. \u201cWho will step forward and pick up the fallen torch?\u201d\nThere was a sharp, strong knock on the door.

Desamol isn\u2019t recommended for men anymore, except for sex offenders.\nB: Actually, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me this time, thank goodness. I\u2019m back at dear old Caldwell University for my class reunion.\nK: Which class is that?\nB: Upper. What other class can afford to stay here?

"sentiment": ["Now her big brain had her say out loud to the Captain\u2019s image on the cathode-ray tube, to the considerable embarrassment of her soul, although there was no one to hear her: \u201cWould you by any chance like to marry me?\u201d\nIt would turn out that she knew at least a little bit more about machinery than he did, just from living with Roy. After Roy died, and the lawn mower wouldn\u2019t start, for example, she was able to change the spark plug and get it going\u2014something the Captain could never have done.\nAnd she knew a whole lot more about the islands. It was Mary who correctly identified the island on which they would be marooned. The Captain, grasping for shreds of self-respect and authority after his big brain had made such a mess of things, declared the island to be R\u00e1bida, which it surely wasn\u2019t and which, in any case, he had never seen.\nAnd what allowed Mary to recognize Santa Rosalia were the dominant sorts of finches there. These drab little birds, incidentally, so uninteresting to most tourists and to Mary\u2019s students, had been as exciting to young Charles Darwin as the great land tortoises or the boobies or marine iguanas, or any other creatures there. The thing was: The finches looked very much alike, but they were in fact divided into thirteen species, each species with its own peculiar diet and method for getting food.\nNone had close relatives on the mainland of South America or anywhere. Their ancestors might, too, have arrived on Noah\u2019s ark or a natural raft, since it was wholly out of character for a finch to set out on a flight of a thousand kilometers over open ocean.\nThere were no woodpeckers on the islands, but there was a finch which ate what woodpeckers would have eaten. It couldn\u2019t peck wood, and so it took a twig or a spine from a cactus in its blunt little beak, and used that to dig insects out of their hiding places.\nAnother sort of finch was a bloodsucker, surviving by pecking at the long neck of an unheeding booby until it had raised little beads of blood. Then it sipped that perfect diet to its heart\u2019s content. This bird was called by human beings: Geospiza difficilis.\nThe principal nesting place of these queer finches, their Garden of Eden, was the Island of Santa Rosalia. She would probably never have heard of that island, so removed from the rest of the archipelago, and so rarely visited by anyone, if it weren\u2019t for its swarms of Geospiza difficilis. And she surely wouldn\u2019t have lectured so much about it if the bloodsuckers hadn\u2019t been the only finches she could make her students give much of a damn about.\nGreat teacher that she was, she would go along with her students by describing the birds as \u201c\u2026 ideal pets for Count Dracula.\u201d This entirely fictitious count, she knew, was a far more significant person to most of her students than George Washington, for instance, who was merely the founder of their country.\nThey were better informed about Dracula, too, so that Mary could expand her joke admitting that he might not enjoy Geospiza difficilis as a pet after all, since he, whom she then called \u201cHomo transylvaniensis,\u201d slept all through the daytime, whereas Geospiza difficilis slept all through the night. \u201cSo perhaps,\u201d she would decide with mock sadness, \u201cthe best pet for Count Dracula remains a member of the family Desmodontidae\u2014which is a scientific way of saying: \u2018vampire bat.\u2019\u201d", 0.2235227272727273], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["patch", 0.3203762187058153], ["eye", 0.1534078223434885], ["stripped", 0.07547433898197126], ["tissue", 0.07547433898197126], ["recoil", 0.07547433898197126], ["tearing", 0.07547433898197126], ["floor", 0.07173185732852021], ["harrison", 0.06557223640254348], ["stepping", 0.06557223640254348], ["surgery", 0.06557223640254348], ["scar", 0.06557223640254348], ["disfigurement", 0.06557223640254348], ["cool", 0.06557223640254348], ["benjamin", 0.06557223640254348], ["horror", 0.06557223640254348], ["plain", 0.06557223640254348], ["upset", 0.06557223640254348], ["disgust", 0.06557223640254348], ["point", 0.06535632729097136], ["plastic", 0.05977987771528398], ["nurse", 0.05977987771528398], ["mess", 0.05977987771528398], ["lucky", 0.05977987771528398], ["chose", 0.05567013382311568], ["lot", 0.05377160991645237], ["hold", 0.052482368804341255], ["surgeon", 0.052482368804341255], ["fort", 0.052482368804341255], ["view", 0.052482368804341255], ["cry", 0.04767562256689536], ["dropped", 0.04767562256689536], ["glass", 0.04767562256689536], ["clean", 0.04767562256689536], ["missed", 0.0457680312436879], ["slazinger", 0.044158117441560576], ["hospital", 0.0440854164485967], ["hair", 0.041218692227708825], ["secret", 0.041218692227708825], ["bit", 0.0399756725564284], ["paper", 0.03777351998746757], ["daughter", 0.035865928664260104], ["foyer", 0.034999862638311036], ["place", 0.03418331386916891], ["true", 0.03267816364548568], ["army", 0.03131658964828104], ["edith", 0.03131658964828104], ["celeste", 0.03007356997700061], ["wouldn", 0.02893010272452152], ["head", 0.02893010272452152], ["paul", 0.02839095518190942], ["cook", 0.026885804958226185], ["looked", 0.026417378917897746], ["wife", 0.025097760058883246], ["going", 0.014987103202010417], ["war", 0.013987694793340265], ["time", 0.010570127806685493]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHe was lucky she didn\u2019t paper him!\u201d I said.\nAnd Celeste said, \u201cYou know you dropped your patch?\u201d\n\u201cMy what?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYour eye patch,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s on the floor and you\u2019re stepping on it.\u201d\nIt was true!

A cluster of new stores and luxury hotels in Atlanta had gone bankrupt, and Leen had tried to snap it all up for RAMJAC. He had been outbid, however, by a South Korean religious cult.\nLawes asked me if I had any children. I said I had a son who worked for The New York Times. Lawes laughed and said that he and my son had the same boss now: Arpad Leen. I had missed the news that morning, so he had to explain to me that RAMJAC had just acquired control of The New York Times and all of its subsidiaries, which included the second-largest catfood company in the world.\n\u201cWhen he was down here,\u201d said Lawes, \u201cMr. Leen told me this was going to happen. It was the catfood company he wanted\u2014not The New York Times.\u201d\nThe two lawyers got into the backseat of the limousine. They weren\u2019t subdued at all. They were laughing about the guard who looked like the President of the United States. \u201cI felt like saying to him,\u201d said one, \u201c\u2018Mr. President, why don\u2019t you just pardon him right here and now? He\u2019s suffered enough, and he could get in some good golf this afternoon.\u2019\u201d\nOne of them tried on the false beard, and the other one said he looked like Karl Marx. And so on. They were incurious about me. Cleveland Lawes told them that I had been visiting my son. They asked me what my son was in for and I said, \u201cMail fraud.\u201d That was the end of the conversation.\nSo off we went to Atlanta. There was a curious object stuck by means of a suction cup to the glove compartment in front of me, I remember. Coming out of the cup and aimed at my breastbone was what looked like about a foot of green garden hose. At the end of the shaft was a white plastic wheel the size of a dinner plate. Once we got going, the wheel began to hypnotize me, bobbing up and down when we went over bumps, swaying this way and then that way as we went around curves.\nSo I asked about it. It was a toy steering wheel, it turned out. Lawes had a seven-year-old son he sometimes took with him on trips. The little boy could pretend to be steering the limousine with the plastic wheel. There had been no such toy when my own son was little. Then again, he wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it much. Even at seven, young Walter hated to go anywhere with his mother and me.\nI said it was a clever toy.", 0.07195601333532367], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["models", 0.1138071890864812], ["shop", 0.0779719997019201], ["model", 0.07488898610537495], ["em", 0.06662949698352154], ["school", 0.0658492836305138], ["florida", 0.06122329554207935], ["records", 0.05441228722519947], ["clarinet", 0.05198133313461341], ["gate", 0.046575131693171214], ["play", 0.04068402832945069], ["job", 0.03976412337629134], ["high", 0.03976412337629134], ["midget", 0.03976412337629134], ["battleship", 0.03793572969549373], ["concerned", 0.03793572969549373], ["sophomore", 0.03793572969549373], ["gawky", 0.03793572969549373], ["sarasota", 0.03793572969549373], ["license", 0.03793572969549373], ["sticking", 0.03793572969549373], ["nerve", 0.03793572969549373], ["duco", 0.03793572969549373], ["selling", 0.03793572969549373], ["cops", 0.03793572969549373], ["turrets", 0.03793572969549373], ["freak", 0.03793572969549373], ["pontiac", 0.03793572969549373], ["missouri", 0.03793572969549373], ["cadillacs", 0.03793572969549373], ["woman", 0.0366122730021016], ["girl", 0.03465756001287659], ["ilium", 0.03465756001287659], ["great", 0.03406486984526548], ["heard", 0.03406486984526548], ["marching", 0.03331474849176077], ["thumb", 0.03331474849176077], ["balled", 0.03331474849176077], ["flunked", 0.03331474849176077], ["accident", 0.03331474849176077], ["frank", 0.031161890060667205], ["making", 0.030974181657834488], ["criminal", 0.030611647771039675], ["cuba", 0.030611647771039675], ["shipped", 0.030611647771039675], ["mixed", 0.030611647771039675], ["straight", 0.030611647771039675], ["advice", 0.030611647771039675], ["med", 0.0286937672880278], ["pre", 0.0286937672880278], ["lock", 0.0286937672880278], ["stole", 0.0286937672880278], ["doctor", 0.0286937672880278], ["underground", 0.0286937672880278], ["cleared", 0.0286937672880278], ["pulled", 0.0286937672880278], ["queer", 0.027206143612599733], ["cornell", 0.027206143612599733], ["board", 0.027206143612599733], ["plate", 0.027206143612599733], ["miracle", 0.027206143612599733], ["miserable", 0.027206143612599733], ["nope", 0.027206143612599733], ["funeral", 0.027206143612599733], ["russian", 0.027206143612599733], ["kid", 0.027206143612599733], ["band", 0.027206143612599733], ["wasn", 0.02635716516826337], ["police", 0.025990666567306704], ["cemetery", 0.025990666567306704], ["hobby", 0.025990666567306704], ["indianapolis", 0.025990666567306704], ["cement", 0.025990666567306704], ["friends", 0.025990666567306704], ["age", 0.025990666567306704], ["jack", 0.024962995368458314], ["care", 0.024962995368458314], ["ring", 0.024962995368458314], ["famous", 0.02407278608429483], ["expect", 0.02407278608429483], ["imagine", 0.02407278608429483], ["tall", 0.02407278608429483], ["going", 0.023711152651945525], ["car", 0.023287565846585607], ["cab", 0.023287565846585607], ["played", 0.023287565846585607], ["reason", 0.022585162408866766], ["raised", 0.022585162408866766], ["angel", 0.022585162408866766], ["driver", 0.022585162408866766], ["guess", 0.021949761210171267], ["poor", 0.021949761210171267], ["man", 0.021904792083789405], ["money", 0.021369685363573736], ["held", 0.021369685363573736], ["sister", 0.021369685363573736], ["stopped", 0.020836067312416825], ["front", 0.020342014164725346], ["husband", 0.01988206168814567], ["family", 0.01988206168814567], ["hear", 0.019047640735118963], ["kind", 0.019047640735118963], ["year", 0.01866658464285264], ["mind", 0.01866658464285264], ["room", 0.017964181205133795], ["night", 0.017638913444004253], ["turned", 0.01703243492263274], ["left", 0.01703243492263274], ["feet", 0.016748704159840765], ["big", 0.015963483922131545], ["work", 0.015963483922131545], ["asked", 0.015726665970762804], ["wanted", 0.015487090828917244], ["dead", 0.0152610804844127], ["thought", 0.014426659531385994], ["breed", 0.013862943611198907], ["father", 0.012557979763691603], ["newt", 0.010004698081984233], ["good", 0.0094246222353867], ["people", 0.00831805465222496]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\n\u201cThe last I saw of that poor, queer kid was when he came out through that cemetery gate. His father\u2019s funeral was still going on. The old man wasn\u2019t underground yet, and out through that gate came Frank. He raised his thumb at the first car that came by. It was a new Pontiac with a Florida license plate. It stopped. Frank got in it, and that was the last anybody in Ilium ever saw of him.\u201d\n\u201cI hear he\u2019s wanted by the police.\u201d\n\u201cThat was an accident, a freak. Frank wasn\u2019t any criminal. He didn\u2019t have that kind of nerve. The only work he was any good at was model-making. The only job he ever held onto was at Jack\u2019s Hobby Shop, selling models, making models, giving people advice on how to make models. When he cleared out of here, went to Florida, he got a job in a model shop in Sarasota. Turned out the model shop was a front for a ring that stole Cadillacs, ran \u2019em straight on board old L.S.T.\u2019s and shipped \u2018em to Cuba. That\u2019s how Frank got balled up in all that. I expect the reason the cops haven\u2019t found him is he\u2019s dead. He just heard too much while he was sticking turrets on the battleship Missouri with Duco Cement.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Newt now, do you know?\u201d\n\u201cGuess he\u2019s with his sister in Indianapolis. Last I heard was he got mixed up with that Russian midget and flunked out of pre-med at Cornell. Can you imagine a midget trying to become a doctor? And, in that same miserable family, there\u2019s that great big, gawky girl, over six feet tall. That man, who\u2019s so famous for having a great mind, he pulled that girl out of high school in her sophomore year so he could go on having some woman take care of him. All she had going for her was the clarinet she\u2019d played in the Ilium High School band, the Marching Hundred.\n\u201cAfter she left school,\u201d said Breed, \u201cnobody ever asked her out.

Neither did I say that free-lance prostitutes were sometimes found there, and in the past had been the cause of outbreaks of venereal disease on campus.\nI had kept it simple for the freshmen: \u201cTarkingtonians are more than welcome anywhere in town but the Black Cat Caf\u00e9.\u201d\nIF KIMBERLEY RECORDED that good advice, her father did not play it back for me. He didn\u2019t even play back what Slazinger had said to me, and it was during a coffee break, that stimulated me to name the planet\u2019s two most acceptable currencies. He was the agent provocateur.\nWhat he said, as I recall, was, \u201cThey want to get paid in Yen?\u201d He was as new to Scipio as any freshman, and we had just met. I hadn\u2019t read any of his books, and so far as I knew, neither had anybody else on the faculty. He was a last-minute choice for Writer in Residence, and had come to orientation because he was lonesome and had nothing else to do. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be there, and he was so old, so old! He had been sitting among all those teenagers as though he were just another rich kid who had bottomed out on his Scholastic Aptitude Test, and he was old enough to be their grandfather!\nHe had fought in World War II! That\u2019s how old he was.\nSo I said to him, \u201cThey\u2019ll take dollars if they have to, but you\u2019d better have a wheelbarrow.\u201d\nAnd he wanted to know if the merchants and tradespeople would also accept fellatio. He used a vernacular word for fellatio in the plural.\nBut the tape began right after that, with my saying, as though out of the blue, and as a joke, of course, only it didn\u2019t sound like a joke during the playback, that, in effect, the whole World was for sale to anyone who had Yen or was willing to perform fellatio.\n14\nSO THAT WAS twice within an hour that I was accused of cynicism that was Paul Slazinger\u2019s, not mine. And he was in Key West, well out of reach of punishment, having been unemployment-proofed for 5 years with a Genius Grant from the MacArthur Foundation.
