But Constant and Beatrice had agreed that their son, with most of his life ahead of him, should live that life with busy and jolly contemporaries on Earth.\nBy the time Constant was seventy-four, however, getting young Chrono back to Earth was no longer a pressing problem. Young Chrono was no longer particularly young. He was forty-two. And he had made such a thorough and specialized adjustment on Titan that it would have been cruel in the extreme to send him anywhere else.\nAt the age of seventeen, young Chrono had run away from his palatial home to join the Titanic bluebirds, the most admirable creatures on Titan. Chrono now lived among their nests by the Kazak Pools. He wore their feathers and sat on their eggs and shared their food and spoke their language.\nConstant never saw Chrono. Sometimes, late at night, he would hear Chrono\u2019s cries. Constant did not answer the cries. The cries were for nothing and nobody on Titan.\nThey were for Phoebe, a passing moon.\nSometimes, when Constant was out gathering Titanic strawberries or the speckled, two-pound eggs of the Titanic plover, he would come upon a little shrine made of sticks and stones in a clearing. Chrono made hundreds of these shrines.\nThe elements in the shrines were always the same. One large stone was at the center, representing Saturn. A wooden hoop made of a green twig was placed around it\u2014to represent Saturn\u2019s rings. And beyond the rings were small stones to represent the nine moons. The largest of these satellite stones was Titan. And there was always the feather of a Titanic bluebird under it.\nThe marks on the ground made it clear that young Chrono, no longer so young, spent hours moving the elements of the system about.\nWhen old Malachi Constant found one of his strange son\u2019s shrines in a state of neglect, he would tidy it up as best he could. Constant would weed it and rake it, and make a new twig ring for the stone that was Saturn. He would put a fresh bluebird feather under the stone that was Titan.", 0.0812394127611519], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["fourteenth", 0.102477740314385], ["comment", 0.09032316594165174], ["pah", 0.09032316594165174], ["soviet", 0.09032316594165174], ["bedroom", 0.08915355488735112], ["defense", 0.07932082974228753], ["pool", 0.05943570325823408], ["mankind", 0.05377419621158753], ["ice", 0.052234568877561435], ["states", 0.050880203246604125], ["united", 0.04960968407718291], ["infested", 0.04516158297082587], ["thoughtful", 0.04516158297082587], ["consists", 0.04516158297082587], ["ballet", 0.04516158297082587], ["fences", 0.04516158297082587], ["bedrooms", 0.04516158297082587], ["republics", 0.04516158297082587], ["homicidal", 0.04516158297082587], ["translates", 0.04516158297082587], ["uninteresting", 0.04516158297082587], ["troll", 0.04516158297082587], ["electrified", 0.04516158297082587], ["exceeds", 0.04516158297082587], ["period", 0.04516158297082587], ["awaited", 0.04516158297082587], ["tools", 0.04516158297082587], ["wrath", 0.04516158297082587], ["understandably", 0.04516158297082587], ["playthings", 0.04516158297082587], ["shepherds", 0.04516158297082587], ["socialist", 0.04516158297082587], ["russia", 0.04516158297082587], ["entirety", 0.04516158297082587], ["entitled", 0.04516158297082587], ["bokonon", 0.04487915350184143], ["book", 0.044849927727470006], ["point", 0.04444424914964913], ["hope", 0.04358603928821619], ["read", 0.03987786704723992], ["winsome", 0.039660414871143766], ["oblivion", 0.039660414871143766], ["humans", 0.039660414871143766], ["violet", 0.039660414871143766], ["velvet", 0.039660414871143766], ["surrounded", 0.039660414871143766], ["sighted", 0.039660414871143766], ["shit", 0.039660414871143766], ["slammed", 0.039660414871143766], ["return", 0.036442437822666277], ["bowed", 0.036442437822666277], ["explanation", 0.036442437822666277], ["plant", 0.036442437822666277], ["ukrainian", 0.036442437822666277], ["men", 0.03581543253712562], ["newt", 0.03573106457851512], ["zinka", 0.03415924677146167], ["gathered", 0.03415924677146167], ["experience", 0.03415924677146167], ["union", 0.03415924677146167], ["storm", 0.03415924677146167], ["stole", 0.03415924677146167], ["humble", 0.03415924677146167], ["clean", 0.03238826620547587], ["indianapolis", 0.030941269722984166], ["german", 0.02971785162911704], ["america", 0.02971785162911704], ["hoenikkers", 0.02971785162911704], ["republic", 0.028658078671779556], ["power", 0.028658078671779556], ["women", 0.028658078671779556], ["angela", 0.02791323526348785], ["remembered", 0.027723292674506673], ["weren", 0.027723292674506673], ["short", 0.026887098105793764], ["closed", 0.026130668107346742], ["husband", 0.023669121057316268], ["door", 0.022675762779903526], ["tells", 0.022222124574824566], ["earth", 0.02138593000611166], ["word", 0.02138593000611166], ["night", 0.02099870648095744], ["books", 0.02027670824122945], ["felix", 0.02027670824122945], ["heard", 0.02027670824122945], ["years", 0.01993893352361996], ["long", 0.01930367393890935], ["children", 0.018715515429752826], ["head", 0.018715515429752826], ["frank", 0.018548744083730476], ["eyes", 0.01717459468022142], ["thought", 0.01717459468022142], ["three", 0.016944534863767034], ["wasn", 0.015688788790632957], ["god", 0.013214347330070722], ["lorenzo", 0.012406548168880704], ["hoenikker", 0.01227956133279784], ["san", 0.011557563093069847], ["man", 0.008692377811027541]], "sentiment": ["\u201cSOMETIMES THE POOL-PAH,\u201d Bokonon tells us, \u201cexceeds the power of humans to comment.\u201d Bokonon translates pool-pah at one point in The Books of Bokonon as \u201cshit storm\u201d and at another point as \u201cwrath of God.\u201d\nFrom what Frank had said before he slammed the door, I gathered that the Republic of San Lorenzo and the three Hoenikkers weren\u2019t the only ones who had ice-nine.

He leaned back, propped his feet on his desk top, and stuffed a cigar, which he\u2019d concealed in his cupped hand, into his large mouth. \"Hell\u2014thought you were a scoutmaster.\" He looked at his desk clock, which was mounted in a miniature of the company\u2019s newest automatic dishwasher. \"Boy scouts touring the Works. Supposed to stop in here fifteen minutes ago for me to give \u2019em a talk on scouting and industry. Fifty-six per cent of Federal Apparatus\u2019 executives were eagle scouts.\"\nDavid started to laugh, but found himself doing it all alone, and he stopped. \"Amazing figure,\" he said.\n\"It is,\" said Flammer judiciously. \"Says something for scouting and something for industry. Now, before I tell you where your desk is, I\u2019m supposed to explain the rating-sheet system. That\u2019s what the Manual says. Dilling tell you about that?\"\n\"Not that I recall. There was an awful lot of information all at once.\"\n\"Well, there\u2019s nothing much to it,\" said Flammer. \"Every six months a rating sheet is made out on you, to let you and to let us know just where you stand, and what sort of progress you\u2019ve been making. Three people who\u2019ve been close to your work make out independent ratings of you, and then all the information is brought together on a master copy\u2014with carbons for you, me, and Personnel, and the original for the head of the Advertising and Sales Promotion Division. It\u2019s very helpful for everybody, you most of all, if you take it the right way.\" He waved a rating sheet before David. \"See? Blanks for appearance, loyalty, promptness, initiative, cooperativeness\u2014things like that. You\u2019ll make out rating sheets on other people, too, and whoever does the rating is anonymous.\"\n\"I see.\" David felt himself reddening with resentment. He fought the emotion, telling himself his reaction was a small-town man\u2019s\u2014 and that it would do him good to learn to think as a member of a great, efficient team.\n\"Now about pay, Potter,\" said Flammer, \"there\u2019ll never be any point in coming in to ask me for a raise. That\u2019s all done on the basis of the rating sheets and the salary curve.\" He rummaged through his drawers and found a graph, which he spread out on his desk. \"Here\u2014now you see this curve? Well, it\u2019s the average salary curve for men with college educations in the company. See\u2014you can follow it on up. At thirty, the average man makes this much; at forty, this much\u2014and so on. Now, this curve above it shows what men with real growth potential can make. See? It\u2019s a little higher and curves upward a little faster. You\u2019re how old?\"\n\"Twenty-nine,\" said David, trying to see what the salary figures were that ran along one side of the graph. Flammer saw him doing it, and pointedly kept them hidden with his forearm.\n\"Uh-huh.\" Flammer wet the tip of a pencil with his tongue, and drew a small \"x\" on the graph, squarely astride the average man\u2019s curve. \"There. you are!\"\nDavid looked at the mark, and then followed the curve with his eyes across the paper, over little bumps, up gentle slopes, along desolate plateaus, until it died abruptly at the margin which represented age sixty-five. The graph left no questions to be asked and was deaf to argument. David looked from it to the human being he would also be dealing with. \"You had a weekly once, did you, Mr. Flammer?\"", 0.0825980392156863], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["joe", 0.31204939495545975], ["cunningham", 0.16712904184811211], ["abekian", 0.1599771226592617], ["dr", 0.11193517357455823], ["dressed", 0.11141936123207476], ["doctor", 0.10480325712625012], ["block", 0.10060695834919037], ["rueful", 0.07419360543096926], ["bitterness", 0.07419360543096926], ["heck", 0.07419360543096926], ["dimple", 0.07419360543096926], ["wife", 0.0653077909839347], ["startling", 0.06495164302350331], ["actor", 0.06495164302350331], ["glass", 0.06477403177049451], ["buzzer", 0.05954544158206112], ["mistaken", 0.05954544158206112], ["specialist", 0.05954544158206112], ["image", 0.05570968061603738], ["specialized", 0.05570968061603738], ["taxicab", 0.05570968061603738], ["accident", 0.05570968061603738], ["heard", 0.054350930205507526], ["sharp", 0.05273443326518125], ["backed", 0.05273443326518125], ["barbara", 0.05273443326518125], ["closer", 0.050303479174595184], ["kids", 0.050303479174595184], ["rang", 0.048248136776898404], ["crossed", 0.048248136776898404], ["marvelous", 0.046467718208571436], ["innocent", 0.046467718208571436], ["heels", 0.04489727773315299], ["married", 0.04489727773315299], ["tiny", 0.04222166846032431], ["surprised", 0.04222166846032431], ["waiting", 0.04106151676712924], ["smile", 0.03900617436943247], ["case", 0.03808626941627311], ["window", 0.0372257558011055], ["children", 0.0364174275102197], ["moment", 0.03493441904208337], ["room", 0.027573504611416177], ["long", 0.025692456634617437], ["turned", 0.024679311208245146], ["house", 0.02404427055505508], ["wasn", 0.023145053477781317], ["woman", 0.0220332986919273], ["told", 0.021256379916940956], ["going", 0.018535108499027418], ["looked", 0.017171390510755176], ["man", 0.012658665206419121]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWhat the heck is it but an accident, who can have kids and who can\u2019t?\u201d said Joe.\nJoe came closer to Dr. Abekian and the glass block window, was surprised to see in every dimple of every glass block a tiny image of his wife, Barbara, getting out of a taxicab. \u201cThat\u2019s my wife,\u201d said Joe.\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Dr. Abekian.\n\u201cYou know?\u201d said Joe.\n\u201cYou can get dressed, Mr. Cunningham,\u201d said the doctor.\n\u201cDressed?\u201d said Joe. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even looked at me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d said Dr. Abekian. \u201cI don\u2019t have to look at you to tell you that, as long as you\u2019re married to that woman, you can never have children.\u201d He turned on Joe with startling bitterness. \u201cAre you a marvelous actor, Mr. Cunningham?\u201d he said. \u201cOr are you really as innocent as you seem?\u201d\nJoe backed away. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, if that\u2019s what you mean,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou came to the right doctor, Mr. Cunningham,\u201d said Dr. Abekian.

One year after Kurt entrusted him with this information, he published the third of his books on Vonnegut, Vonnegut in America: An Introduction to the Life and Work of Kurt Vonnegut.\nDear Jerry\u2014\nSome second thoughts about the biographical stuff you sent me:\nIn the chronology, for the sake of completeness, it should be said that in 1971 I separated permanently from my wife and took up residence in New York City.\nAlso: It is not known why my mother killed herself. She never said anything about the awfulness of fighting against the homeland or anything like that. In fact, I don\u2019t recall my parents\u2019 ever having spoken of Germany as the homeland. When I was captured by the Germans, and they asked me why I was fighting against my brothers, I thought it was hilarious. I felt no more closely related to them than I was to Bolivians.\nIt was war itself that wrecked my mother, and not war against Germany. Also, she was taking an awful lot of barbiturates at a time when the side-effects were thought to be negligible.\nAs for the sequence of houses we lived in: the Chamber of Commerce magazine got the order all ass-backwards, and I guess you got it from them. The truth is that the family moved into a perfectly beautiful house in 1922, when I was born. It required many servants. Father was its architect, and it is the most interesting thing he ever did. Evans Woollen, Jr., the hottest young architect in town these days, honored father by making it his own home a few years ago. It is at Forty-fourth and North Illinois Streets.\nAfter we went dead broke in the thirties, Father wanted to sell it right away, but couldn\u2019t find a buyer until 1939. His idea was to build a wonderful but much cheaper house on a gorgeous lot he had bought in the twenties in the posh suburb of Williams Creek. The suburb remains posh. We moved into a sort of blue collar house on Forty-second Street, almost on North Illinois, while he and Mother gathered resources which would allow them to build the new dream house.", 0.18381132756132756], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["kill", 0.3684072535967563], ["prevent", 0.2998470256055476], ["plan", 0.2998470256055476], ["hero", 0.2268841644939744], ["beg", 0.2268841644939744], ["suppose", 0.2268841644939744], ["honor", 0.2151397670563844], ["case", 0.20554389564617628], ["killing", 0.20554389564617628], ["live", 0.19743070197105742], ["hate", 0.17865833650059781], ["life", 0.14772219624259156], ["years", 0.13482101424085552], ["penelope", 0.06480938121273067], ["harold", 0.03683079181259911]], "sentiment": ["So he can kill you.
