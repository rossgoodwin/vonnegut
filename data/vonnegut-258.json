But the class of the damaged and roughly-used old lady showed through.\nTo anyone with a sense of poetry, mortality, and wonder, Malachi Constant\u2019s proud, high-cheekboned mate was as handsome as a human being could be.\nShe was probably a little crazy. On a moon with only two other people on it, she was writing a book called The True Purpose of Life in the Solar System. It was a refutation of Rumfoord\u2019s notion that the purpose of human life in the Solar System was to get a grounded messenger from Tralfamadore on his way again.\nBeatrice began the book after her son left her to join the bluebirds. The manuscript so far, written in longhand, occupied thirty-eight cubic feet inside the Taj Mahal.\nEvery time Constant visited her, she read aloud her latest additions to the manuscript.\nShe was reading out loud now, sitting in Rumfoord\u2019s old contour chair while Constant puttered about the courtyard. She was wearing a pink and white chenille bedspread that had come with the palace. Worked into the tufts of the bedspread was the message, God does not care.\nIt had been Rumfoord\u2019s own personal bedspread.\nOn and on Beatrice read, spinning arguments against the importance of the forces of Tralfamadore.\nConstant did not listen attentively. He simply enjoyed Beatrice\u2019s voice, which was strong and triumphant. He was down in a manhole by the pool, turning a valve that would drain the water out. The water of the pool had been turned into something like cream of pea soup by Titanic algae. Every time Constant visited Beatrice he fought a losing battle against the prolific green murk.\n\" \u2019I would be the last to deny,\u2019 \" said Beatrice, reading her own work out loud, \" \u2019that the forces of Tralfamadore have had something to do with the affairs of Earth. However, those persons who have served the interests of Tralfamadore have served them in such highly personalized ways that Tralfamadore can be said to have had practically nothing to do with the case.\u2019 \"", 0.09665849673202616], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["dishrag", 0.31232576711025717], ["reticule", 0.19132279856899795], ["newt", 0.1250587260248029], ["gold", 0.11284118477013201], ["pan", 0.10410858903675238], ["mesh", 0.10410858903675238], ["mother", 0.08420709939906466], ["finely", 0.05927457764920896], ["creaked", 0.05927457764920896], ["snaky", 0.05927457764920896], ["peeled", 0.05927457764920896], ["treasured", 0.05927457764920896], ["frosting", 0.05927457764920896], ["tossed", 0.05927457764920896], ["carelessness", 0.05927457764920896], ["sopping", 0.05927457764920896], ["bag", 0.05927457764920896], ["decorate", 0.05927457764920896], ["cake", 0.05927457764920896], ["woven", 0.05927457764920896], ["angela", 0.05495418192499171], ["sentimentally", 0.05205429451837619], ["metallic", 0.05205429451837619], ["quality", 0.05205429451837619], ["broom", 0.05205429451837619], ["assumed", 0.05205429451837619], ["puddles", 0.05205429451837619], ["surface", 0.05205429451837619], ["counter", 0.05205429451837619], ["leaning", 0.05205429451837619], ["labrador", 0.04783069964224949], ["retriever", 0.04783069964224949], ["wiped", 0.04783069964224949], ["reminded", 0.044834011387543435], ["asleep", 0.044834011387543435], ["contained", 0.044834011387543435], ["kitchen", 0.044834011387543435], ["gathered", 0.044834011387543435], ["evening", 0.044834011387543435], ["sleeping", 0.04250959939468708], ["wicker", 0.04250959939468708], ["peculiar", 0.04250959939468708], ["sound", 0.04250959939468708], ["explained", 0.04061041651141672], ["father", 0.03924368676153626], ["bedroom", 0.039004680263216115], ["minute", 0.039004680263216115], ["eat", 0.039004680263216115], ["tree", 0.039004680263216115], ["dog", 0.037613728256710666], ["reason", 0.035289316263854315], ["child", 0.035289316263854315], ["talked", 0.033390133380583956], ["held", 0.033390133380583956], ["fell", 0.033390133380583956], ["chair", 0.031784397132383346], ["felt", 0.031065721387727604], ["floor", 0.02976193864862338], ["happened", 0.029166538504457246], ["sort", 0.028603338282891872], ["christmas", 0.028069033133021552], ["water", 0.02756080225625664], ["find", 0.026613179566613653], ["frank", 0.02434522660989625], ["making", 0.02419857942018319], ["dead", 0.023845438256894842], ["ice", 0.022852623883933127], ["thought", 0.022541655517790613], ["wasn", 0.020591535287705756], ["papa", 0.01697829628935043], ["man", 0.011408745876973648]], "sentiment": ["NEWT\u2019S MOTHER\u2019S RETICULE\n\u201cI SHOULD HAVE KNOWN he was dead the minute I came in,\u201d said Angela, leaning on her broom again. \u201cThat wicker chair, it wasn\u2019t making a sound.

Everyone heard it, the ugliest word in the language, one that permitted no muttering withdrawal, no shaking of hands and forgetting it. Son-of-a-bitch could be softened with a smile, but not saboteur.\nSomehow the idea of a wrecker of machines had become the smallest part of the word, like the crown of an iceberg. The greatest part of its mass, the part that called forth such poisonous emotions, was undefined: an amalgam of perversions, filth, disease, a galaxy of traits, any one of which would make a man a despicable outcast. The saboteur wasn\u2019t a wrecker of machines but an image every man prided himself on being unlike. The saboteur was the man who, if dead, would no longer make the world a trying place to live in.\n\u201cYou want me to say it again?\u201d said the bartender. \u201cSaboteur. You\u2019re a stinking saboteur.\u201d\nIt was an electrifying situation, an elemental situation. Here one big man had offered the ultimate insult to another big man. No one looked as though he were willing to bring the drama to an end, or as though he thought he could. It was like seeing a man caught in a threshing machine, beyond saving. As long as God had precipitated the tragedy, the onlookers might as well watch and learn what a threshing machine would do to a man once it caught him.\nPaul hadn\u2019t hit anyone since his sophomore year in high school. He had none of what bayonet instructors hoped to instill in their pupils, the will to close with the enemy. It was an unpromising sort of will, he thought. Still, obedient to some system of involuntary nerves and glands, his hands tightened into fists, and his feet spaced themselves to form a solid bipod from which to swing.\nJust as there is no encore for the 1812 Overture save \u201cThe Stars and Stripes Forever,\u201d so Paul had no choice of rejoinders. \u201cSaboteur yourself,\u201d he said evenly, and swung at the bartender\u2019s nose.\nAbsurdly, the bartender collapsed, snuffling and snorting. Paul walked out into the night, like Wild Bill Hickock, like Dan\u2019l Boone, like the bargeman on the book jacket, like\u2014He was suddenly spun around again. For a split second, he saw the bartender\u2019s red nose, white face, white apron, and white fist. A brilliant flash illuminated the inside of his skull, and then midnight.\n\u201cDoctor Proteus\u2014Paul.\u201d\nPaul opened his eyes to find himself staring up at the Big Dipper. A cool breeze played across his aching head, and he couldn\u2019t see where the voice was coming from. Someone had stretched him out on the cement bench that ran the length of the dock, to be loaded with the band and the outgoing mail aboard the last boat for the Mainland.", 0.11282828282828283], "title": "Player Piano"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["david", 0.16608320918399405], ["badge", 0.15047428063989435], ["ray", 0.1003161870932629], ["dunkel", 0.1003161870932629], ["spectrogoniometer", 0.1003161870932629], ["potter", 0.077187507331829], ["build", 0.077187507331829], ["dr", 0.07113104264863361], ["examining", 0.061722433427348386], ["spotlighted", 0.061722433427348386], ["platform", 0.061722433427348386], ["crystallographers", 0.061722433427348386], ["toothed", 0.061722433427348386], ["steered", 0.061722433427348386], ["conditioning", 0.061722433427348386], ["stack", 0.061722433427348386], ["telephone", 0.05485336079108663], ["stan", 0.05442614731619107], ["hammer", 0.05442614731619107], ["permitted", 0.05442614731619107], ["maid", 0.05442614731619107], ["lobby", 0.05442614731619107], ["studded", 0.05442614731619107], ["auditorium", 0.05442614731619107], ["revolving", 0.05442614731619107], ["crane", 0.05442614731619107], ["lettered", 0.05442614731619107], ["dials", 0.05015809354663145], ["switches", 0.05015809354663145], ["chose", 0.05015809354663145], ["mounted", 0.05015809354663145], ["cupped", 0.05015809354663145], ["plates", 0.05015809354663145], ["aching", 0.05015809354663145], ["receptionist", 0.05015809354663145], ["bald", 0.05015809354663145], ["tray", 0.05015809354663145], ["display", 0.05015809354663145], ["ringing", 0.047129861205033756], ["offering", 0.047129861205033756], ["crashed", 0.047129861205033756], ["grinning", 0.047129861205033756], ["martini", 0.04478098171751576], ["chest", 0.04478098171751576], ["overhead", 0.04478098171751576], ["sales", 0.04478098171751576], ["headed", 0.04123916870045036], ["group", 0.03983357509387643], ["box", 0.03983357509387643], ["steel", 0.03983357509387643], ["ear", 0.0385937536659145], ["doors", 0.037484695606358434], ["wearing", 0.037484695606358434], ["peace", 0.03648143055578659], ["ears", 0.03648143055578659], ["man", 0.03505392582605471], ["sitting", 0.034722966506700634], ["shouted", 0.034722966506700634], ["corner", 0.03394288258929303], ["door", 0.033409790664885086], ["dropped", 0.03253728898271912], ["caught", 0.03253728898271912], ["nodded", 0.03253728898271912], ["hung", 0.031899135068861904], ["street", 0.03018840949520112], ["today", 0.029674828819733413], ["afraid", 0.028717231154409974], ["turn", 0.02702941378519756], ["walked", 0.026646596478135713], ["air", 0.024297716990617717], ["hands", 0.022632201146250412], ["sir", 0.02237854270857609], ["big", 0.018624069614484175], ["men", 0.018450076962366165], ["find", 0.017781514796868], ["left", 0.0174625111179698], ["head", 0.016275190126966176], ["told", 0.01599816582888856], ["going", 0.012148431308271188]], "sentiment": ["The man nodded.

He was in the lobby of an auditorium, where a group of men were examining a box studded with dials and switches that was spotlighted and mounted on a revolving platform.\n\"Please, miss,\" he said to a receptionist by the door, \"could you tell me where I could find a telephone?\"\n\"It\u2019s right around the corner, sir,\" she said. \"But I\u2019m afraid no one is permitted here today but the crystallographers.
