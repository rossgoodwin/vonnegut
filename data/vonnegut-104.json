in Residence was to steal about eight pounds of this stationery while waiting in Paul Engle\u2019s unguarded office for the great man to show up. When he appeared at last, he proved to be a lean, gray-haired, slightly crooked Supreme Court Justice dressed like Harry Belafonte. His only advice was to buy a season ticket to the football games at a 50% faculty discount, which I did immediately. It cost $15.00. If you would cause the check to bounce, you would be a heroine to Writers in Residence everywhere. Tomorrow we play Washington State. I hope we win.\nTo those, like yourself, who think universities are beautiful, with their chapels and botany buildings and schools of dentistry and all that, this must surely seem a lovely place\u2014and even I am moved. Seriously, folks, I am glad to be back in the Corn Belt again. Word of honor: I like it. Word of honor: it\u2019s good looking as anything. These people are boobs about a lot of things, but they\u2019re just like the Jews when it comes to EDUCATION.\nBut you should see the apartment I have. I don\u2019t recommend that you see it. I opened the door for the first time, and I thought, \u201cMy God, Otis Burger has been here before me!\u201d It has a vileness, a George Price uninhabitability that no amateur could achieve. I must sleep in the very first Hide-a-bed ever created, which was created from the rusty wreckage of the first Stutz Bearcat. Jesus, is it ever a cruel and ugly old bed! I have a bath with a stall shower, a full kitchen, less ice-cube trays, no curtains or windowshades, and this livingroom\u2013bedroom with the hide-a-bed. You wonder what creates beatniks? Landlords! \u201cLive like a pig for $80.00 a month,\u201d say my surroundings. Very well. Very well.\nSo I will write to the Del Prado, and say that we want the same room we had on our honeymoon four years ago. Better there than here, if you want to talk about love somewhere during the proceedings.\nWell\u2014I\u2019m the guy who said that marvelous thing about queer travel suggestions being dancing lessons from God, and here I am, and there you all are. And I love you. What do I have from home? One picture that must stand for you all\u2014my darling Edith\u2019s picture of herself. That\u2019s it.\nK", 0.24080459770114943], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["evolution", 0.06435754009271887], ["birds", 0.06338939450454809], ["tree", 0.05033268195178792], ["riot",

ordinary Dalhousies, indistinguishable from other Dalhousies, but pecking at the backs of deer and moose instead of tree trunks. Such simple pictures would have been exciting enough, showing that lower animals were capable of cultural as well as biological evolution. One might have extrapolated from them the supposition that one bird in the flock was a sort of Albert Einstein, so to speak, having theorized and then proved that blackflies were as nutritious as anything that could be dug out of a tree trunk.\nWas Dr. Trout ever in for a surprise, though! Not only were these birds obscenely fat, and thus easy prey for predators. They were exploding, too! Spores from a tree fungus growing near Dalhousie nests found an opportunity to become a new disease in the intestinal tracts of the overweight birds, thanks to certain chemicals in the bodies of blackflies.\nThe new life-style of the fungus inside the birds at one point triggered the sudden release of quantities of carbon dioxide so copious that the birds blew up! One Dalhousie, perhaps the last veteran of the Disappointment Lake experiment, would explode a year later in a park in Detroit, Michigan, setting off the second-worst race riot in the Motor City\u2019s history.\n49\nTrout wrote a story one time about another race riot. It was on a planet twice as big as Earth, orbiting Puke, a star the size of a BB, two billion years ago.\nI asked my big brother Bernie in the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and this was long before the period of the rerun, whether he believed in Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. He said he did, and I asked how come, and he said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s the only game in town.\u201d\nBernie\u2019s reply is the tag line of yet another joke from long ago, like \u201cTing-a-ling, you son of a bitch!\u201d It seems a guy is off to play cards, and a friend tells him the game is crooked. The guy says, \u201cYeah, I know, but it\u2019s the only game in town.\u201d\nI am too lazy to chase down the exact quotation, but the British astronomer Fred Hoyle said something to this effect: That believing in Darwin\u2019s theoretical mechanisms of evolution was like believing that a hurricane could blow through a junkyard and build a Boeing 747.\nNo matter what is doing the creating, I have to say that the giraffe and the rhinoceros are ridiculous.\nAnd so is the human brain, capable, in cahoots with the more sensitive parts of the body, such as the ding-dong, of hating life while pretending to love it, and behaving accordingly: \u201cSomebody shoot me while I\u2019m happy!\u201d", 0.023960731939455335], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["susanna", 0.14078018857542068], ["hinkley", 0.13139547339993962], ["noon", 0.11310754739916784], ["fuller", 0.08417827309838558], ["grin", 0.07181227770886321], ["firehouse", 0.0590860175439444], ["stool", 0.05655377369958392], ["drugstore", 0.05655377369958392], ["night", 0.052592757279054866], ["cat", 0.04813522087221842], ["spat", 0.04071966094165345], ["railing", 0.04071966094165345], ["attractive", 0.04071966094165345], ["mixture", 0.04071966094165345], ["stools", 0.04071966094165345], ["perfunctory", 0.04071966094165345], ["wheeze", 0.04071966094165345], ["grievances", 0.04071966094165345], ["soreheadedness", 0.04071966094165345], ["rumpling", 0.04071966094165345], ["vandal", 0.04071966094165345], ["screeched", 0.04071966094165345], ["cuckoo", 0.04071966094165345], ["hearselike", 0.04071966094165345], ["shopkeepers", 0.04071966094165345], ["expressmen", 0.04071966094165345], ["fly", 0.04071966094165345], ["monument", 0.04071966094165345], ["paddled", 0.04071966094165345], ["ironically", 0.04071966094165345], ["lackadaisically", 0.04071966094165345], ["corporal", 0.040544336061550786], ["day", 0.039444567959291146], ["righteousness", 0.035906138854431606], ["express", 0.035906138854431606], ["appear", 0.035906138854431606], ["staggered", 0.035906138854431606], ["awake", 0.035906138854431606], ["queasy", 0.035906138854431606], ["arched", 0.035906138854431606], ["idle", 0.035906138854431606], ["guilt", 0.035906138854431606], ["beautiful", 0.03420046936022141], ["stupid", 0.0330904089370138], ["weak", 0.0330904089370138], ["trunk", 0.0330904089370138], ["soda", 0.0330904089370138], ["yankee", 0.0330904089370138], ["fussed", 0.0330904089370138], ["anxiety", 0.0330904089370138], ["reviewing", 0.0330904089370138], ["amazed", 0.0330904089370138], ["moments", 0.031092616767209768], ["jumped", 0.031092616767209768], ["climbed", 0.031092616767209768], ["theater", 0.031092616767209768], ["bait", 0.0295430087719722], ["villagers", 0.0295430087719722], ["bearse", 0.0295430087719722], ["loudly", 0.0295430087719722], ["siren", 0.0295430087719722], ["dawn", 0.02827688684979196], ["drew", 0.02827688684979196], ["porch", 0.02827688684979196], ["hungry", 0.02827688684979196], ["strange", 0.02827688684979196], ["seemingly", 0.02827688684979196], ["row", 0.02720639601765822], ["fountain", 0.02720639601765822], ["drove", 0.02720639601765822], ["twist", 0.02720639601765822], ["disappeared", 0.026279094679987923], ["stairs", 0.026279094679987923], ["grow", 0.026279094679987923], ["truck", 0.024729486684750356], ["empty", 0.02406761043610921], ["papers", 0.02406761043610921], ["thoughts", 0.02406761043610921], ["upstairs", 0.023463364762570115], ["spoke", 0.023463364762570115], ["fire", 0.023463364762570115], ["good", 0.022947025850007102], ["broken", 0.022907512625948336], ["spent", 0.022907512625948336], ["york", 0.022392873930436378], ["change", 0.022392873930436378], ["clock", 0.021913756767332548], ["main", 0.02146557259276608], ["soldier", 0.02146557259276608], ["supposed", 0.02146557259276608], ["top", 0.021044568274596394], ["will", 0.020405305846189697], ["street", 0.019915964597528514], ["question", 0.01957714401301857], ["felt", 0.01894539555325658], ["company", 0.018649842675348274], ["bad", 0.018366356602290943], ["money", 0.01809399053872649], ["women", 0.01809399053872649], ["walked", 0.017579351843214533], ["started", 0.017100234680110706], ["black", 0.01665205050554424], ["open", 0.016231046187374552], ["wouldn", 0.015458645943553551], ["sat", 0.015278260621308683], ["matter", 0.015102442510306673], ["face", 0.013836320588126432], ["great", 0.01328046845150465], ["better", 0.012890958266427959], ["men", 0.012171925773783232], ["door", 0.011020590670708623], ["boy", 0.010830320016624496], ["room", 0.010645123856331708], ["time", 0.007245483402729584]], "sentiment": ["\"She will?\" said Hinkley. \"Maybe she will.

The question was: Had Corporal Fuller broken it or, at noon, would the little door on top fly open, would Susanna appear?\nIn the drugstore, old Bearse Hinkley fussed with Susanna\u2019s New York papers, rumpling them in his anxiety to make them attractive. They were bait for Susanna.\nMoments before noon, Corporal Fuller\u2014the vandal himself\u2014came into the drugstore. On his face was a strange mixture of guilt and soreheadedness. He had spent the better part of the night awake, reviewing his grievances against beautiful women. All they think about is how beautiful they are, he\u2019d said to himself at dawn. They wouldn\u2019t even give you the time of day.\nHe walked along the row of soda-fountain stools and gave each empty stool a seemingly idle twist. He found the stool that had screeched so loudly the day before. He sat down on it, a monument of righteousness. No one spoke to him.\nThe fire siren gave its perfunctory wheeze for noon. And then, hearselike, a truck from the express company drove up to the firehouse. Two men got out and climbed the stairs. Susanna\u2019s hungry black cat jumped to the porch railing and arched its back as the expressmen disappeared into Susanna\u2019s room.

Felix and his wife Genevi\u00e8ve, \u201cAnyface,\u201d were at radio station WOR, I thought. She still had her job as a receptionist there, and Felix was cleaning out his desk there, preparing to move on to bigger things at Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn.\nThey, in turn, had every reason to assume that I would be at the theater, making last-minute changes in the play. I had not told them that I had been barred from there.\nSo I wandered up on the balcony, and I sat on a hard-backed chair there. It must have been something I used to do in the carriage house when I was genuinely innocent and twelve years old\u2014to sit very still on the balcony, and to appreciate every sound that floated up to me. It wasn\u2019t eavesdropping. It was music appreciation.\nAnd thus it was that I overheard the final dissolution of my brother\u2019s second marriage, and some unkind character sketches of Felix and myself and our parents and Genevi\u00e8ve, and some others I did not know. Genevi\u00e8ve came bursting into the apartment first, so angry that she was spitting like a cat, and then, half a minute later, Felix entered. She had come in one cab, and he had chased her in another. And down below me, and out of my line of sight, an acrimonious, atonal duet for viola and string bass was improvised. They both had such noble voices. She was the viola, and he was the bass.\nOr maybe it was a comedy. Maybe it is amusing when physically attractive, well-to-do great apes in an urban setting hate each other so much:\nDUPLEX\nA NEW COMEDY\nBY RUDY WALTZ.\nThe curtain rises on a Greenwich Village duplex, severely modern, expensive, white. There are fresh flowers. There is fresh fruit. There is impressive electronic apparatus for reproducing music. GENEVIEVE WALTZ, a beautiful young woman whose features must be painted on like those of a China doll, enters through the front door, terminally furious. Her young and successful husband, FELIX, wearing clothes made in London, follows almost at once. He is just as mad. On the balcony sits RUDY WALTZ, a neutered pharmacist from Ohio, FELIX\u2019S kid brother. He is large and good-looking, but is so sexless and shy that he might as well be made out of canned tuna fish. Incredibly, he has written a play which is going to open in a few hours. He knows it is no good. He considers himself a big mistake. He considers life a big mistake. It probably shouldn\u2019t be going on. It is all he can do to give life the benefit of the doubt. There is a frightful secret in his past, which he and his brother have withheld from GENEVIEVE, that he is a murderer. All three are products of public school systems in the Middle West, although GENEVIEVE now sounds vaguely British, and FELIX sounds like a Harvard-educated secretary of state. Only RUDY is still a twanging hick.\nGENEVIEVE: Leave me alone.

the railroad yard. They were wearing new uniforms. They had been sworn into the army the day before. They were boys and men past middle age, and two veterans who had been shot to pieces in Russia. Their assignment was to guard one hundred American prisoners of war, who would work as contract labor. A grandfather and his grandson were in the squad. The grandfather was an architect.\nThe eight were grim as they approached the boxcars containing their wards. They knew what sick and foolish soldiers they themselves appeared to be. One of them actually had an artificial leg, and carried not only a loaded rifle but a cane. Still\u2014they were expected to earn obedience and respect from tall, cocky, murderous American infantrymen who had just come from all the killing at the front.\nAnd then they saw bearded Billy Pilgrim in his blue toga and silver shoes, with his hands in a muff. He looked at least sixty years old. Next to Billy was little Paul Lazzaro with a broken arm. He was fizzing with rabies. Next to Lazzaro was the poor old high school teacher, Edgar Derby, mournfully pregnant with patriotism and middle age and imaginary wisdom. And so on.\nThe eight ridiculous Dresdeners ascertained that these hundred ridiculous creatures really were American fighting men fresh from the front. They smiled, and then they laughed. Their terror evaporated. There was nothing to be afraid of. Here were more crippled human beings, more fools like themselves. Here was light opera.\nSo out of the gate of the railroad yard and into the streets of Dresden marched the light opera. Billy Pilgrim was the star. He led the parade. Thousands of people were on the sidewalks, going home from work. They were watery and putty-colored, having eaten mostly potatoes during the past two years. They had expected no blessings beyond the mildness of the day. Suddenly\u2014here was fun.\nBilly did not meet many of the eyes that found him so entertaining. He was enchanted by the architecture of the city. Merry amoretti wove garlands above windows. Roguish fauns and naked nymphs peeked down at Billy from festooned cornices. Stone monkeys frisked among scrolls and seashells and bamboo.\nBilly, with his memories of the future, knew that the city would be smashed to smithereens and then burned\u2014in about thirty more days. He knew, too, that most of the people watching him would soon be dead. So it goes.\nAnd Billy worked his hands in his muff as he marched. His fingertips, working there in the hot darkness of the muff, wanted to know what the two lumps in the lining of the little impresario\u2019s coat were. The fingertips got inside the lining. They palpated the lumps, the pea-shaped thing and the horseshoe-shaped thing. The parade had to halt by a busy corner. The traffic light was red.\nThere at the corner, in the front rank of pedestrians, was a surgeon who had been operating all day. He was a civilian, but his posture was military. He had served in two world wars. The sight of Billy offended him, especially after he learned from the guards that Billy was an American. It seemed to him that Billy was in abominable taste, supposed that Billy had gone to a lot of silly trouble to costume himself just so.\nThe surgeon spoke English, and he said to Billy, \u201cI take it you find war a very comical thing.\u201d", 0.003356754356754347], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["signature", 0.22654039931757264], ["smiles", 0.10394916269078254], ["hero", 0.10394916269078254], ["inches", 0.08140136377097273], ["letters", 0.07869370777887197], ["unk", 0.06932967923282003], ["letter", 0.06546694582706596], ["proceed", 0.06460230880134654], ["honed", 0.06460230880134654], ["haste", 0.06460230880134654], ["clumsily", 0.06460230880134654], ["sheep", 0.06460230880134654], ["sentiment", 0.06460230880134654], ["bayonets", 0.06460230880134654], ["faithfully", 0.06460230880134654], ["kindergarten", 0.06460230880134654], ["scree", 0.06460230880134654], ["exuberance", 0.06460230880134654], ["smeary", 0.06460230880134654], ["conditions", 0.06460230880134654], ["literature", 0.06460230880134654], ["sheepish", 0.06460230880134654], ["scraws", 0.06460230880134654], ["murdered", 0.06460230880134654], ["sharpening", 0.06460230880134654], ["written", 0.06407327636002147], ["executed", 0.05663509982939316], ["peculiar", 0.05663509982939316], ["secretly", 0.05663509982939316], ["remain", 0.05663509982939316], ["commit", 0.05663509982939316], ["finest", 0.05197458134539127], ["watchful", 0.05197458134539127], ["fate", 0.05197458134539127], ["expressed", 0.05197458134539127], ["harsh", 0.05197458134539127], ["courageous", 0.05197458134539127], ["knives", 0.05197458134539127], ["block", 0.05197458134539127], ["knowledge", 0.04866789085743976], ["spared", 0.04866789085743976], ["awful", 0.04866789085743976], ["gladly", 0.04866789085743976], ["blade", 0.04866789085743976], ["proper", 0.04610302245152931], ["murder", 0.04610302245152931], ["regiment", 0.044007372373437874], ["orders", 0.04070068188548637], ["killed", 0.04070068188548637], ["jungle", 0.04070068188548637], ["stake", 0.039346853889435984], ["cleaned", 0.03704029417148022], ["wide", 0.03704029417148022], ["barrack", 0.03604016340148448], ["sort", 0.035120132278800155], ["spoke", 0.035120132278800155], ["black", 0.03426831650691829], ["received", 0.03426831650691829], ["filled", 0.032036638180010735], ["sense", 0.031379644917482595], ["ships", 0.031379644917482595], ["stevenson", 0.031379644917482595], ["memory", 0.030758182604031147], ["free", 0.030168604507622515], ["stony", 0.02907308519952683], ["high", 0.02715292330684676], ["times", 0.026301107534964892], ["friend", 0.02589775903138708], ["best", 0.02441256671552494], ["years", 0.019408910724055452], ["three", 0.014378770267242857], ["man", 0.011901533184443426], ["space", 0.010573798849709585]], "sentiment": ["I remain faithfully yours\u2014was the sentiment expressed above the signature.\nThe signature itself filled almost the whole page.

The big problem, again, wasn\u2019t insanity, but that people\u2019s brains were much too big and untruthful to be practical.\nNo single human being could claim credit for that rocket, which was going to work so perfectly. It was the collective achievement of all who had ever put their big brains to work on the problem of how to capture and compress the diffuse violence of which nature was capable, and drop it in relatively small packages on their enemies.\nI myself had had some highly personal experiences with dreams-come-true of that sort in Vietnam\u2014which is to say, with mortars and hand grenades and artillery. Nature could never have been that predictably destructive in such small spaces without the help of humankind.\nI have already told my story about the old woman I shot for throwing a hand grenade. There are plenty of others I could tell, but no explosion I saw or heard about in Vietnam could compare with what happened when that Peruvian rocket put the tip of its nose, that part of its body most richly supplied with exposed nerve endings, into that Ecuadorian radar dish.\nNo one is interested in sculpture these days. Who could handle a chisel or a welding torch with their flippers or their mouths?\nIf there were a monument out here in the islands, though, celebrating a key event in the past, that would be a good one: the moment of mating, right before the explosion, between that rocket and that radar dish.\nInto the lava plinth beneath it these words might be incised, expressing the sentiments of all who had had a hand in the design and manufacture and sale and purchase and launch of the rocket, and of all to whom high explosives were a branch of the entertainment industry:", 0.07547619047619049], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["fred", 0.09231675426864187], ["eye", 0.0885653407343851], ["eyed", 0.06362843611137668], ["gregory", 0.057954672442181276], ["cruises", 0.054466017822041114], ["captive", 0.054466017822041114], ["blond", 0.054466017822041114], ["hunts", 0.054466017822041114], ["tow", 0.054466017822041114], ["captives", 0.054466017822041114], ["handicap", 0.054466017822041114], ["germanic", 0.054466017822041114], ["beck", 0.054466017822041114], ["homosexuals", 0.054466017822041114], ["certainty", 0.054466017822041114], ["resemble", 0.054466017822041114], ["diminished", 0.054466017822041114], ["snapping", 0.054466017822041114], ["cake", 0.054466017822041114], ["parade", 0.04732017059977364], ["sawed", 0.04732017059977364], ["walks", 0.04732017059977364], ["explanation", 0.04732017059977364], ["models", 0.04732017059977364], ["propose", 0.04732017059977364], ["arapahoe", 0.04732017059977364], ["companionship", 0.04732017059977364], ["covering", 0.04732017059977364], ["declaring", 0.04314011793886473], ["fox", 0.04314011793886473], ["fourth", 0.04314011793886473], ["emperor", 0.04314011793886473], ["yacht", 0.04314011793886473], ["virginia", 0.04314011793886473], ["men", 0.04175478743745374], ["parties", 0.04017432337750616], ["manhattan", 0.04017432337750616], ["wonder", 0.04017432337750616], ["experiment", 0.04017432337750616], ["roman", 0.04017432337750616], ["marilee", 0.03945991371666549], ["wondered", 0.037873874394885446], ["relative", 0.037873874394885446], ["curious", 0.037873874394885446], ["walk", 0.037873874394885446], ["ararat", 0.035994270716597256], ["heads", 0.035994270716597256], ["hour", 0.035994270716597256], ["illustration", 0.03440508845033686], ["explain", 0.03181421805568834], ["fields", 0.030728027172617963], ["public", 0.030728027172617963], ["blue", 0.029745447999377502], ["third", 0.028848423494329773], ["piece", 0.028848423494329773], ["couple", 0.028023240940994346], ["won", 0.02588262893297121], ["today", 0.025257632831770852], ["feel", 0.024668370833420866], ["jones", 0.024668370833420866], ["serious", 0.024668370833420866], ["mind", 0.024110976799706682], ["hand", 0.024110976799706682], ["second", 0.02358217995035049], ["remember", 0.021702576272062298], ["beautiful", 0.021281730967729773], ["call", 0.021281730967729773], ["love", 0.02087739371872687], ["people", 0.02075335277777182], ["looked", 0.01906408787889528], ["story", 0.01906408787889528], ["day", 0.016965129577439203], ["woman", 0.016436332728083012], ["circe", 0.01618176971168743], ["time", 0.015255854566350197], ["will", 0.01455672904979482], ["long", 0.013342470950244475], ["dan", 0.012605780599913083], ["great", 0.012605780599913083], ["asked", 0.011918240656627803], ["berman", 0.010815435300419889]], "sentiment": ["I used to wonder back then what it was like to have one eye instead of two, and experiment by covering one eye with a hand.

It was customary for him to communicate by means of snuffles after sexual intercourse.

A booby trap was an easily hidden explosive device, which blew up when it was accidentally twiddled in some way. One of the virtues of the new type of booby trap was that it could not be smelled by dogs.
