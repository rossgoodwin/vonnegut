Neither do I love to hate anyone, which is quite evident in my life and work.\nSince you are so literal minded, believing, as you seem to, that people at all times should say exactly what they mean or say nothing, I have no hope of explaining to your satisfaction why I said what I said. I was using a form of humor called irony, saying one thing while clearly meaning another. Such humor is not to your taste, and seems dangerous to you. I, on the other hand, would not be able to make my living as a humorist if I could not use irony. It is not a form of lying, and it is not a form of intentional deception, either. It is a matter of saying one thing while clearly saying another.\nBelieve me, if I thought there were any harm in it, I would find some other way to make a living. I expect to hear from you that there is indeed great harm in it, with world tensions so high, and that I had better find some other way to make a living. You may be right. World War Three might well begin with someone\u2019s making a joke, and with a humorless person taking the joke as an intolerable threat and declaring war.\nIf I really hated the Russians, I would have made you feel it that night. I speak ambiguously only to people who have had little experience with humor.\nI have worked hard for peace all my adult life. I am going to the Soviet Union for the second time this fall. My books have all been published there, and I have several Russian friends. I will go over there with the same attitude I tried to express in my statement about hating Russians. My exact meaning was this: I love the Russian people, but I think their leaders have often treated my fellow artists most swinishly, and it makes me mad.\nO.K.?\nCheers\u2014", 0.03154421768707483], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["smashing", 0.47475779054211703], ["shattered", 0.23737889527105852], ["dying", 0.23737889527105852], ["reaction", 0.23737889527105852], ["alley", 0.23737889527105852], ["cat", 0.23737889527105852], ["owner", 0.23737889527105852], ["attenuated", 0.23737889527105852], ["reactions", 0.23737889527105852], ["intestines", 0.23737889527105852], ["broomstick", 0.23737889527105852], ["thrill", 0.20849776274772747], ["box", 0.1916033832432206], ["cried", 0.1916033832432206], ["cigar", 0.1916033832432206], ["violin", 0.13050600537682783], ["hear", 0.12741817320375606], ["years", 0.10673330294067729], ["penelope", 0.07696114019011767], ["harold", 0.01943847345664953]], "sentiment": ["PENELOPE\nHe knows you shattered his violin.\nHAROLD\nI'm dying to hear of his reaction.
