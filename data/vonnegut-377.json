Vonnegut\nJanuary 12, 1996\n[New York City]\nTO SUSAN ABBADUSKY\nSusan Abbadusky was a high school teacher in Monmouth, Illinois, when a student and her parents charged her with having the student read a \u201cpornographic book,\u201d Vonnegut\u2019s Breakfast of Champions. The issue became a local controversy, leading to some parents wanting to remove not only that book but other books they considered unsavory from the local library. Cooler heads prevailed, and Ms. Abbadusky later retired from the high school and now teaches communications at Monmouth College. Now using her former name, Susan Van Kirk, she has written a book about her experiences, called The Education of a Teacher: Including Dirty Books and Pointed Looks.\nDearest (to be mildly pornographic) Susan Abbadusky\u2014\nMy goodness! I would certainly have replied to your excellent letter (and accompanying materials) of December 12, 1995, long before now, if only my publisher hadn\u2019t kept it in dead storage so long. I got it today at noon!\nDuring the past thirty years or so, I have received many letters from teachers and librarians about books by me which have caused teapot tempests or worse in their communities. You win the prize for the best one. The teacher in Drake, North Dakota, who was fired for teaching Slaughterhouse-Five, also had his windows broken and his dog was shot. The ACLU showed up, and sued members of the School Committee personally on his behalf, and he left town with $30,000, and a glowing letter of recommendation addressed to whom it may concern. Ain\u2019t that sweet?\nThe censorship stories are all so regional. The Mason\u2013Dixon Line still matters a lot. In small towns in Dixie, the general population is almost always solidly behind the censors and, of course, the football team. You and your students are lucky to be in Norman Rockwell America, where Jeffersonian debates are possible and usually entertaining. One community banned Slaughterhouse-Five, and a reporter called me to find out what I had to say about it, and I said the head of the School Committee was a piss-ant, and he dropped dead the next day.", 0.07891615737203972], "title": "Letters"}}
