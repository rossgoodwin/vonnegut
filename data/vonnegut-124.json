William Price Fox was a humorist whose novels include Southern Fried and Ruby Red. Both Vonnegut and Yates liked his writing and successfully campaigned for him to be hired to teach at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop.\nDear Bill:\nYates and I would like to get you on the faculty here, so we could have a clear majority in the Writers\u2019 Workshop of people with no fucking degrees whatsoever. I\u2019m one, Yates is two\u2014you\u2019d make three. And the fiction staff is five. But your manuscript arrived in the same mail with your friendly letter, and I\u2019ve weighed it in my hands (the manuscript), and I\u2019ve remembered all that\u2019s gone before, and you\u2019re going to be a blooming culture hero and millionaire. I\u2019ll be frank with you, though: you\u2019ll be short as long as you live. Some people are tall, and other people are medium or short, and that\u2019s the way God wants it. So don\u2019t come crying to me. Some people are both tall and talented, and there you have God again. Take life as it comes. That\u2019s what I do. [\u2026]\nKurt Vonnegut, Jr.\nP.S.

In preparing for it, I have tried to enquire: what great principle or ideal is it that has kept this Union so long together? And I believe that it was not the mere matter of separation of the colonies from the motherland, but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty to the people of this country and hope to all the world. This sentiment was the fulfillment of an ancient dream, which men have held through all time, that they might one day shake off their chains and find freedom in the brotherhood of life. We gained democracy, and now there is the question of whether it is fit to survive.\n\u201cPerhaps we have come to the dreadful day of awakening, and the dream is ended. If so, I am afraid it must be ended forever. I cannot believe that ever again will men have the opportunity we have had. Perhaps we should admit that, and concede that our ideals of liberty and equality are decadent and doomed. I have heard of an eastern monarch who once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence which would be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words, \u2018And this too shall pass away.\u2019\n\u201cThat is a comforting thought in time of affliction\u2014 \u2018And this too shall pass away.\u2019 And yet\u2014let us believe that it is not true! Let us live to prove that we can cultivate the natural world that is about us, and the intellectual and moral world that is within us, so that we may secure an individual, social and political prosperity, whose course shall be forward, and which, while the earth endures, shall not pass away....\n\u201cI commend you to the care of the Almighty, as I hope that in your prayers you will remember me....

He was bursting to explain the moves to her, to make her understand why he had had no choice; but he knew that an explanation would only make the tragedy infintely more cruel for her. Death through a blunder she might be able to understand; but death as a product of cool reason, a step in logic, she could never accept. Rather than accept it, she would have had them all die.\n\"Only Barzov knows,\" he repeated wearily. The bargain was still in force, the price of victory agreed to. Barzov apparently had yet to realize what it was that Kelly was buying with a life.\n\"How do we know Barzov will let us go if we do win?\" said the T-4.\n\"We don\u2019t, soldier. We don\u2019t.\" And then another doubt began to worm into his consciousness. Perhaps he had won no more than a brief reprieve....\nColonel Kelly had lost track of how long they\u2019d waited there on the chessboard for Barzov\u2019s return. His nerves were deadened by surge after surge of remorse and by the steady pressure of terrible responsibility. His consciousness had lapsed into twilight. Margaret slept in utter exhaustion, with Jerry, his life yet to be claimed, in her arms. Paul had curled up on his square, covered by the young corporal\u2019s field jacket. On what had been Jerry\u2019s square, the horse\u2019s carved head snarling as though fire would burst from its nostrils, stood Pi Ying\u2019s black knight.\nKelly barely heard the voice from the balcony\u2014mistook it for another jagged fragment in a nightmare. His mind attached no sense to the words, heard only their sound. And then he opened his eyes and saw Major Barzov\u2019s lips moving. He saw the arrogant challenge in his eyes, understood the words. \"Since so much blood has been shed in this game, it would be a pitiful waste to leave it unresolved.\"\nBarzov settled regally on Pi Ying\u2019s cushions, his black boots crossed. \"I propose to beat you, Colonel, and I will be surprised if you give me trouble. It would be very upsetting to have you win by the transparent ruse that fooled Pi Ying. It isn\u2019t that easy any more. You\u2019re playing me now, Colonel. You won the initiative for a moment. I\u2019ll take it and the game now, without any more delay.\"\nKelly rose to his feet, his great frame monumental above the white chessmen sitting on the squares about him. Major Barzov wasn\u2019t above the kind of entertainment Pi Ying had found so diverting. But Kelly sensed the difference between the major\u2019s demeanor and that of the guerrilla chief. The major was resuming the game, not because he liked it, but because he wanted to prove that he was one hell of a bright fellow, and that the Americans were dirt. Apparently, he didn\u2019t realize that Pi Ying had already lost the game. Either that, or Kelly had miscalculated.\nIn his mind, Kelly moved every piece on the board, driving his imagination to show him the flaw in his plan, if a flaw existed\u2014if the hellish, heartbreaking sacrifice was for nothing. In an ordinary game, with nothing at stake but bits of wood, he would have called upon his opponent to concede, and the game would have ended there. But now, playing for flesh and blood, an aching, ineradicable doubt overshadowed the cleancut logic of the outcome. Kelly dared not reveal that he planned to attack and win in three moves\u2014not until he had made the moves, not until Barzov had lost every chance to exploit the flaw, if there was one.\n\"What about Jerry?\" cried Margaret.", 0.08608333333333333], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["japanese", 0.15420374084842864], ["galahad", 0.10280249389895242],

Barry \u201cMr. Barry,\u201d as though he were older than God. My goodness, he was only about fifty back then\u2014which is my age now. His mother was maybe seventy-five, with eight more years to go until she tried to rescue a bat she found clinging upside down to her living room draperies.\nMr. Barry was a self-educated inventor and super-salesman. He had entered the armaments business more or less by accident. The timer on an automatic washing machine which he had been manufacturing in the old Keedsler Automobile Works turned out to have military applications. It was ideal for timing the release of bombs from airplanes\u2014so as to create a desired pattern of explosions on the ground. When the war was over, orders for much more sophisticated weapons systems started coming in, and Mr. Barry brought in more and more brilliant scientists and engineers and technicians to keep up with the game.\nA lot of them were Japanese. My father played host to the first Italians to settle in Midland City. Mr. Barry brought in the first Japanese.\nI\u2019ll never forget the first Japanese to come into Schramm\u2019s Drugstore when I was on all-night duty there. I have mentioned that the store was a lighthouse for lunatics\u2014and that Japanese was a lunatic of a sort, almost literally a lunatic, since the word \u201clunatic\u201d has to do with craziness and the moon. This Japanese didn\u2019t want to buy anything. He wanted me to come outside and see something wonderful in the moonlight.\nGuess what it was. It was the conical slate roof of my childhood home, only a few blocks away. The peak of the cone, where the cupola used to be, was capped with very light gray tar roofing, with bits of sand stuck to it. In the light of a full moon, it was glittering white\u2014like snow.\nThe Japanese smiled and pointed up at the roof. He had no idea that the building meant anything to me. Here was the thought he wanted to share with me, the only other person awake at the time: \u201cFujiyama,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2014the sacred volcano of Japan.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMr. Barry, like a lot of self-educated people, was full of obscure facts which he had found for himself, and which nobody else seemed to know. He asked me, for instance, if I knew Sir Galahad had been a Jew.\nI said politely that I hadn\u2019t. It was his airplane. I expected to be annoyed by an anti-Semitic joke of some kind. I was mistaken.\n\u201cNot even the Jews know Sir Galahad was a Jew,\u201d he went on. \u201cJesus, yes\u2014Galahad no. Every Jew I meet, I ask him, \u2018How come you people don\u2019t boast more about Sir Galahad?\u2019 And I even tell them where they can check it out, if they want to. \u2018Start with the Holy Grail,\u2019 I say.\u201d", 0.21223611111111107], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["absolute", 0.6452702274694888], ["satisfy", 0.2818617501723947], ["lead", 0.2172374978978],

For years I have been looking for the best joke in the world. I think I know what it is. I will tell it to you, but you have to help me. You have to say, \u2019No,\u2019 when I hold up my hand like this. All right? Don\u2019t let me down.\n\u201cDo you know why cream is so much more expensive than milk?\u201d\n[AUDIENCE: \u201cNO.\u201d]\n\u201cIt is because the cows hate to squat on those little bottles.\n\u201cThat is the best joke I know. One time when I worked for the General Electric Company over in Schenectady, I had to write speeches for company officers. I put that joke about the cows and the little bottles in a speech for a vice-president. He was reading along, and he had never heard the joke before. He couldn\u2019t stop laughing, and he had to be led away from the podium with a nosebleed. I was fired the next day.\n\u201cHow do jokes work? The beginning of each good one challenges you to think. We are such earnest animals. When I asked you about cream, you could not help yourselves. You really tried to think of a sensible answer. Why does a chicken cross the road? Why does a fireman wear red suspenders? Why did they bury George Washington on the side of a hill?\n\u201cThe second part of the joke announces that nobody wants you to think, nobody wants to hear your wonderful answer. You are so relieved to at last meet somebody who doesn\u2019t demand that you be intelligent. You laugh for joy.\n\u201cI have in fact designed this entire speech so as to allow you to be as stupid as you like, without strain, and without penalties of any kind. I have even written a ridiculous song for the occasion. It lacks music, but we are up to our necks in composers here. One is sure to come along.

Many people had taken over San Lorenzo\u2014 had invariably found it lightly held. The reason was simple: God, in His Infinite Wisdom, had made the island worthless.\nHernando Cortes was the first man to have his sterile conquest of San Lorenzo recorded on paper. Cortes and his men came ashore for fresh water in 1519, named the island, claimed it for Emperor Charles the Fifth, and never returned. Subsequent expeditions came for gold and diamonds and rubies and spices, found none, burned a few natives for entertainment and heresy, and sailed on.\n\u201cWhen France claimed San Lorenzo in 1682,\u201d wrote Castle, \u201cno Spaniards complained. When Denmark claimed San Lorenzo in 1699, no Frenchmen complained. When the Dutch claimed San Lorenzo in 1704, no Danes complained. When England claimed San Lorenzo in 1706, no Dutchmen complained. When Spain reclaimed San Lorenzo in 1720, no Englishmen complained. When, in 1786, African Negroes took command of a British slave ship, ran it ashore on San Lorenzo, and proclaimed San Lorenzo an independent nation, an empire with an emperor, in fact, no Spaniards complained.\n\u201cThe emperor was Tum-bumwa, the only person who ever regarded the island as being worth defending. A maniac, Tum-bumwa caused to be erected the San Lorenzo Cathedral and the fantastic fortifications on the north shore of the island, fortifications within which the private residence of the so-called President of the Republic now stands.\n\u201cThe fortifications have never been attacked, nor has any sane man ever proposed any reason why they should be attacked. They have never defended anything. Fourteen hundred persons are said to have died while building them. Of these fourteen hundred, about half are said to have been executed in public for substandard zeal.\u201d\nCastle Sugar came into San Lorenzo in 1916, during the sugar boom of the First World War. There was no government at all. The company imagined that even the clay and gravel fields of San Lorenzo could be tilled profitably, with the price of sugar so high. No one complained.\nWhen McCabe and Johnson arrived in 1922 and announced that they were placing themselves in charge, Castle Sugar withdrew flaccidly, as though from a queasy dream.\n58\nTYRANNY WITH A DIFFERENCE", -0.0076543209876543195], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["barbara", 0.25945468654070847], ["restively", 0.19904206132634877], ["tiring", 0.19904206132634877], ["downstairs", 0.19904206132634877], ["affair", 0.14539413091187872], ["drinking", 0.13417838969117166], ["laugh", 0.12972734327035423], ["martha", 0.12972734327035423], ["shepherd", 0.11877380651760247], ["touch", 0.11621183966674874], ["conversation", 0.11354374941096419], ["promise", 0.11107348367250679], ["screen", 0.11107348367250679], ["bed", 0.10662243725168938], ["women", 0.10089409535413406], ["darling", 0.09600731288107155], ["love", 0.08053045927670162], ["television", 0.0786781309048746], ["suddenly", 0.07778918933546923], ["coming", 0.0760794128558842], ["guess", 0.07142068144337892], ["thought", 0.0583918044871452], ["kroner", 0.046209812037329684], ["anita", 0.046209812037329684], ["looked", 0.04235938246660154], ["going", 0.036535483886310366], ["paul", 0.019862571507931342]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI love you, Anita.\u201d\n\u201cDarling\u2014about Martha and Barbara\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI promise you, I didn\u2019t touch them.\u201d\n\u201cI was going to ask, did anybody see you with them?\u201d\n\u201cI guess they did, but nobody of any importance.

The subject, as stated by Hal Bourbeau of the chemistry department: \u201cDoes the good news about Big Floyd Hires deciding to be a musical genius offset the bad news about Schroeder deciding to withdraw from the field entirely?\u201d\nThe obvious purpose of the debate was to twit Helmholtz.

After the Romans put down the slave revolt led by Spartacus, he said, they crucified 6,000 of the rebels on either side of the Appian Way!\nHe said that the crucifixion of Tex Johnson was unconventional in several ways besides Tex\u2019s being dead or nearly dead when they spiked him to timbers in the stable loft. He hadn\u2019t been whipped. There hadn\u2019t been a cross-beam for him to carry to his place of execution. There was no sign over his head saying what his crime was. And there was no spike in the upright, whose head would abrade his crotch and hindquarters as he turned this way and that in efforts to become more comfortable.\nAs I said at the beginning of this book, if I had been a professional soldier back then, I probably would have crucified people without thinking much about it, if ordered to do so.\nOr I would have ordered underlings to do it, and told them how to do it, if I had been a high-ranking officer.\nI MIGHT HAVE taught recruits who had never had anything to do with crucifixions, who maybe had never even seen one before, a new word from the vocabulary of military science of that time. The word was crurifragium.

Some other subject must have come up right away.\nBut I would tell him now, if he hadn\u2019t been killed while trying to save the horses, that the most important message of a crucifix, to me anyway, was how unspeakably cruel supposedly sane human beings can be when under orders from a superior authority.", 0.07072897340754483], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["sow", 0.18550934657242413], ["falloleen", 0.15259462321029052], ["designed", 0.1344160795110241], ["ear", 0.11949532937623886], ["krummbein", 0.11575618538714731], ["step", 0.11241140711229569], ["dispassionately", 0.09275467328621206], ["appearance", 0.09275467328621206], ["sees", 0.08175233708684784], ["purse", 0.08175233708684784], ["marvelous", 0.08175233708684784], ["designer", 0.08175233708684784], ["silk", 0.08175233708684784], ["dowdy", 0.08175233708684784], ["fingernails", 0.08175233708684784], ["secretarial", 0.08175233708684784], ["tie", 0.08175233708684784], ["spectacular", 0.08175233708684784], ["di", 0.08175233708684784], ["modular", 0.08175233708684784], ["improve", 0.07531638298989285], ["design", 0.07075000088748364], ["lemon", 0.07075000088748364], ["haired", 0.07075000088748364], ["brown", 0.07075000088748364], ["suggestion", 0.06720803975551205], ["greatest", 0.06431404679052864], ["plain", 0.06186721060279439], ["sight", 0.05974766468811943], ["color", 0.057878092693573656], ["fresh", 0.057878092693573656], ["starting", 0.057878092693573656], ["yellow", 0.056205703556147846], ["secretary", 0.054692843559253794], ["bet", 0.053311710591164435], ["chance", 0.05204119142174322], ["sighed", 0.050864874403430176], ["bed", 0.047783032904367355], ["husband", 0.042984923827019204], ["ago", 0.04103885522237901], ["blue", 0.037742992289391], ["feel", 0.03543851594265294], ["hands", 0.03543851594265294], ["year", 0.03268817116052537], ["guess", 0.03233145916287365], ["great", 0.031307038192436014], ["father", 0.030979747919376712], ["long", 0.030979747919376712], ["work", 0.030979747919376712], ["school", 0.03065907002544783], ["told", 0.030344742608048158], ["love", 0.02724460368232172], ["thing", 0.023805380875836123], ["looked", 0.023001512100935255], ["good", 0.018731830522528452], ["time", 0.016370794629507017]], "sentiment": ["\u201cSometimes I feel like I am,\u201d said Falloleen.

They tinkled, stopped, then reluctantly, torpidly, they managed a few tinkles more.\nBunny\u2019s mother used to collect tinkling music boxes, among other things.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nListen: Francine Pefko was at Dwayne\u2019s automobile agency next door. She was catching up on all the work she should have done that afternoon. Dwayne would beat her up very soon.\nAnd the only other person on the property with her as she typed and filed was Wayne Hoobler, the black parolee, who still lurked among the used cars. Dwayne would try to beat him up, too, but Wayne was a genius at dodging blows.\nFrancine was pure machinery at the moment, a machine made of meat\u2014a typing machine, a filing machine.\nWayne Hoobler, on the other hand, had nothing machine-like to do. He ached to be a useful machine. The used cars were all locked up tight for the night. Now and then aluminum propellors on a wire overhead would be turned by a lazy breeze, and Wayne would respond to them as best he could. \u201cGo,\u201d he would say to them. \u201cSpin \u2019roun\u2019.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe established a sort of relationship with the traffic on the Interstate, too, appreciating its changing moods. \u201cEverybody goin\u2019 home,\u201d he said during the rush hour jam. \u201cEverybody home now,\u201d he said later on, when the traffic thinned out.
