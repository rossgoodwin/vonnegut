There she would get the New York papers.\nShe seemed to nod to all the world in a dim, queenly way.

She would pause on the porch outside her room, dip her hand into her bosom, bring out the key, unlock the door, pick up the black cat, kiss it again, and disappear inside.\nThe one-girl pageant had a ritual sameness until one day toward the end of summer, when the air of the drugstore was cut by a cruel, sustained screech from a dry bearing in a revolving soda-fountain stool.\nThe screech cut right through Susanna\u2019s speech about Mr. Hinkley\u2019s being an angel. The screech made scalps tingle and teeth ache. Susanna looked indulgently in the direction of the screech, forgiving the screecher. She found that the screecher wasn\u2019t a person to be indulged.\nThe screech had been made by the stool of Cpl. Norman Fuller, who had come home the night before from eighteen bleak months in Korea. They had been eighteen months without war\u2014but eighteen months without cheer, all the same. Fuller had turned on the stool slowly, to look at Susanna with indignation. When the screech died, the drugstore was deathly still.\nFuller had broken the enchantment of summer by the seaside\u2014had reminded all in the drugstore of the black, mysterious passions that were so often the mainsprings of life.", -0.09981340498581877], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["meat", 0.15253338550226408], ["pour", 0.12711115458522007], ["tablespoons", 0.10168892366817606], ["marinade", 0.096363259007256], ["sauerbraten", 0.08368373741164724], ["pan", 0.08102312219531743], ["crushed", 0.07100421581603848], ["cup", 0.06999909478695018], ["braising", 0.064242172671504], ["vinegar", 0.064242172671504], ["drippings", 0.064242172671504], ["sliced", 0.0557891582744315], ["tablespoon", 0.0557891582744315], ["three", 0.0540045913901478], ["sauce", 0.05084446183408803], ["saucepan", 0.05084446183408803], ["simmer", 0.047336143877358995], ["bowl", 0.047336143877358995], ["wine", 0.047336143877358995], ["contest", 0.044614881056453996], ["mixture", 0.04239144743701553], ["won", 0.040511561097658716], ["hot", 0.03888312948028649], ["turn", 0.03744675099667206], ["labels", 0.032121086335752], ["digest", 0.032121086335752], ["celery", 0.032121086335752], ["cider", 0.032121086335752], ["remove", 0.032121086335752], ["bay", 0.032121086335752], ["portable", 0.032121086335752], ["sear", 0.032121086335752], ["gradually", 0.032121086335752], ["rattletrap", 0.032121086335752], ["excess", 0.032121086335752], ["allspice", 0.032121086335752], ["playwrights", 0.032121086335752], ["beef", 0.032121086335752], ["draft", 0.032121086335752], ["rump", 0.032121086335752], ["browned", 0.032121086335752], ["carrots", 0.032121086335752], ["peppercorns", 0.032121086335752], ["strain", 0.032121086335752], ["rib", 0.032121086335752], ["pecking", 0.032121086335752], ["snaps", 0.032121086335752], ["corona", 0.032121086335752], ["days", 0.031217170219038026], ["announcement", 0.02789457913721575], ["nicely", 0.02789457913721575], ["roast", 0.02789457913721575], ["rolled", 0.02789457913721575], ["dry", 0.02789457913721575], ["ph", 0.02789457913721575], ["complete", 0.02789457913721575], ["typewriter", 0.02789457913721575], ["tied", 0.02789457913721575], ["refrigerate", 0.02789457913721575], ["liquid", 0.02789457913721575], ["blend", 0.02789457913721575], ["caldwell", 0.025422230917044014], ["writing", 0.025422230917044014], ["reading", 0.025422230917044014], ["foundation", 0.025422230917044014], ["ginger", 0.025422230917044014], ["takes", 0.025422230917044014], ["boil", 0.025422230917044014], ["rudolph", 0.025422230917044014], ["stir", 0.025422230917044014], ["half", 0.024509288061485928], ["flour", 0.023668071938679498], ["fat", 0.023668071938679498], ["prize", 0.023668071938679498], ["melt", 0.023668071938679498], ["cloves", 0.023668071938679498], ["leaves", 0.023668071938679498], ["heat", 0.023668071938679498], ["pound", 0.023668071938679498], ["sides", 0.023668071938679498], ["cover", 0.023668071938679498], ["onions", 0.022307440528226998], ["mix", 0.022307440528226998], ["stock", 0.021195723718507763], ["waited", 0.021195723718507763], ["chopped", 0.021195723718507763], ["table", 0.021195723718507763], ["butter", 0.020255780548829358], ["surprise", 0.019441564740143243], ["add", 0.01872337549833603], ["salt", 0.01872337549833603], ["bring", 0.01808093332969075], ["writer", 0.01808093332969075], ["la", 0.01808093332969075], ["deep", 0.01808093332969075], ["uniform", 0.017499773696737546], ["minutes", 0.017499773696737546], ["kitchen", 0.016481151229279217], ["hours", 0.016029273350293107], ["simply", 0.016029273350293107], ["making", 0.016029273350293107], ["children", 0.015608585109519013], ["sugar", 0.014167190121322488], ["white", 0.013854426131154497], ["katmandu", 0.013273266498201293], ["times", 0.012493794720701999], ["waltz", 0.011588794689493013], ["knew", 0.011588794689493013], ["thing", 0.011182139966940135], ["room", 0.009940682922786234], ["night", 0.009627918932618244], ["long", 0.00933041793158512], ["mother", 0.008966569096464296], ["day", 0.008775711966916056], ["father", 0.007960215149049618], ["good", 0.0079119893018976], ["going", 0.006858069711413387]], "sentiment": ["So I was reading Writer\u2019s Digest one night, and I came across an announcement of the Caldwell Foundation\u2019s contest for playwrights.

I was writing a new draft of Katmandu.\nAnd I won first prize.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSauerbraten \u00e0 la Rudolph Waltz, R.Ph.: Mix in a saucepan a cup of wine vinegar, half a cup of white wine, half a cup of cider vinegar, two sliced onions, two sliced carrots, a rib of celery, chopped, two bay leaves, six whole allspice, crushed, two cloves, two tablespoons of crushed peppercorns, and a tablespoon of salt. Bring just to a boil.\nPour it hot over a four-pound rump roast, rolled and tied, in a deep bowl. Turn the meat around and around in the mixture. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for three days. Turn the meat in the mixture several times a day.\nTake the meat out of the marinade and dry it. Sear it on all sides in eight tablespoons of beef drippings in a braising pan. When it is nicely browned, take it out of the pan and pour out the drippings. Put the meat back in the pan, heat up the marinade, and pour it over the meat. Simmer for about three hours. Pour off the liquid, strain, and remove the excess fat. Keep the meat hot in the braising pan.\nMelt three tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and blend in three tablespoons of flour and a tablespoon of sugar. Gradually pour in the marinade, and stir until you have a uniform sauce. Add one cup of crushed ginger-snaps, and simmer the sauce for about six minutes.\nThat\u2019s it!\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFor three days I did not tell Mother and Father that I had won the contest. It takes that long to make sauerbraten. The sauerbraten was a complete surprise, since Mother and Father never went into the kitchen.

He had no idea what year it was or what planet he was on. Whatever the planet\u2019s name was, it was cold. But it wasn\u2019t the cold that had awakened Billy. It was animal magnetism which was making him shiver and itch. It gave him profound aches in his musculature, as though he had been exercising hard.\nThe animal magnetism was coming from behind him. If Billy had had to guess as to the source, he would have said that there was a vampire bat hanging upside down on the wall behind him.\nBilly moved down toward the foot of his cot before turning to look at whatever it was. He didn\u2019t want the animal to drop into his face and maybe claw his eyes out or bite off his big nose. Then he turned. The source of the magnetism really did resemble a bat. It was Billy\u2019s impresario\u2019s coat with the fur collar. It was hanging from a nail.\nBilly now backed toward it again, looking at it over his shoulder, feeling the magnetism increase. Then he faced it, kneeling on his cot, dared to touch it here and there. He was seeking the exact source of the radiations.\nHe found two small sources, two lumps an inch apart and hidden in the lining. One was shaped like a pea. The other was shaped like a tiny horseshoe. Billy received a message carried by the radiations. He was told not to find out what the lumps were. He was advised to be content with knowing that they could work miracles for him, provided he did not insist on learning their nature. That was all right with Billy Pilgrim. He was grateful. He was glad.\nBilly dozed, awakened in the prison hospital again. The sun was high. Outside were Golgotha sounds of strong men digging holes for upright timbers in hard, hard ground. Englishmen were building themselves a new latrine. They had abandoned their old latrine to the Americans\u2014and their theater, the place where the feast had been held, too.\nSix Englishmen staggered through a hospital with a pool table on which several mattresses were piled. They were transferring it to living quarters attached to the hospital. They were followed by an Englishman dragging his mattress and carrying a dartboard.\nThe man with the dartboard was the Blue Fairy Godmother who had injured little Paul Lazzaro. He stopped by Lazzaro\u2019s bed, asked Lazzaro how he was.\nLazzaro told him he was going to have him killed after the war.\n\u201cOh?\u201d", -0.06542715514937739], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["boaz", 0.10945292768103099], ["clubs", 0.09213771911011721], ["marvel", 0.08077465057634763], ["night", 0.07745260090805468], ["fine", 0.07710231678514302], ["hollywood", 0.07513405348169541], ["pair", 0.07412768159096789], ["wasn", 0.07064475288253848], ["knowledge", 0.06941158204257804], ["couldn", 0.06334127281951787], ["round", 0.06023755273216126], ["lucky", 0.05282796053965212], ["buddy", 0.05140154452342868], ["unk", 0.04944001715783068], ["happy", 0.046685444975038834], ["maximum", 0.04606885955505861], ["embroidered", 0.04606885955505861], ["circulate", 0.04606885955505861], ["seized", 0.04606885955505861], ["uncomprehending", 0.04606885955505861], ["aspirations", 0.04606885955505861], ["knowed", 0.04606885955505861], ["whoop", 0.04606885955505861], ["conviction", 0.04606885955505861], ["formlessness", 0.04606885955505861], ["superstitious", 0.04606885955505861], ["stressed", 0.04606885955505861], ["everwhere", 0.04606885955505861], ["soldier", 0.043868227648372296], ["earth", 0.041432525869756015], ["withered", 0.04038732528817381], ["happiness", 0.04038732528817381], ["concern", 0.04038732528817381], ["generally", 0.04038732528817381], ["birdlike", 0.04038732528817381], ["rotten", 0.04038732528817381], ["expressing", 0.04038732528817381], ["dee", 0.04038732528817381], ["doo", 0.04038732528817381], ["achieve", 0.04038732528817381], ["everthing", 0.04038732528817381], ["conceal", 0.04038732528817381], ["hisself", 0.04038732528817381], ["buddies", 0.04038732528817381], ["conquest", 0.03706384079548394], ["pathetic", 0.03706384079548394], ["magical", 0.03706384079548394], ["cooed", 0.03470579102128902], ["man", 0.033948635640871416], ["luck", 0.03294234349299879], ["rocked", 0.03287674551871353], ["describe", 0.03287674551871353], ["club", 0.03287674551871353], ["famous", 0.03287674551871353], ["going", 0.031713135871249645], ["hoped", 0.03138230652859914], ["chuckled", 0.03138230652859914], ["arm", 0.03011877636608063], ["lead", 0.03011877636608063], ["earthlings", 0.029024256754404218], ["good", 0.028673448429433826], ["birds", 0.02805882203590927], ["smile", 0.02805882203590927], ["places", 0.02805882203590927], ["deep", 0.02641398026982606], ["carry", 0.02641398026982606], ["questions", 0.02570077226171434], ["supposed", 0.022377287769024472], ["person", 0.020732446002941267], ["boy", 0.018190192492254054], ["day", 0.016695753502139674], ["order", 0.016471171746499393], ["place", 0.0160396657343238], ["life", 0.013840780598301839], ["things", 0.012929095064611474], ["long", 0.012929095064611474], ["people", 0.0127865397964814], ["three", 0.01025371322336171]], "sentiment": ["And he was too good a soldier to go around asking questions, trying to round out his knowledge.\nA soldier\u2019s knowledge wasn\u2019t supposed to be round.\nSo that Boaz didn\u2019t really know anything about Unk except that he had been very lucky once.

portable radios and tape-players some young people carried with them wherever they went in cities in the United States, playing music at a volume capable of drowning out a thunderstorm. These were called \u201cghetto blasters.\u201d It wasn\u2019t enough, a million years ago, that we already had ghetto blasters inside our heads!\nEven at this late date, I am still full of rage at a natural order which would have permitted the evolution of something as distracting and irrelevant and disruptive as those great big brains of a million years ago. If they had told the truth, then I could see some point in everybody\u2019s having one. But these things lied all the time! Look at how *James Wait was lying to Mary Hepburn!\nAnd now *Siegfried von Kleist returned to the cocktail lounge, having witnessed the shooting of Zenji Hiroguchi and Andrew MacIntosh. If his big brain had been a truth machine, he might have given Mary and *Wait information to which they were surely entitled, and which might have been very useful to them, in case they wished to survive: that he was in the first stages of a mental crack-up, that two hotel guests had just been shot, that the crowd outside couldn\u2019t be held back much longer, that the hotel was out of touch with the rest of the world, and so on.\nBut no. He maintained a placid exterior. He did not wish his remaining four guests to panic. As a result, they would never find out what became of Zenji Hiroguchi and Andrew MacIntosh. For that matter, they would never hear the news, which would be announced in about an hour, that Peru had declared war on Ecuador, and neither would the Captain. When Peruvian rockets hit targets in the Guayaquil area, they would believe the Captain when he said what his big brain honestly believed to be the truth, not that it felt any compunction to tell the truth: that they were being showered by meteorites.\nAnd, as long as there was anybody on Santa Rosalia curious as to why his or her ancestors had come there\u2014and that sort of curiosity would finally peter out only after about three thousand years\u2014that was the story: They were driven off the mainland by a shower of meteorites.\nQuoth Mandarax:\nHappy is the nation without a history.\n\u2014CESARE BONESANA, MARCHESE DI BECCARIA\n(1738\u20141794)\nSo, in a perfectly calm tone of voice, *Siegfried, the Captain\u2019s brother, asked *Wait to go upstairs, and to ask Selena MacIntosh and Hisako Hiroguchi to come down, and to help them with their luggage. \u201cBe careful not to alarm them,\u201d he said. \u201cLet them know that everything is perfectly all right.

There was probably this factor, too: she wanted to make it clear to me, to Fred, to Gregory, to the hermaphrodite cook, to everybody, that she had not caused me to be brought all the way from the West Coast for purposes of hanky-panky.\nAnd if only I could get back there in a time machine, what incredible fortune I could tell for her:\n\u201cYou will be as beautiful as you are now, but much, much wiser, when you and I are reunited in Florence, Italy, after World War Two. What a war you will have had!\n\u201cYou and Fred and Gregory will have moved to Italy, and Fred and Gregory will have been killed in the Battle of Sidi Barrani\u2014in Egypt. You will have then won the heart of Mussolini\u2019s minister of culture, Bruno, the Oxford-educated Count Portomaggiore, one of Italy\u2019s largest landowners. He will also have been head of the British spy apparatus in Italy all through the war.\u201d\nWhen I visited her in her palace after the war, incidentally, she showed me a painting given to her by the mayor of Florence. It depicted the death of her late husband before a Fascist firing squad near the end of the war.\nThe painting was the sort of commercial kitsch Dan Gregory used to do, and of which I myself was and remain capable.\nHer sense of her place in the world back in 1933, with the Great Depression going on, revealed itself, I think, in a conversation we had about A Doll\u2019s House, the play by Henrik Ibsen. A new reader\u2019s edition of that play had just come out, with illustrations by Dan Gregory, so we both read it and then discussed it afterwards.\nGregory\u2019s most compelling illustration showed the very end of the play, with the leading character, Nora, going out the front door of her comfortable house, leaving her middle-class husband and children and servants behind, declaring that she had to discover her own identity out in the real world before she could be a strong mother and wife.\nThat is how the play ends. Nora isn\u2019t going to allow herself to be patronized for being as uninformed and helpless as a child anymore.\nAnd Marilee said to me, \u201cThat\u2019s where the play begins as far as I\u2019m concerned. We never find out how she survived. What kind of job could a woman get back then? Nora didn\u2019t have any skills or education.

eight years ago, which mercifully has been lost, so I do not have to paste it in here somewhere. I said, I remember, that Thomas Jefferson in his mansion called Monticello, with an artificial trout pool in its front yard, and its dumbwaiters for bringing wine and cider up from the basement, and its secret staircases and so on, was the Hugh Hefner of his time. Jefferson didn\u2019t have for servants young women with great balls of cotton stuck to their behinds. He owned honest-to-God slaves instead.\nA history professor explained to me afterward that Jefferson was so slow to free his slaves because he did not really own them. He had mortgaged them. Like this mortgaged house in which I write now, they belonged to the bank.\nAuthor\u2019s note: No entirely white descendent of Thomas Jefferson is alive today.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut the best part of that visit was finding out what had happened to a childhood playmate of mine. He was two years my junior, and had lived right next door to me in Indianapolis. We were playmates during the 1930s. His father and mine had both built grandiose houses during the boom of the 1920s. But during the 1930s they were both going broke. His father owned a furniture store which was bankrupt, and my father could find no work as an architect, and my mother and father were becoming widely known as deadbeats who would run huge charge accounts and never pay. This playmate sent me a note while I was in Charlottesville, and by God if he hadn\u2019t become head of the astronomy department at the university. Sam Goldstein was his name.\nSo Sam and I had a good talk about the work he was doing, which was mainly with radio telescopes, and the work I was doing. We told about our children. Things were going well.\nWe refreshed our memories about neighborhood dogs we had known, dogs which had known us, too. We remembered two bulldogs named Boots and Beans, who were owned by a family named Wales. Boots and Beans used to catch cats and small dogs and pull them in two. I personally witnessed their doing that to a cat of ours.\nSam and I laughed when I told about my father\u2019s sending the message to Mr. Wales that he would shoot Boots and Beans if they ever came into our yard again. Mr. Wales sent back the message that he would shoot Father if Father shot Boots and Beans.\nPsychoanalysts are missing important clues about patients\u2019 childhoods if they do not ask about dogs the patients knew; As I have said elsewhere, dogs still seem as respectable and interesting as people to me.

mind.\u201d She wasn\u2019t tired, was so keyed up, in fact, that she expected to spend the night staring at the ceiling. But she didn\u2019t want to exchange another word with this woman, wanted to hide her humiliation and disappointment in the white oblivion of bed.\nMrs. Faulkner became the perfect hostess, respectful and solicitous. The small guest room, tasteful, crisp, barren, like all guest rooms implied an invitation to make oneself at home, and at the same time admitted that it was an impossibility. The room was cool, as though the radiators had only been turned on an hour or so before, and the air was sweet with the smell of furniture polish.\n\u201cAnd this is for the baby and me?\u201d said Ruth. She had no intention of staying beyond the next morning, but felt forced to make conversation as Mrs. Faulkner lingered in the doorway.\n\u201cThis is for you alone, dear. I thought the baby would be more comfortable in my room. It\u2019s larger, you know. I hardly know where you\u2019d put a crib in here.\u201d She smiled primly. \u201cNow, you will forgive me, won\u2019t you, dear?\u201d She turned without waiting for an answer, and went to her room, humming softly.\nRuth lay wide-eyed for an hour between the stiff sheets. Her thoughts came in disconnected pulses of brilliance\u2014glimpses of this moment and that. Ted\u2019s long, contemplative face appeared again and again. She saw him as a lonely child\u2014as he had first come to her; then as a lover; then as a man. The shrine\u2014commemorating a child, ignoring a man\u2014made a pathetic kind of sense. For Mrs. Faulkner, Ted had died when he\u2019d loved another woman.\nRuth threw back the covers, and walked to the window, needing the refreshment of a look at the outdoors. There was only a brick wall a few feet away, chinked with snow. She tiptoed down the hall, toward the big living room windows that framed the blue Adirondack foothills. She stopped.\nMrs. Faulkner, her gross figure silhouetted through a thin nightgown, stood before the shelf of souvenirs, talking to it. \u201cGood night, darling, wherever you are. I hope you can hear me and know that your mother loves you.\u201d She paused, and appeared to be listening, and looked wise. \u201cAnd your child will be in good hands, darling\u2014the same hands that cradled you.\u201d She held up her hands for the shelf to see. \u201cGood night, Ted. Sleep tight.\u201d\nRuth stole back to bed. A few moments later, bare feet padded down the hall, a door closed, and all was still.\n* * *\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Hurley.\u201d Ruth blinked up at Ted\u2019s mother. The brick wall outside the guest room window glared, the snow gone. The sun was high. \u201cDid you sleep well, my child?\u201d The voice was cheerful, intimate. \u201cIt\u2019s almost noon.

Phoenician sailor who had beached his boat on sand in Normandy, and who was now offering a man painted blue two bronze spearheads for the fur hat he wore. He was thinking: \u201cWho is this crazy man?\u201d And I was thinking: \u201cWho is this crazy man?\u201d\nI had a whimsical idea: I thought of calling the secretary of the treasury, Kermit Winkler, a man who had graduated from Harvard two years after me, and saying this to him: \u201cI just tried out two of your dimes on Times Square, and they Worked like a dream. It looks like another great day for the coinage!\u201d\nI encountered a baby-faced policeman. He was as uncertain about his role in the city as I was. He looked at me sheepishly, as though there were every chance that I was the policeman and he was the old bum. Who could be sure of anything that early in the day?\nI looked at my reflection in the black marble fa\u00e7ade of a shuttered record store. Little did I dream that I would soon be a mogul of the recording industry, with gold and platinum recordings of moronic cacophony on my office wall.\nThere was something odd about the position of my arms in my reflection. I pondered it. I appeared to be cradling a baby. And then I understood that this was harmonious with my mood, that I was actually carrying what little future I thought I had as though it were a baby. I showed the baby the tops of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building, the lions in front of the Public Library. I carried it into an entrance to Grand Central Station, where, if we tired of the city, we could buy a ticket to simply anywhere.\nLittle did I dream that I would soon be scuttling through the catacombs beneath the station, and that I would learn the secret purpose of The RAMJAC Corporation down there.\nThe baby and I headed back west again. If we had kept going east, we would have soon delivered ourselves to Tudor City, where my son lived. We did not want to see him. Yes, and we paused before the window of a store that offered wicker picnic hampers\u2014fitted out with Thermos bottles and tin boxes for sandwiches and so on. There was also a bicycle. I assumed that I could still ride a bicycle. I told the baby in my mind that we might buy a hamper and a bicycle and ride out on an abandoned dock some nice day and eat chicken sandwiches and wash them down with lemonade, while seagulls soared and keened overhead. I was beginning to feel hungry. Back in prison I would have been full of coffee and oatmeal by then.\nI passed the Century Association on West Forty-third Street, a gentleman\u2019s club where, shortly after the Second World War, I had once been the luncheon guest of Peter Gibney, the composer, a Harvard classmate of mine. I was never invited back. I would have given anything now to be a bartender in there, but Gibney was still alive and probably still a member. We had had a falling out, you might say, after I testified against Leland Clewes. Gibney sent me a picture postcard, so that my wife and the postman could read the message, too.\n\u201cDear shithead,\u201d it said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you crawl back under a damp rock somewhere?\u201d The picture was of the Mona Lisa, with that strange smile of hers.\nDown the block was the Coffee Shop of the Hotel Royalton, and I made for that. The Royalton, incidentally, like the Arapahoe, was a Hospitality Associates, Ltd., hotel; which is to say, a RAMJAC hotel. By the time I reached the coffee-shop door, however, my self-confidence had collapsed. Panic had taken its place. I believed that I was the ugliest, dirtiest little old bum in Manhattan. If I went into the coffee shop, everybody would be nauseated. They would throw me out and tell me to go to the Bowery, where I belonged.", -0.04230769230769232], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["kids", 0.2998923065458466], ["roasted", 0.2883007081017759], ["curtain", 0.2883007081017759], ["hazel", 0.13814553394152299], ["pinned", 0.10942998950623194], ["blandly", 0.10942998950623194], ["react", 0.10942998950623194], ["catnip", 0.10942998950623194], ["murdering", 0.10942998950623194], ["grownups", 0.09610023603392528], ["yeah", 0.09610023603392528], ["sympathizers", 0.09610023603392528], ["velvet", 0.09610023603392528], ["44", 0.09610023603392528], ["reacted", 0.09610023603392528], ["son", 0.09354857370394533], ["pull", 0.08277048256161866], ["hadn", 0.08277048256161866], ["crosby", 0.08211582280133256], ["note", 0.07847926042096076], ["murdered", 0.07847926042096076], ["recalled", 0.07847926042096076], ["communist", 0.07497307663646165], ["moved", 0.06944072908931201], ["alive", 0.06944072908931201], ["looked", 0.06917458293128591], ["sign", 0.06717567071130463], ["weren", 0.06717567071130463], ["iron", 0.06514950694865414], ["thing", 0.06473177958044575], ["chair", 0.058678887013630804], ["front", 0.058678887013630804], ["black", 0.05611097561700537], ["supposed", 0.05494511750515085], ["hook", 0.051819753476347485], ["person", 0.04913202381528675], ["children", 0.04534913354132416], ["asked", 0.02268269130398481], ["man", 0.021062300080566736]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYeah.

that it was a timetable of some sort, maybe for the bus from Scipio to Rochester, a not very subtle hint that I should get out of town as soon as possible. But then I realized that what was doing all the arriving and departing was me, and that the depot, so to speak, was the home of the College President.\nThe accuracy of the times and dates was attested to by Terrence W. Steel, Jr., whom I had known simply as Terry. I hadn\u2019t known his full name, and believed him to be what he was said to be, a new gardener working for Buildings and Grounds. He was in fact the private detective Wilder hired to get the goods on me. What little he had told me about himself may have been invented by GRIOT\u2122, or much of it could have been true. Who knows? Who cares?\nHe told me, I remember, that his wife had discovered she was a lesbian, and fell in love with a female junior high school dietitian. Then both women disappeared along with his 3 kids. GRIOT\u2122 could have cooked that up.\nTHE TIMETABLE ABOUT me and Zuzu was signed by the detective and notarized. I knew the Notary. Everybody did. He was Lyle Hooper, the Fire Chief and owner of the Black Cat Caf\u00e9. He, too, would be killed soon after the prison break. That document with his seal was all I needed to see in order to understand that my tenure was down the toilet.\nWilder said that the rest of the papers in the folder were affidavits gathered by his detective. They attested to my having been a shameless adulterer from the moment I and my family hit Scipio. \u201cI expect you to agree with me,\u201d he said, \u201cthat your behavior in this valley would fall dead center into even the narrowest definition of moral turpitude.\u201d\nI put the folder flat on the table to indicate that I had no need to look inside. My gesture was like folding a poker hand. In so doing, I would lay it on top of the school\u2019s annual Treasurer\u2019s Report, one copy of which had been put at every seat before the meeting. I would inadvertently take the report with me when I left, learning later from it something I hadn\u2019t known before. The college had sold all its property in the town below, including the ruins of the brewery and the wagon factory and the carpet mills and the land under the Black Cat Caf\u00e9, to the same Japanese corporation which owned the prison.\nAND THEN THE Treasurer had put the proceeds of the sale, less real estate commissions and lawyers\u2019 fees, into preferred stock in Microsecond Arbitrage.\n\u201cTHIS IS NOT a happy moment in my life,\u201d said Wilder.\n\u201cNor mine,\u201d I said.\n\u201cUnfortunately for all of us,\u201d he said, \u201cthe moving finger writes; and, having writ, moves on.\u201d", 0.03410599585599584], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["buzzer", 0.17485840317705723], ["talks", 0.1373439263059044], ["goin", 0.12653152342302001], ["fight", 0.10804759860808813], ["americans", 0.10037607667604065], ["blond", 0.10037607667604065], ["older", 0.09723519572520375], ["ain", 0.08956367379315626], ["english", 0.08956367379315626], ["bad", 0.083613179091444], ["eddie", 0.07875127091027188], ["frightened", 0.07791392556041814], ["desperation", 0.07791392556041814], ["bleary", 0.07791392556041814], ["speaks", 0.07791392556041814], ["collapsed", 0.07791392556041814], ["jerries", 0.07791392556041814], ["redoubled", 0.07791392556041814], ["surprisingly", 0.0686719631529522], ["challengingly", 0.0686719631529522], ["doin", 0.0686719631529522], ["dialect", 0.0686719631529522], ["wha", 0.0686719631529522], ["thrust", 0.0686719631529522], ["refugees", 0.0686719631529522], ["shout", 0.06326576171151001], ["lungs", 0.06326576171151001], ["stare", 0.05943000074548626], ["tangled", 0.05943000074548626], ["motor", 0.05645475339463013], ["till", 0.05645475339463013], ["wide", 0.054023799304044065], ["face", 0.05150723764275236], ["glanced", 0.04861759786260188], ["step", 0.047212790987164195], ["speak", 0.047212790987164195], ["spirits", 0.047212790987164195], ["huh", 0.047212790987164195], ["bright", 0.04594198858977319], ["filled", 0.04478183689657813], ["changed", 0.043714600794264306], ["low", 0.043714600794264306], ["sighed", 0.04272649449888136], ["class", 0.041806589545722], ["german", 0.04013774763966858], ["passed", 0.03865473917153226], ["moment", 0.03670002618230725], ["won", 0.03396943401369374], ["side", 0.03396943401369374], ["hands", 0.029768353391828473], ["pretty", 0.029768353391828473], ["find", 0.02906643694535618], ["will", 0.02906643694535618], ["mind", 0.02715842569681387], ["work", 0.026022988252276443], ["man", 0.025418541034922824], ["turned", 0.024727471606227805], ["eyes", 0.022885467093150244], ["boy", 0.020170814356600383], ["good", 0.015734737638923902]], "sentiment": ["The blond seemed frightened.

If a person stopped living up to expectations, because of bad chemicals or one thing or another, everybody went on imagining that the person was living up to expectations anyway.\nThat was the main reason the people in Midland City were so slow to detect insanity in their associates. Their imagination insisted that nobody changed much from day to day. Their imaginations were flywheels on the ramshackle machinery of the awful truth.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen Dwayne left Patty Keene and his Burger Chef, when he got into his demonstrator and drove away, Patty Keene was persuaded that she could make him happy with her young body, with her bravery and cheerfulness. She wanted to cry about the lines in his face, and the fact that his wife had eaten Dr\u0101no, and that his dog had to fight all the time because it couldn\u2019t wag its tail, about the fact that his son was a homosexual. She knew all those things about Dwayne. Everybody knew those things about Dwayne.\nShe gazed at the tower of radio station WMCY, which Dwayne Hoover owned. It was the tallest structure in Midland City. It was eight times as tall as the tombstone of George Hickman Bannister. It had a red light on top of it\u2014to keep airplanes away.\nShe thought about all the new and used cars Dwayne owned.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.07950028232636928], "title": "Breakfast of

a little crazy after having been locked up and hungry for so long. The hell of it is that I wasn\u2019t forced into doing what I did. I wasn\u2019t cornered. I did it because I wanted to.\nPeterswald wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d expected. I\u2019d hoped for at least a store or two where we could beg or steal a couple of cigarettes and something to eat. But the town wasn\u2019t anything more than two dozen farms, each with a wall and a ten-foot gate. They were jammed together on a green hilltop, overlooking the fields, so that they formed a solid fort. With tanks and artillery on their way, though, Peterswald was nothing but a pretty push-over, and it didn\u2019t look like anybody felt like making the Russians fight for it.\nHere and there a white flag\u2014a bedsheet on the end of a broomstick\u2014fluttered from a second-story window. Every gate stood open\u2014unconditional surrender.\n\u201cThis looks as good as any,\u201d said George. He gripped my arm, steered me out of the mob, through the gate, and into the hard-packed courtyard of the first farm we came to.\nThe yard was closed in on three sides by the house and farm buildings, with the wall and gate across the fourth. Looking through the open doors into the vacant barns, and through the windows into the still house, I felt for the first time like what I really was\u2014a worried stranger. Up to then, I\u2019d walked, talked, and acted as though I was a special case, an American, somehow out of this European mess, without a damn thing to be afraid of. Walking into a ghost town changed my mind\u2014\nOr maybe I was beginning to be afraid of George. Saying that now may be hindsight\u2014I don\u2019t know for sure. Maybe, down deep, I was starting to wonder. His eyes were too big and interested whenever I said something, and he couldn\u2019t keep his hands off me, pawing, patting, slapping; and every time he talked about what he wanted to do next, it was \u201cYou and me, Sammy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHello!\u201d he shouted. He got a quick echo from the walls around us, and then silence. He still held my arm, and he gave it a squeeze. \u201cAin\u2019t this cozy, Sammy? Looks like we got the place all to ourselves.\u201d He pushed the big gate shut, and slid the thick wooden cross-bar across it. I don\u2019t think I could have budged the gate then, but George had moved it without even changing his expression. He walked back to my side, dusting his hands and grinning.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the angle, George?\u201d\n\u201cTo the victor go the spoils\u2014ain\u2019t that right?\u201d He kicked open the front door. \u201cWell, go on in, kid. Help yourself. Georgie\u2019s just fixed things so nobody\u2019s going to bother us till we\u2019ve got the pick of the stuff. Go find something real nice for your mother and your girlfriend, huh?\u201d\n\u201cAll I want is a smoke,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can open the damn gate as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d", 0.005055014430014425], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
