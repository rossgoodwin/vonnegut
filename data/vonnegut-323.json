One of the things Capote said to me which rings absolutely true is that Salinger wanted to be published by The New Yorker or nobody. I am not a member of that unique family, nor is Mailer, nor Arthur Miller, and on and on. And yet members of that family will talk to the likes of us about who will succeed Shawn, who should succeed him, and so on, as though we gave a good god damn. My point is that membership in that family might skew a writer\u2019s career more significantly than his or her choice of a spouse or two. Or than his or her being a Catholic or a Jew or a homosexual or whatever. As an anthropologist much interested in the rewards and punishments applied in small groups, I feel that this is well worth looking into.\nCheers\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut\nDecember 28, 1986\nNew York City\nTO HELEN AND WALTER A.
