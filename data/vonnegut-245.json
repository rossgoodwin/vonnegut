["Lazarro hunched over, rubbed his eyes. It was absolutely true that he drew like a child. He drew like an astonishing, wildly imaginative child\u2014but like a child all the same. Some of the things he did now, in fact, were almost indistinguishable from things he had done in childhood.\nLazarro found himself wondering if perhaps his greatest work hadn\u2019t been his very first. His first work of any importance had been in stolen colored chalk on a sidewalk in the shadows of a Chicago El. He had been twelve.\nHe had begun his first big work as a piece of slum-craftiness, part racket, part practical joke. Bigger and bigger the bright chalk picture had grown\u2014and crazier and crazier. Green sheets of rain, laced with black lightning, fell on jumbled pyramids. It was daytime here and nighttime there, with a pale gray moon making daytime, with a hot red sun making night.\nAnd the bigger and crazier the picture had become, the more a growing crowd had loved it. Change had showered on the sidewalk. Strangers had brought the artist more chalk. Police had come. Reporters had come. Photographers had come. The mayor himself had come.\nWhen young Lazarro had arisen at last from his hands and knees, he had made himself, for one summer day at least, the most famous and beloved artist in the Middle West. Now he wasn\u2019t a boy anymore. He was a man who made his living painting like a boy, and his wife was asking him to paint an Indian that really looked like an Indian.\n\u201cIt will be so easy for you,\u201d said Sylvia. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to put soul in it or anything.\u201d She scowled and shaded her eyes, pretended to scan the horizon like a Stedman Indian. \u201cJust do um heap big Injun,\u201d she said.\nBy one in the morning, Durling Stedman had driven himself almost out of his wits. Pounds of paint had been laid on the canvas before him. Pounds had been scraped away. No matter how abstract Stedman made his beginnings, the hackneyed themes of a lifetime came through. He could not restrain a cube from turning into a cottage, a cone from turning into a snow-capped mountain, a sphere from becoming a harvest moon. And Indians popped up everywhere, numerous enough at times for a panorama of Custer\u2019s Last Stand.\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t keep your talent from busting right through, can you?\u201d his wife Cornelia said.\nStedman blew up, ordered her to bed.\n\u201cIt would be a hell of a help if you wouldn\u2019t watch,\u201d John Lazarro said to his wife peevishly.", 0.2112805662805663], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["doubleday", 0.23810390682952454], ["george", 0.11835816386716977], ["fountain", 0.11678931796346934], ["future", 0.1035039774320886], ["return", 0.06471142948073451], ["cc", 0.05839465898173467], ["undemanding", 0.05839465898173467], ["companies", 0.05839465898173467], ["electricians", 0.05839465898173467], ["convey", 0.05839465898173467], ["hydraulic", 0.05839465898173467], ["heartlessness", 0.05839465898173467], ["crippled", 0.05839465898173467], ["birdbath", 0.05839465898173467], ["bud", 0.05839465898173467], ["foolishly", 0.05172978224558135], ["carole", 0.05172978224558135], ["lucy", 0.05172978224558135], ["yard", 0.05172978224558135], ["cooperative", 0.04783107928300284], ["principal", 0.04783107928300284], ["ross", 0.04783107928300284], ["generously", 0.04783107928300284], ["sensitive", 0.04783107928300284], ["swallowed", 0.04783107928300284], ["hugeness", 0.04783107928300284], ["associate", 0.04506490550942802], ["facing", 0.04506490550942802], ["thanked", 0.04506490550942802], ["behaved", 0.04506490550942802], ["arrive", 0.04506490550942802], ["engineers", 0.04506490550942802], ["productive", 0.04506490550942802], ["architects", 0.04506490550942802], ["contact", 0.04506490550942802], ["sam", 0.044458546507823896], ["charge", 0.04291929443909909], ["selected", 0.04291929443909909], ["built", 0.04291929443909909], ["cancel", 0.041166202546849516], ["promises", 0.041166202546849516], ["hated", 0.03968398447158742], ["nature", 0.03968398447158742], ["owe", 0.03968398447158742], ["trade", 0.038400028773274704], ["agree", 0.038400028773274704], ["sit", 0.038400028773274704], ["spend", 0.038400028773274704], ["project", 0.03625441770294576], ["promised", 0.03625441770294576], ["buddy", 0.03533797366636572], ["explain", 0.03533797366636572], ["broken", 0.03533797366636572], ["exactly", 0.033731684390758354], ["starting", 0.033731684390758354], ["remains", 0.032355714740367254], ["leave", 0.031735152037121385], ["offered", 0.030602622848117697], ["plenty", 0.030602622848117697], ["longer", 0.030602622848117697], ["easily", 0.03008274572051889], ["farber", 0.029120404772855598], ["sell", 0.028673096930212395], ["mind", 0.02824567613626207], ["personal", 0.02783644907454288], ["sold", 0.02706680765460503], ["life", 0.026748332826465097], ["friendly", 0.02670391988553919], ["small", 0.02635423099928078], ["rest", 0.025375551246300563], ["surely", 0.02507027530096806], ["understand", 0.024774393967633892], ["wanted", 0.02367429443707866], ["lawrence", 0.02341786898436557], ["talk", 0.021792135041635435], ["asked", 0.021580799400108753], ["jr", 0.02040193091845171], ["big", 0.019351937726480632], ["hope", 0.0188670256723759], ["thought", 0.018710674510147244], ["things", 0.01675299224821225], ["books", 0.015343343457905754], ["writing", 0.014607381177883308], ["lot", 0.013737054182298387], ["will", 0.012891676004387027], ["people", 0.011228555342903611], ["time", 0.007545937532748745], ["vonnegut", 0.004926566375816127], ["kurt", 0.0024038330636287136]], "sentiment": ["My future is what remains of my life, though.
