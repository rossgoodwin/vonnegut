People were going to have to tell it what to do next, if it wasn\u2019t going to be an utterly amoral plaything of Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion.\nTrout, on his cot next door to the Academy, was operating nothing more dangerous or headstrong than a ballpoint pen. When free will kicked in, he simply went on writing. He finished the story. The wings of a narrative, begging to be told, had carried its author over what was for most of us a yawning abyss.\nOnly after he had completed his own absorbing business, the story, was Trout at liberty to notice what the outside world, or, indeed, the Universe, might be doing now, if anything. And as a man without a culture or a society, he was uniquely free to apply Occam\u2019s Razor, or, if you like, the Law of Parsimony, to virtually any situation, to wit: The simplest explanation of a phenomenon is, nine times out of ten, say, truer than a really fancy one.\nTrout\u2019s ruminations about how he had been able to finish a story whose completion had been so long opposed were uncomplicated by conventional paradigms of what life was all about, and what the Universe can or cannot do, and so on. Thus was the old science fiction writer able to go directly to this simple truth: That everybody had been going through what he had been going through for the past ten years, that he hadn\u2019t gone nuts or died and gone to hell, and that the Universe had shrunk a little bit, but had then resumed expansion, making everybody and everything a robot of their own past, and demonstrating, incidentally, that the past was unmalleable and indestructible, to wit:\nThe Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\nMoves on: nor all your Piety nor a Line,\nShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\nNor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.\nAnd then, on what was the afternoon of February 13th, 2001, in New York City, way-the-hell-and-gone up on West 155th Street, and everywhere, free will had all of a sudden kicked in again.\n29", 0.09255256648113792], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["newt", 0.450797282070841], ["passion", 0.17017924596178527], ["consternation", 0.17017924596178527], ["clever", 0.15990488623136453], ["closely", 0.15990488623136453], ["abandoned", 0.15990488623136453], ["wild", 0.15193547368442847], ["love", 0.14382025527771702], ["hide", 0.1399186080908137], ["hiding", 0.13094309279506705], ["realized", 0.13094309279506705], ["expect", 0.12377628224284737], ["kissed", 0.12377628224284737], ["catharine", 0.12066873306464632], ["happen", 0.11781006493344859], ["telling", 0.11269932051771026], ["true", 0.10425686415827344], ["women", 0.0930548084848791], ["hell", 0.08454012907612918], ["woman", 0.07592719847552602], ["face", 0.07115822016750736], ["couldn", 0.06439957732327421], ["looked", 0.04354429558774016], ["going", 0.04121789193877724]], "sentiment": ["\"You would have seen it,\" she said. \"Women aren\u2019t very clever at hiding it.\"\nNewt looked closely at Catharine\u2019s face now.

I looked down on her wonderingly. Her skin was soft and clear. She was amazingly well-preserved for a woman of forty-five.\nWhat made her state of preservation even more remarkable was the story she now told of how she had spent the past fifteen years.\nShe was captured and raped in the Crimea, she said. She was shipped to the Ukraine by boxcar, was put to work in a labor gang.\n\u201cWe were stumbling sluts,\u201d she said, \u201cmarried to mud. When the war was over, nobody bothered to tell us. Our tragedy was permanent. No records were kept of us anywhere. We shuffled through ruined villages aimlessly. Anyone who had a menial, pointless job to do had only to wave us down and we would do it.\u201d\nShe separated herself from me in order to tell her yarn with larger gestures. I wandered over to my front window to listen\u2014listen while looking through dusty panes into the twigs of a birdless, leafless tree.\nDrawn crudely in the dust of three window-panes were a swastika, a hammer and sickle, and the Stars and Stripes. I had drawn the three symbols weeks before, at the conclusion of an argument about patriotism with Kraft. I had given a hearty cheer for each symbol, demonstrating to Kraft the meaning of patriotism to, respectively, a Nazi, a Communist, and an American.\n\u201cHooray, hooray, hooray,\u201d I\u2019d said.\nOn and on Helga spun her yarn, weaving a biography on the crazy loom of modern history. She escaped from the labor gang after two years, she said, was caught a day later by Asiatic half-wits with submachine guns and police dogs.\nShe spent three years in the prison, she said, and then she was sent to Siberia as an interpreter and file clerk in a huge prisoner-of-war camp. Eight thousand S.S. men were still held captive there, though the war had been over for years.\n\u201cI was there for eight years,\u201d she said, \u201cmercifully hypnotized by simple routines. We kept beautiful records of all those prisoners, of all those meaningless lives behind barbed-wire. Those S.S. men, once so young and lean and vicious, were growing gray and soft and self-pitying\u2014\u201d she said, \u201chusbands without wives, fathers without children, shopkeepers without shops,

kind of cockamamie police department outside Nazi Germany would have duties for a Diesel-dyke that monumental?\u201d\nHe thought he had ditched her by going in the front door of an art gallery, out the back, and into a parking lot that the gallery shared with the Nellie Prior Academy on the hill behind. But ten minutes after he got to the library, in she barged. She didn\u2019t get anything to read, but sat down at a table twenty feet away from him, and stared everywhere but at him, and drummed nervously on the tabletop with her fingertips until somebody told her to stop it.\nHere\u2019s what that was all about: This person was Martha Jones, a deinstitutionalized lunatic sixty years old, turned loose with pills in Ithaca, New York, where she had relatives she could stay with. She had seen Berman perform there the week before, onstage at Ithaca College. She followed him to Northampton because she believed that the greatest prophets had preached goodness as stand-up comedians, only pretending to be unserious. She was convinced that after Jesus was through preaching \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,\u201d and \u201cBlessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted,\u201d and \u201cBlessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth,\u201d and \u201cBlessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled,\u201d and so on, he winked and said, \u201cOnly kidding, folks.\u201d\nAnd now she thought Gil Berman was a reincarnation of that joking Christ.\nAnd there she was, front row center at the Calvin Theater, looking up at him with goo-goo eyes. He spoke directly to her. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve to look this good,\u201d he said. This was compassionate. He was thinking how awful it must be to have to go through life so unattractive. She was a gerontomorph, with grossly exaggerated facial features usually taken to connote maturity. In a word: Martha Jones was a female Neanderthal.\nBut Gil Berman\u2019s apology for his own paedomorphic good looks would in any case have been the segue into his next bit, which was about automobiles, to wit: \u201cI read in the paper the other day,\u201d he said, \u201cabout the death of what was believed to have been the oldest living thing in New England. It was a mulberry tree on Cape Cod, in Barnstable. It wasn\u2019t a New World native like those to whom Jeffrey Amherst made the gift of smallpox. No. Its mama and papa trees had to have been in merry England, home of capital punishment for property crimes and the Magna Carta. When they counted the rings in its trunk, there were 283 of the motherfuckers! Just think: If that tree had had wonderful ears and a brain like lucky us, it might have heard people talking about everything from the French and Indian War, in which Lord Amherst so distinguished himself, to the War on Drugs, in which no one and everyone is a winner.\u201d He paused, pretending to ransack his own brain for something else to say.\nAnd then he said, \u201cThat tree, when a sapling, must have crossed the Atlantic on a sailing ship. Imagine crossing the North Atlantic, whether on an errand for good or for evil, with only the restless winds of the planet to get you where you next wanted to do your thing. How\u2019s that for science fiction? And now we have automobiles, powered by the most addictive and destructive drug yet discovered, which is gasoline. Yes, and in one eensy-weensy century we have sucked the last drop of petroleum from our planet\u2019s sweet flowing breast. For what? For an orgy of transportation whoopee, friends and neighbors. For shame! You think around-the-clock fucking and sucking is bad? Listen: The farts of our internal combustion engines have wrecked the atmosphere as a protective shield, and as anything a mother would want her child to breathe. You think people farts are bad? The polar ice caps are melting, I shit you not. The last polar bear, the last King of the Arctic, died ten days ago, and a mulberry stump on Cape Cod will soon be under three feet of saltwater.\n\u201cAnd I ask you again, friends and neighbors: \u2018How\u2019s that for science fiction?\u2019\n\u201cThere\u2019s bad news and there\u2019s good news,\u201d he said. \u201cMartians have landed in New York City. The good news is they only eat homeless people, and they pee gasoline. Only kidding, folks. Actually, a team of anthropologists from Mars has been studying the American way of life for the past ten years. They went back home last week on account of global warming. They didn\u2019t want to be roasted or drowned. But their leader said before lift-off that there were two things about Americans no Martian could ever understand. \u2018What is it,\u2019 he said, \u2018about blowjobs and golf?\u2019\u201d\nHe cleared his throat and pretended to make sure his voice was still working. He did this by singing scales as he used to do in singing class at Knightsbridge High: \u201cDo, re, mi, mi, mi,\u201d and so on. Again: What a voice!

"sentiment": ["The giraffes accepted Billy as one of their own, as a harmless creature as preposterously specialized as themselves. Two approached him from opposite sides, leaned against him. They had long, muscular upper lips which they could shape like the bells of bugles. They kissed him with these. They were female giraffes\u2014cream and lemon yellow. They had horns like doorknobs. The knobs were covered with velvet.\nWhy?\nNight came to the garden of the giraffes, and Billy Pilgrim slept without dreaming for a while, and then he traveled in time. He woke up with his head under a blanket in a ward for nonviolent mental patients in a veterans\u2019 hospital near Lake Placid, New York. It was springtime in 1948, three years after the end of the war.\nBilly uncovered his head. The windows of the ward were open. Birds were twittering outside. \u201cPoo-tee-weet?\u201d one asked him. The sun was high. There were twenty-nine other patients assigned to the ward, but they were all outdoors now, enjoying the day. They were free to come and go as they pleased, to go home, even, if they like\u2014and so was Billy Pilgrim. They had come here voluntarily, alarmed by the outside world.\nBilly had committed himself in the middle of his final year at the Ilium School of Optometry. Nobody else suspected that he was going crazy. Everybody else thought he looked fine and was acting fine. Now he was in the hospital. The doctors agreed: He was going crazy.\nThey didn\u2019t think it had anything to do with the war. They were sure Billy was going to pieces because his father had thrown him into the deep end of the Y.M.C.A. swimming pool when he was a little boy, and had then taken him to the rim of the Grand Canyon.\nThe man assigned to the bed next to Billy\u2019s was a former infantry captain named Eliot Rosewater. Rosewater was sick and tired of being drunk all the time.\nIt was Rosewater who introduced Billy to science fiction, and in particular to the writings of Kilgore Trout. Rosewater had a tremendous collection of science-fiction paperbacks under his bed. He had brought them to the hospital in a steamer trunk. Those beloved, frumpish books gave off a smell that permeated the ward\u2014like flannel pajamas that hadn\u2019t been changed for a month, or like Irish stew.\nKilgore Trout became Billy\u2019s favorite living author, and science fiction became the only sort of tales he could read.\nRosewater was twice as smart as Billy, but he and Billy were dealing with similar crises in similar ways. They had both found life meaningless, partly because of what they had seen in war. Rosewater, for instance, had shot a fourteen-year-old fireman, mistaking him for a German soldier. So it goes. And Billy had seen the greatest massacre in European history, which was the fire-bombing of Dresden.

He was familiar with the type, and loved the type: they were simply two Saturday Evening Post characters at the end of the road.\nWhen they weren\u2019t asking questions about the different things to drink, they were indistinguishable from millions of other American barflies on the first day of the New Age of Space. They sat solidly on their barstools, staring straight ahead at the ranks of bottles. Their lips moved constantly\u2014experimenting dismayingly with irrelevant grins and grimaces and sneers.\nEvangelist Bobby Denton\u2019s image of Earth as God\u2019s space ship was an apt one\u2014particularly with reference to barflies. Helmholtz and Miss Wiley were behaving like pilot and co-pilot of an enormously pointless voyage through space that was expected to take forever. It was easy to believe that they had begun the voyage nattily, flushed with youth and technical training, and that the bottles before them were the instruments they had been watching for years and years and years.\nIt was easy to believe that each day had found the space boy and the space girl microscopically more slovenly than the day before, until now, when they were the shame of the Pan-Galactic Space Service.\nTwo buttons on Helmholtz\u2019s fly were open. There was shaving cream in his left ear. His socks did not match.\nMiss Wiley was a crazy-looking little old lady with a lantern jaw. She wore a frizzy black wig that looked as though it had been nailed to a farmer\u2019s barn door for years.\n\"I see where the President has ordered a whole brand-new Age of Space to begin, to see if that won\u2019t help the unemployment picture some,\" said the bartender.\n\"Uh, huh,\" said Helmholtz and Miss Wiley simultaneously.\nOnly an observant and suspicious person would have noticed a false note in the behavior of the two: Helmholtz and Miss Wiley were too interested in time.

He had in fact written a twenty-six-line poem called \u201cThe Last Kanka-bono,\u201d about the extinction of a little tribe in the Ecuadorian rain forest. At the start of the poem, there were eleven Kanka-bonos. At the end there was just one, and he wasn\u2019t feeling well. This was an exercise in fiction, however, since the poet, like most Ecuadorians, had never seen a Kanka-bono. He had heard that the tribe was down to only fourteen members, so that their final extinction by the encroachments of civilization seemed inevitable.\nLittle did he know that in a matter of less than a century the blood of every human being on earth would be predominantly Kanka-bono, with a little von Kleist and Hiroguchi thrown in.\nAnd this astonishing turn of events would be made to happen, in large part, by one of the only two absolute nobodies on the original passenger list for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d That was Mary Hepburn. The other nobody was her husband, who himself played a crucial role in shaping human destiny by booking, when facing his own extinction, that one cheap little cabin below the waterline.\n22\nAMBASSADOR DONOSO\u2019S twenty-six lines of mourning for \u201cThe Last Kanka-bono\u201d were premature, to say the least.

Portomaggiore died of natural causes in her sleep in the same week my beloved Edith passed away.\nSome week for old Rabo Karabekian!\nThe middle brownstone has been divided into five apartments, one on each floor, including the basement, as I learned by the mailboxes and doorbells in the foyer.\nBut don\u2019t mention foyers to me! More about that in a little bit! All things in good time.\nThat middle house used to contain the guest room where I was first incarcerated, and Gregory\u2019s grand dining room right below that, and his research library below that, and the storage room for his art materials in the basement. I was mostly curious, though, about the top floor, which used to be the part of Gregory\u2019s studio with the big, leaky skylight. I wanted to know whether there was still a skylight up there, and, if so, if anybody had ever found a way to stop its leaks, or whether there were still pots and pans making John Cage music underneath it when it rained or snowed.\nBut there was nobody to ask, so I never found out. So there is one storytelling fizzle for you, dear Reader. I never found out.\nAnd here is another one. The house to the west of that one is, judging from the mailboxes and bells, evidentally a triplex at the bottom, with a duplex on top of that. It was this third of Gregory\u2019s establishment which the live-in servants had inhabited, and where I, too, was given a small but cheerful bedroom. Fred Jones\u2019s bedroom, by the way, was right in back of Gregory\u2019s and Marilee\u2019s room in the Emirate of Salibaar.\nThis woman came out of the brownstone with the duplex and triplex. She was old and trembly, but her posture was good, and it was easy to see that she had been very beautiful at one time. I locked my gaze to hers, and a flash of recognition went off in my skull. I knew her, but she didn\u2019t know me. We had never met. I realized that I had seen her in motion pictures when she was much younger. A second later, I came up with her name. She was Barbira Mencken, the ex-wife of Paul Slazinger. He had lost touch with her years ago, had no idea where she lived. She hadn\u2019t done a movie or a play for a long, long time, but there she was. Greta Garbo and Katharine Hepburn also live in that same general neighborhood.\nI didn\u2019t speak to her. Should I have spoken to her? What would I have had to say to her? \u201cPaul is fine and sends his best\u201d? Or how about this one: \u201cTell me how your parents died\u201d?\nI had supper at the Century Club, to which I have belonged for many years.

I\u2019m glad now, though, that I was pressured into becoming a scientist by my father and my brother. I understand how scientific reasoning and playfulness work, even though I have no talent for joining in. I enjoy the company of scientists, am easily excited and entertained when they tell me what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve spent a lot more time with scientists than with literary people, my brother\u2019s friends, mostly. I enjoy plumbers and carpenters and automobile mechanics, too. I didn\u2019t get to know any literary people until the last ten years, starting with two years of teaching at Iowa. There at Iowa, I was suddenly friends with Nelson Algren and Jos\u00e9 Donoso and Vance Bourjaily and Donald Justice and George Starbuck and Marvin Bell, and so on. I was amazed. Now, judging from the review my latest book, Slapstick, has received, people would like to bounce me out of the literary establishment\u2014 send me back where I came from.\nINTERVIEWER: There were some bad reviews?\nVONNEGUT: Only in The New York Times, Time, Newsweek, The New York Review of Books, The Village Voice, and Rolling Stone. They loved me in Medicine Hat.\nINTERVIEWER: TO what do you attribute this rancor?\nVONNEGUT: Slapstick may be a very bad book. I am perfectly willing to believe that. Everybody else writes lousy books, so why shouldn\u2019t I? What was unusual about the reviews was that they wanted people to admit now that I had never been any good. The reviewer for the Sunday Times actually asked critics who had praised me in the past to now admit in public how wrong they\u2019d been. My publisher, Sam Lawrence, tried to comfort me by saying that authors were invariably attacked when they became fabulously well-to-do.\nINTERVIEWER: You needed comforting?\nVONNEGUT: I never felt worse in my Ufe.

He would have been there if he had had any advance notice that Greathouse was going to surrender on this particular day. But he was in Atlantic City, addressing a convention of the American Association of Parole Officers up there. So it was finally Clyde Carter, the spit and image of President Carter, who came out of the front door a few steps and motioned to them.\nClyde smiled. \u201cYou all come in,\u201d he said.\nSo in they went, with the chauffeur bringing up the rear, carrying two valises made of buttery leather and a matching case for toiletries. Clyde relieved him of the bags at the threshold, told him politely to return to the limousine.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be needed in there,\u201d said Clyde.\nSo the chauffeur got back into the limousine. His name was Cleveland Lawes, a garbling of the name of the man I had ruined, Leland Clewes. He had only a grammar-school education, but he read five books a week while waiting for people, mostly RAMJAC executives and customers and suppliers. Because he had been captured by the Chinese during the Korean War, and had actually gone to China for a while and worked as a deckhand on a coastwise steamer in the Yellow Sea, he was reasonably fluent in Chinese.\nCleveland Lawes was reading The Gulag Archipelago now, an account of the prison system in the Soviet Union by another former prisoner, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.\nSo there I was all alone on a bench in the middle of nowhere again. I entered a period of catatonia again\u2014staring straight ahead at nothing, and every so often clapping my old hands three times.\nIf it had not been for that clapping, Cleveland Lawes tells me now, he would never have become curious about me.\nBut I became his business by clapping my hands. He had to find out why I did it.\nDid I tell him the truth about the clapping? No. It was too complicated and silly. I told him that I had been daydreaming about the past, and that whenever I remembered an especially happy moment, I would lift my hands from my lap, and I would clap three times.", 0.0553030303030303], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["monuments", 0.2547922143727191], ["avram", 0.16986147624847941], ["salesman", 0.1491705156347497], ["breed", 0.12414576368237826], ["agreed", 0.093295823786941], ["carved", 0.08493073812423971], ["heaped", 0.08493073812423971], ["travel", 0.08493073812423971], ["wandered", 0.08493073812423971], ["generation", 0.08493073812423971], ["location", 0.08493073812423971], ["showroom", 0.08493073812423971], ["gaily", 0.08493073812423971], ["director", 0.08493073812423971], ["necklace", 0.08493073812423971], ["cedar", 0.08493073812423971], ["peevishness", 0.08493073812423971], ["joke", 0.08493073812423971], ["lamps", 0.08493073812423971], ["institutional", 0.07458525781737485], ["relation", 0.07458525781737485], ["lessons", 0.07458525781737485], ["fourth", 0.07458525781737485], ["establishment", 0.07458525781737485], ["mistletoe", 0.07458525781737485], ["sale", 0.07458525781737485], ["bokononist", 0.07147828621849944], ["blank", 0.06853353978590972], ["suggestions", 0.06853353978590972], ["throat", 0.06853353978590972], ["dancing", 0.06853353978590972], ["memory", 0.06853353978590972], ["boughs", 0.06853353978590972], ["sons", 0.06853353978590972], ["pedestal", 0.06423977751051001], ["marble", 0.06423977751051001], ["grandfather", 0.06090927674462626], ["peculiar", 0.06090927674462626], ["tombstone", 0.06090927674462626], ["tree", 0.05588730306371264], ["business", 0.053894297203645136], ["asa", 0.053894297203645136], ["angel", 0.05056379643776141], ["driver", 0.05056379643776141], ["hung", 0.05056379643776141], ["talked", 0.04784257917218], ["suggested", 0.04554182275684779], ["course", 0.04264397179504245], ["laboratory", 0.040983887688919696], ["christmas", 0.040218316130896554], ["stone", 0.03949010472538265], ["great", 0.03813231699096882], ["years", 0.037497098865315145], ["wasn", 0.029504289367458993], ["dr", 0.025956951279740792], ["god", 0.024850862143118074], ["bokonon", 0.021099900526985148], ["asked", 0.017604476832943434]], "sentiment": ["I wasn\u2019t a Bokononist then, so I agreed with some peevishness.

goodbye to the departing troops. \u201cDibo, Takaru, dibo.\u201d\n8\nPAUL BREAKFASTED ALONE, while Anita and Finnerty, in widely separated beds, slept late after a busy evening.\nHe had difficulty starting his Plymouth and finally realized that it was out of gas. There had been almost a half-tank the afternoon before. Finnerty, then, had gone for a long ride in it after they\u2019d left him alone on the bed and gone to the Country Club without him.\nPaul rummaged about the glove compartment for a siphon hose, and found it. He paused, sensing that something was missing. He stuck his hand into the glove compartment again and felt around inside. The old pistol was gone. He looked on the floor and searched behind the seat cushion without finding it. Perhaps some urchin had taken it while he\u2019d been in Homestead after the whisky. He\u2019d have to tell the police about it right away, and there\u2019d be all sorts of forms to fill out. He tried to think of a lie that would get him out of accusations of negligence and not get anybody else in trouble.\nHe dipped the siphon hose into the station wagon\u2019s tank, sucked and spat, and plunged the other end of the hose into the Plymouth\u2019s empty tank. As he waited for the slow transfer to take place, he stepped out of the garage and into a warm patch of sunlight.\nThe bathroom window above clattered open, and he looked up to see Finnerty staring at himself in the medicine-cabinet mirror. Finnerty didn\u2019t notice Paul. He had a bent cigarette in his mouth, and there it remained while he washed his face with a cursory and random dabbing motion. The ash on the cigarette grew longer and longer, and, incredibly, longer, until the coal was almost at his lips. He removed the cigarette from his mouth, and the long ash fell. Finnerty flipped the butt in the direction of the toilet, replaced it with another, and proceeded to shave. And the ash grew longer and longer. He leaned close to the mirror, and the ash broke against it. He pressed a pimple between his thumb and forefinger, seemingly without results. Still squinting in the mirror at the reddened spot, he groped for a towel with one hand, seized one without looking at it, and swept Anita\u2019s stockings from the towel rack and into the bathtub. Finnerty, his toilet complete, said something to his reflection, grimaced, and made his exit.\nPaul returned to the garage, coiled the siphon hose in the glove compartment, and drove off. The car was hesitating again\u2014catching and slowing, catching and slowing. At any rate, it took his mind momentarily from the inconvenient matter of the missing pistol. On the long grade past the golf course, the engine seemed to be hitting on no more than three cylinders, and a squad from the Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps, putting in a spruce windbreak to the north of the clubhouse, turned to watch the car\u2019s enervated struggle with gravity.\n\u201cHey! Headlamp\u2019s busted,\u201d called one of the men.\nPaul nodded and smiled his thanks. The car faltered, and came to a stop, just short of the summit. Paul set his emergency brake and got out. He lifted the hood and tested various connections. Tools being laid against the side of the car made a clattering noise, and a half-dozen Reeks and Wrecks stuck their heads under the hood with his.", -0.009366246498599448], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["captain", 0.2089576945951125], ["harve", 0.13091710219102795], ["swears", 0.1281940322832302], ["desk", 0.12156370095531682], ["cabdriver", 0.1099533170053369], ["corridor", 0.10408111828654192], ["banged", 0.09928318258143784], ["wrong", 0.08333224038221902], ["sergeant", 0.07517026858474955], ["checked", 0.07321737378056176], ["malicious", 0.07321737378056176], ["lightbulbs", 0.07321737378056176], ["cells", 0.07321737378056176], ["jerk", 0.0640970161416151], ["interrupted", 0.0640970161416151], ["hustled", 0.058761948929665575], ["duckboards", 0.058761948929665575], ["angrily", 0.05497665850266845], ["taxicab", 0.05497665850266845], ["staircase", 0.05497665850266845], ["wet", 0.05497665850266845], ["basement", 0.05497665850266845], ["downstairs", 0.05497665850266845], ["lock", 0.05204055914327096], ["naked", 0.05204055914327096], ["answered", 0.04964159129071892], ["driver", 0.04964159129071892], ["pity", 0.04964159129071892], ["rang", 0.04761329287193921], ["iron", 0.04761329287193921], ["talked", 0.045856300863721805], ["witnesses", 0.045856300863721805], ["speaking", 0.045856300863721805], ["telling", 0.045856300863721805], ["listen", 0.045856300863721805], ["standing", 0.04166612019110951], ["floor", 0.04166612019110951], ["telephone", 0.03849293523299256], ["man", 0.03747631146637239], ["story", 0.03673594322477516], ["sick", 0.03673594322477516], ["truth", 0.03673594322477516], ["hit", 0.03593825083245365], ["making", 0.03593825083245365], ["office", 0.03254576255216286], ["happened", 0.03140087601282563], ["light", 0.030863744505980166], ["find", 0.02761558558582851], ["heard", 0.026817893193507], ["wasn", 0.022840513300442088], ["luby", 0.022009211963316667], ["wife", 0.021482825981557468], ["eyes", 0.020019330782738726], ["looked", 0.01694545116192945]], "sentiment": ["The captain interrupted him angrily, banged on his desk. \u201cI heard enough of that from your wife!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to listen to any more of it from you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I\u2019m telling the truth?\u201d said Harve. \u201cYou think we haven\u2019t checked your story?\u201d said the captain.\n\u201cWhat about the man who was with her out there?\u201d said Harve. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell you what really happened.

["I didn\u2019t tell GRIOT\u2122 that I had landed a job I loved here. I told it only about my life up to the end of the Vietnam War. It knew all about the Vietnam War and the sorts of veterans it had produced. It made me a burned-out case, on the basis of my length of service over there, I think. It had me becoming a wife-beater and an alcoholic, and winding up all alone on Skid Row.\nIF I HAD access to GRIOT\u2122 now, I might ask it what might have happened to Marilyn Shaw if Sam Wakefield hadn\u2019t rescued her. But the escaped convicts smashed up the one in the Pavilion soon after I showed them how to work it.\nThey hated it, and I didn\u2019t blame them. I was immediately sorry that I had let them know of its existence. One by one they punched in their race and age and what their parents did, if they knew, and how long they\u2019d gone to school and what drugs they\u2019d taken and so on, and GRIOT\u2122 sent them straight to jail to serve long sentences.\nI HAVE NO idea how much GRIOT\u2122 back then may have known about Vietnam nurses. The manufacturers claimed then as now that no program in stores was more than 3 months old, and so every program was right up-to-date about what had really happened to this or that sort of person at the time you bought it. The programmers, supposedly, were constantly updating GRIOT\u2122 with the news of the day about plumbers, about podiatrists, about Vietnam boat people and Mexican wetbacks, about drug smugglers, about paraplegics, about everyone you could think of within the continental limits of the United States and Canada.\nThere is some question now, I\u2019ve heard, about whether GRIOT\u2122 is as deep and up-to-date as it used to be, since Parker Brothers, the company that makes it, has been taken over by Koreans. The new owners are moving the whole operation to Indonesia, where labor costs next to nothing. They say they will keep up with American news by satellite.\nOne wonders.\nI DON\u2019T NEED any help from GRIOT\u2122 to know that Marilyn Shaw had a much rougher war than I did. All the soldiers she had to deal with were wounded, and all of them expected of her what was more often than not impossible: that she make them whole again.\nI know that she was married, and that her husband back home divorced her and married somebody else while she was still over there, and that she didn\u2019t care. She and Sam Wakefield may have been lovers over there. I never asked.\nThat seems likely. After the war he went looking for her and found her taking a course in Computer Science at New York University. She didn\u2019t want to be a nurse anymore. He told her that maybe she should try being a teacher instead. She asked him if there was a chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous in Scipio, and he said there was.\nAfter he shot himself, Marilyn, Professor Shaw, fell off the wagon for about a week. She disappeared, and I was given the job of finding her. I discovered her downtown, drunk and asleep on a pool table in the back room of the Black Cat Caf\u00e9. She was drooling on the felt. One hand was on the cue ball, as though she meant to throw it at something when she regained consciousness.", 0.06643166357452072], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["plummer",

coming out of the ventilation, Mr. Helmholtz continued to smile and wave his baton for the survivors, and to brood inwardly over the defeat his band had sustained in June, when Johnstown High School had won with a secret weapon, a bass drum seven feet in diameter. The judges, who were not musicians but politicians, had had eyes and ears for nothing but this Eighth Wonder of the World, and since then Mr. Helmholtz had thought of little else. But the school budget was already lopsided with band expenses. When the school board had given him the last special appropriation he\u2019d begged so desperately\u2014money to wire the plumes of the bandsmen\u2019s hats with flashlight bulbs and batteries for night games\u2014the board had made him swear like a habitual drunkard that, so help him God, this was the last time.\nOnly two members of the C Band were playing now, a clarinetist and a snare drummer, both playing loudly, proudly, confidently, and all wrong. Mr. Helmholtz, coming out of his wistful dream of a bass drum bigger than the one that had beaten him, administered the coup de grace to the waltz by clattering his stick against his music stand. \u201cAll righty, all righty,\u201d he said cheerily, and he nodded his congratulations to the two who had persevered to the bitter end.\nWalter Plummer, the clarinetist, responded gravely, like a concert soloist receiving an ovation led by the director of a symphony orchestra. He was small, but with a thick chest developed in summers spent at the bottom of swimming pools, and he could hold a note longer than anyone in the A Band, much longer, but that was all he could do. He drew back his tired, reddened lips, showing the two large front teeth that gave him the look of a squirrel, adjusted his reed, limbered his fingers, and awaited the next challenge to his virtuosity.\nThis would be Plummer\u2019s third year in the C Band, Mr. Helmholtz thought, with a mixture of pity and fear. Nothing could shake Plummer\u2019s determination to earn the right to wear one of the sacred letters of the A Band, so far, terribly far away.\nMr. Helmholtz had tried to tell Plummer how misplaced his ambitions were, to recommend other fields for his great lungs and enthusiasm, where pitch would be unimportant. But Plummer was in love, not with music, but with the letter sweaters. Being as tone-deaf as boiled cabbage, he could detect nothing in his own playing about which to be discouraged.\n\u201cRemember,\u201d said Mr. Helmholtz to the C Band, \u201cFriday is challenge day, so be on your toes. The chairs you have now were assigned arbitrarily. On challenge day it\u2019ll be up to you to prove which chair you really deserve.\u201d He avoided the narrowed, confident eyes of Plummer, who had taken the first clarinetist\u2019s chair without consulting the seating plan posted on the bulletin board. Challenge day occurred every two weeks, and on that day any bandsman could challenge anyone ahead of him to a contest for his position, with Mr. Helmholtz as judge.\nPlummer\u2019s hand was raised, its fingers snapping.\n\u201cYes, Plummer?\u201d said Mr. Helmholtz. He had come to dread challenge day because of Plummer. He had come to think of it as Plummer\u2019s day. Plummer never challenged anybody in the C Band or even the B Band, but stormed the organization at the very top, challenging, as was unfortunately the privilege of all, only members of the A Band. The waste of the A Band\u2019s time was troubling enough, but infinitely more painful for Mr. Helmholtz were Plummer\u2019s looks of stunned disbelief when he heard Mr. Helmholtz\u2019s decision that he hadn\u2019t outplayed the men he\u2019d challenged.\n\u201cMr. Helmholtz,\u201d said Plummer, \u201cI\u2019d like to come to A Band session that day.\u201d\n\u201cAll right\u2014if you feel up to it.\u201d Plummer always felt up to it, and it would have been more of a surprise if Plummer had announced that he wouldn\u2019t be at the A Band session.", 0.06572172619047618], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["bridge", 0.18974487590434713], ["walt", 0.07989393270551132], ["fishing", 0.07989393270551132], ["philadelphia", 0.07989393270551132], ["crater", 0.07989393270551132], ["posted", 0.07989393270551132], ["grating", 0.07989393270551132], ["poet", 0.07989393270551132], ["veiled", 0.07989393270551132], ["12", 0.07989393270551132], ["whitman", 0.07989393270551132], ["smoke", 0.07989393270551132], ["closing", 0.07989393270551132], ["sign", 0.07772573810489505], ["opposed", 0.0693917026970273], ["duck", 0.0693917026970273], ["toy", 0.0693917026970273], ["rubber", 0.0693917026970273], ["sheltered", 0.0693917026970273], ["brotherhood", 0.0693917026970273], ["younger", 0.0693917026970273], ["sneered", 0.0693917026970273], ["steadily", 0.0693917026970273], ["bathtub", 0.0693917026970273], ["truck", 0.06900809954575018], ["rim", 0.06324829196811571], ["sewer", 0.06324829196811571], ["crossing", 0.06324829196811571], ["driver", 0.059914020986649025], ["pyramid", 0.058889472688543276], ["veteran", 0.058889472688543276], ["named", 0.055727647093290936], ["bomb", 0.055508509789843126], ["veterans", 0.055508509789843126], ["um", 0.055508509789843126], ["storm", 0.0527460619596317], ["garbage", 0.05041044559861263], ["mentioned", 0.04838724268005926], ["ideas", 0.04838724268005926], ["lying", 0.04838724268005926], ["longer", 0.04660265123072011], ["distance", 0.04660265123072011], ["day", 0.04376842915377733], ["foot", 0.04224383195114768], ["honor", 0.03886286905244753], ["side", 0.03696645779556865], ["woman", 0.03450404977287509], ["earth", 0.03238644458537268], ["head", 0.029405985581644593], ["things", 0.02559819121375207], ["trout", 0.024400050462238698], ["thought", 0.024385422915668187], ["planet", 0.02362768927059756], ["white", 0.01917676323229206], ["kilgore", 0.014477446136779338], ["man", 0.014276760882991148], ["dwayne", 0.00698204853320196]], "sentiment": ["12\nKILGORE TROUT was far away, but he was steadily closing the distance between himself and Dwayne.
