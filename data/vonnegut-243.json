Neither Constant nor Beatrice had been interested. Martian veterans never were.\nInevitably, the long voyage had drawn Constant closer to his mate and child\u2014closer than they had been on the gilded system of catwalks, ramps, ladders, pulpits, steps, and stages in Newport. But the only love in the family unit was still the love between young Chrono and Beatrice. Other than the love between mother and son there was only politeness, glum compassion, and suppressed indignation at having been forced to be a family at all.\n\"Oh, my\u2014\" said Constant, \"life is funny when you stop to think of it.\"\nYoung Chrono did not smile when his father said life was funny.\nYoung Chrono was the member of the family least in a position to think life was funny. Beatrice and Constant, after all, could laugh bitterly at the wild incidents they had survived. But young Chrono couldn\u2019t laugh with them, because he himself was a wild incident.\nSmall wonder that young Chrono\u2019s chief treasures were a good-luck piece and a switchblade knife.\nYoung Chrono now drew his switchblade knife, flicked open the blade nonchalantly. His eyes narrowed. He was preparing to kill, if killing should become necessary. He was looking in the direction of a gilded rowboat that had put out from the palace on the island.\nIt was being rowed by a tangerine-colored creature. The oarsman was, of course, Salo. He was bringing the boat in order to transport the family back to the palace. Salo was a bad oarsman, never having rowed before. He grasped the oars with his suction-cup feet.\nHe had one advantage over human oarsmen, in that he had an eye in the back of his head.\nYoung Chrono flashed light into Old Salo\u2019s eye, flashed it with his bright knife blade.", 0.07865853658536588], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["elder", 0.18967864847746868], ["flies", 0.09483932423873434], ["languishing", 0.09483932423873434], ["plays", 0.09483932423873434], ["encourage", 0.09483932423873434], ["literature", 0.09483932423873434], ["tails", 0.09483932423873434], ["petrescence", 0.09483932423873434], ["atrophy", 0.09483932423873434], ["consolations", 0.09483932423873434], ["deprived", 0.09483932423873434], ["biting", 0.09483932423873434], ["die", 0.08982090602566897], ["glances", 0.08328687122940191], ["nervous", 0.08328687122940191], ["histories", 0.08328687122940191], ["104", 0.08328687122940191], ["snarling", 0.08328687122940191], ["hostess", 0.08328687122940191], ["snapping", 0.08328687122940191], ["shaking", 0.08328687122940191], ["sulfathiazole", 0.07652911942759918], ["approach", 0.07652911942759918], ["dogs", 0.07652911942759918], ["introducing", 0.07652911942759918], ["pleasant", 0.07652911942759918], ["mad", 0.07652911942759918], ["poems", 0.07652911942759918], ["system", 0.0717344182200695], ["lorenzans", 0.06801535903149933], ["sudden", 0.06497666641826676], ["writing", 0.06497666641826676], ["heavenly", 0.06497666641826676], ["demanded", 0.06497666641826676], ["expect", 0.06018196521073707], ["dying", 0.058218914616464015], ["started", 0.058218914616464015], ["ways", 0.05646290602216691], ["side", 0.05487440302542816], ["castle", 0.05104921236547962], ["thinking", 0.05085503541181336], ["suggested", 0.05085503541181336], ["heart", 0.049705154220364166], ["help", 0.04862951220140465], ["sir", 0.04862951220140465], ["real", 0.047619101837797405], ["turned", 0.04258108730658185], ["books", 0.04258108730658185], ["people", 0.04159027326112479], ["love", 0.037077059192072236], ["angela", 0.029308897026662246], ["mona", 0.028667792346198977], ["god", 0.02775012939314852], ["newt", 0.02501174520496058], ["san", 0.02427088249544668], ["man", 0.018253993403157837]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI just can\u2019t help thinking what a real shaking up it would give people if, all of a sudden, there were no new books, new plays, new histories, new poems \u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd how proud would you be when people started dying like flies?\u201d I demanded.\n\u201cThey\u2019d die more like mad dogs, I think\u2014snarling and snapping at each other and biting their own tails.\u201d\nI turned to Castle the elder. \u201cSir, how does a man die when he\u2019s deprived of the consolations of literature?\u201d\n\u201cIn one of two ways,\u201d he said, \u201cpetrescence of the heart or atrophy of the nervous system.\u201d\n\u201cNeither one very pleasant, I expect,\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Castle the elder. \u201cFor the love of God, both of you, please keep writing!\u201d\n104\nSULFATHIAZOLE\nMY HEAVENLY MONA did not approach me and did not encourage me with languishing glances to come to her side.

attention away from Paul. \u201c \u2018Not with all his gold and armies,\u2019 \u201d Shepherd quoted from the play. \u201c \u2018Not with all his gold and armies could Charlemagne have gotten one single electric lamp or vacuum tube!\u2019 \u201d He shook his head wonderingly, admiringly. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me art is dying.\u201d\n\u201cArt who?\u201d said Paul under his breath, and he walked away from them, into the twilight at the fringe of the ring of floodlights. The rest of the crowd drifted, tightly packed, toward the shore, where Luke Lubbock, Alfy, and others of the service staff were pouring kerosene on a hillock of pine fagots.\nThe play was virtually the same play that had begun every Meadows session, even before the war, when the island had belonged to a steel company. Twenty years ago, Paul\u2019s father had brought him up here, and the play\u2019s message had been the same: that the common man wasn\u2019t nearly as grateful as he should be for what the engineers and managers had given him, and that the radicals were the cause of the ingratitude.\nWhen Paul had first seen the allegory, as a teen-ager, he\u2019d been moved deeply. He had been struck full force by its sublime clarity and simplicity. It was a story in a nutshell, and the heroic struggle against ingratitude was made so vivid for his young mind that he\u2019d worshipped his father for a little while as a fighter, a latter-day Richard the Lionhearted.\n\u201cWell,\u201d his father had said after that first play, years ago, \u201cwhat are you thinking, Paul?\u201d\n\u201cI had no idea\u2014no idea that\u2019s what was going on.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the story,\u201d his father had said sadly. \u201cThe whole story. That\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\u201cYessir.\u201d Their eyes had met, and an inexpressibly sweet sense of eternal tragedy had passed between them, between their generations\u2014a legacy of Weltschmerz as old as humanity.\nNow, Paul stood by himself on a dark walk, bewildered by the picture of, as Kroner put it, the men at the head of the procession of civilization, the openers of doors to undreamed-of new worlds. This silly playlet seemed to satisfy them completely as a picture of what they were doing, why they were doing it, and who was against them, and why some people were against them. It was a beautifully simple picture these procession leaders had. It was as though a navigator, in order to free his mind of worries, had erased all the reefs from his maps.\nSuddenly, light flashed in Paul\u2019s eyes, but less dazzling light than the Sky Manager\u2019s. He faced his own image in a mirror framed by fluorescent lamps. Over the mirror was the legend, THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD FOR THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD. The island was covered with such booby traps. The lamps about this mirror were old ones, and they gave off a wavering light tinged with greens and purples. They gave his skin the quality of corroded copper, and his lips and eye rims were lavender. He discovered that there was nothing disquieting about seeing himself dead. An awakening conscience, unaccompanied by new wisdom, made his life so damned lonely, he decided he wouldn\u2019t much mind being dead.

He knew he was going to fail.\nHe had been living cheerfully with artistic failure for years. He had managed to coat it with the sugar of ready cash. But now he was sure that his failure was going to be presented to him so nakedly, so dramatically, that he could only take it for the ghastly thing it was.\nHe did not doubt that Lazarro was now creating across the street a painting so well drawn, so vibrant, that even Cornelia and the demonstration crowds would be struck dumb. And Stedman would be so shamed that he would never touch a brush again.\nHe looked everywhere but at the canvas, studied the paintings and signs on the studio walls as though he had never seen them before. \u201cA ten percent deposit holds anything Stedman does,\u201d said a sign. \u201cAt no extra charge,\u201d said a sign, \u201cStedman will work the colors of a customer\u2019s drapes, carpet, and upholstery into a sunset.\u201d\n\u201cStedman,\u201d said a sign, \u201cwill make a genuine oil painting from any photograph.\u201d Stedman found himself wondering who this bustling Stedman was.\nStedman now considered Stedman\u2019s work. One theme occurred in every painting\u2014a cunning little cottage with smoke coming from its fieldstone chimney. It was a sturdy little cottage that no wolf could ever huff and puff down. And the cottage seemed to say, no matter where Stedman set it down, \u201cCome in, weary stranger, whoever you are\u2014come in and rest your bones.\u201d\nStedman wished he could drag himself inside the cottage, close the doors and shutters, and huddle before the fire.

He was consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress from 1978 until 1980.\nDear Bill\u2014\nYears ago I wrote in Slaughterhouse-Five that Billy Pilgrim would die on such and such a date. It seemed like a long time in the future when I wrote it. The date was yesterday, February 13, 1976. I thought I might actually die. Guess who got it instead? Sal Mineo.\nReally: I would have forgotten that prediction, if sympathy cards hadn\u2019t come trickling in, consoling me about the coming death of Billy Pilgrim.\nAs for the unsuitability of my attending meetings: I know Robert\u2019s Rules of Order cold. Those rules were first published, incidentally, almost a century ago\u2014on February 19, 1876. I did almost nothing in high school but attend meetings, seconding motions and so on. So I was perfectly content with the solemn tomfoolery of our Institute Meetings until the business of the National Book Awards came up. It seemed to me that this was an extremely daring enterprise, and that, if it was going to be a success, all persons concerned should be enthusiasts. When the going got tough, I suspected, I would find myself wandering absent-mindedly in a rear area like the late Private Slovik.\nI am so glad to be friends with poets at last.

The car was a sports car, windy and skittish, with room for two. He had bought it secondhand, against his father\u2019s wish. His father had never ridden in it.
