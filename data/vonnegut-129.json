It was so cold inside. These words popped into my head: \u201cDead storage.\u201d\nI heard Felix call from the balcony: \u201cAnybody home?\u201d And then, as I came down from the gun room, he looked up at me, and he said, haggardly, \u201cNice to be home again.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe found Mother and Father at the County Hospital. Father was dying of double pneumonia, coupled with kidney failure. Mother had frostbitten fingers and feet. Father was very sick before the blizzard ever hit, and had been about to go to the hospital anyway.\nBefore the streets became completely impassable, Mother had walked out into the storm in a bathrobe and bedroom slippers and a nightgown, with the Hungarian Life Guard tunic over her shoulders and the sable busby on her head. She was out there long enough to suffer frostbite, but she managed to flag down a snowplow. And the snow-plow took her and Father, all bundled up in bedclothes, to the hospital, which had its own diesel-powered electric plant.\nWhen Felix and I came into the lobby of the hospital, not knowing if our parents were there or not, we were appalled by the mess. Hundreds of healthy people had sought shelter there, although nobody was supposed to go there unless seriously ill. The sanitary facilities were swamped, and the refugees had begun to infest the entire hospital, in search of food and water and places to lie down.\nThese were my people. They had become pioneers again. They were starting a new settlement.\nThey were ten deep at the information counter, which Felix and I were trying to approach, too. You would have thought it was a bar on the Klondike. So I told Felix that I would keep trying to get up to the counter, while he went looking for familiar faces which might have news of our parents.\nI had a feeling, while I inched forward in the crowd, that invisible insects were buzzing around my head. The hospital lobby was surely hot and humid enough for real insects, but the ones that nagged and niggled around me were a condition of my spirit. There had been no such swarms in New York City, but here they were again in my own hometown.

and completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have above ground in any city, said Harry Truman. We shall destroy their docks, their factories, and their communications. Let there be no mistake; we shall completely destroy Japan\u2019s power to make war. It was to spare\u2014\nAnd so on.\nOne of the books that Lily had brought Rumfoord was The Destruction of Dresden, by an Englishman named David Irving. It was an American edition, published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston in 1964. What Rumfoord wanted from it were portions of the forewords by his friends Ira C. Eaker, Lieutenant General, U.S.A.F., retired, and British Air Marshal Sir Robert Saundby, K.C.B., K.B.E., M.C., D.F.C., A.F.C.\nI find it difficult to understand Englishmen or Americans who weep about enemy civilians who were killed but who have not shed a tear for our gallant crews lost in combat with a cruel enemy, wrote his friend General Eaker in part. I think if would have been well for Mr. Irving to have remembered, when he was drawing the frightful picture of the civilians killed at Dresden, that V-1\u2019s and V-2\u2019s were at the very time falling on England, killing civilian men, women, and children indiscriminately, as they were designed and launched to do. It might be well to remember Buchenwald and Coventry, too.\nEaker\u2019s foreword ended this way:\nI deeply regret that British and U.S. bombers killed 135,000 people in the attack on Dresden, but I remember who started the last war and I regret even more the loss of more than 5,000,000 Allied lives in the necessary effort to completely defeat and utterly destroy nazism.\nSo it goes.\nWhat Air Marshal Saundby said, among other things, was this:\nThat the bombing of Dresden was a great tragedy none can deny. That it was really a military necessity few, after reading this book, will believe. It was one of those terrible things that sometimes happen in wartime, brought about by an unfortunate combination of circumstances. Those who approved it were neither wicked nor cruel, though it may well be that they were too remote from the harsh realities of war to understand fully the appalling destructive power of air bombardment in the spring of 1945.\nThe advocates of nuclear disarmament seem to believe that, if they could achieve their aim, war would become tolerable and decent. They would do well to read this book and ponder the fate of Dresden, where 135,000 people died as the result of an air attack with conventional weapons. On the night of March 9th, 1945, an air attack on Tokyo by American heavy bombers, using incendiary and high explosive bombs, caused the death of 83,793 people. The atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima killed 71,379 people.", -0.0775330687830688], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["flashlight", 0.11694280802713035], ["stony", 0.0872192555985805], ["unk", 0.07799588913692254], ["beam", 0.07300183628615965], ["fangs", 0.048451731601009906], ["spilling", 0.048451731601009906], ["whirlwind", 0.048451731601009906], ["gayly", 0.048451731601009906], ["contrasting", 0.048451731601009906], ["assured", 0.048451731601009906], ["leaped", 0.048451731601009906], ["toed", 0.048451731601009906], ["gasped", 0.048451731601009906], ["warmly", 0.048451731601009906], ["swaggerstick", 0.048451731601009906], ["rush", 0.048451731601009906], ["demon", 0.048451731601009906], ["flattened", 0.048451731601009906], ["neighboring", 0.048451731601009906], ["man", 0.044630749441662856], ["face", 0.04360962779929025], ["air", 0.04284321809979311], ["shadows", 0.04247632487204487], ["marine", 0.04247632487204487], ["illuminated", 0.04247632487204487], ["yodel", 0.04247632487204487], ["chin", 0.04247632487204487], ["long", 0.04079352408317068], ["recollection", 0.038980936009043454], ["marvelously", 0.038980936009043454], ["glottal", 0.038980936009043454], ["fearless", 0.038980936009043454], ["threat", 0.038980936009043454], ["unarmed", 0.038980936009043454], ["bay", 0.036500918143079826], ["yards", 0.036500918143079826], ["vaguely", 0.036500918143079826], ["tenor", 0.036500918143079826], ["dog", 0.035118653918293795], ["save", 0.03457726683864698], ["boots", 0.03457726683864698], ["dancing", 0.03457726683864698], ["blood", 0.03457726683864698], ["knew", 0.03418646044811663], ["ski", 0.033005529280078404], ["shaped", 0.033005529280078404], ["parachute", 0.033005529280078404], ["hello", 0.033005529280078404], ["soft", 0.031676644109153766], ["square", 0.031676644109153766], ["appeared", 0.031676644109153766], ["master", 0.031676644109153766], ["sides", 0.031676644109153766], ["smile", 0.029510140417076985], ["wished", 0.029510140417076985], ["stepped", 0.029510140417076985], ["command", 0.029510140417076985], ["wet", 0.028601860109681933], ["time", 0.02841238677589939], ["stopped", 0.02703012255111336], ["laughed", 0.02703012255111336], ["uniform", 0.026340099209100114], ["ground", 0.025701237380188716], ["black", 0.025701237380188716], ["foot", 0.025701237380188716], ["whispered", 0.025701237380188716], ["shook", 0.025106471246680518], ["gold", 0.024550104685149732], ["side", 0.024550104685149732], ["wore", 0.02402747863500805], ["space", 0.023791047411846563], ["ships", 0.023534733688111945], ["dark", 0.023534733688111945], ["stevenson", 0.023534733688111945], ["red", 0.023534733688111945], ["cried", 0.023068636953023358], ["held", 0.0222058485171873], ["ship", 0.02135127984557359], ["voice", 0.021054715822148313], ["kazak", 0.020039344825110526], ["friend", 0.01942331927354031], ["small", 0.018848393631310377], ["light", 0.018574697956184685], ["best", 0.018309425036643706], ["big", 0.017323128905801084], ["turned", 0.014901556617297616], ["god", 0.014727395347318999]], "sentiment": ["\"Kazak!\" cried a man in the dark.\nThe dog stopped at the command, but he held Unk at bay, kept Unk flattened against the space ship with the threat of his long, wet fangs.\nThe dog\u2019s master appeared, the beam of a flashlight dancing before him.

He turned the flashlight off, stepped to one side so that he was illuminated by the light spilling from the space ship. He was big, vaguely soft, marvelously self-assured.

It would soon be time for Mary Hepburn to relieve him at the wheel, at which time he would give her these instructions: \u201cKeep the sun over the stern all morning, and over the bow all afternoon.\u201d And the Captain saw as his most pressing task the earning of his passengers\u2019 respect. They had seen him at his very worst. By the time they docked at Baltra, he hoped, they would have forgotten his drunkenness, and would be telling one and all that he had saved their lives.\nThat was another thing people used to be able to do, which they can\u2019t do anymore: enjoy in their heads events which hadn\u2019t happened yet and which might never occur. My mother was good at that. Someday my father would stop writing science fiction, and write something a whole lot of people wanted to read instead. And we would get a new house in a beautiful city, and nice clothes, and so on. She used to make me wonder why God had ever gone to all the trouble of creating reality.\nQuoth Mandarax:\nImagination is as good as many voyages\u2014and how much cheaper!\n\u2014GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS (1824\u20131892)\nSo there the Captain was, half naked on the bridge of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, but in his head he was on the island of Manhattan, where most of his money and so many of his friends were anyway. He was going to get there somehow from Baltra, and buy himself a nice apartment on Park Avenue, and the hell with Ecuador.\nReality intruded now. A very real sun was coming up. There was one small trouble with the sun. The Captain had imagined all night that he was sailing due west, which meant that the sun would be rising squarely astern. This particular sun, however, was astern, all right, but also very much to starboard. So he turned the ship to port until the sun was where it was supposed to be. His big brain, which was responsible for the error he corrected, assured his soul that its mistake was minor and very recent, and had happened because the stars were dimmed by dawn. His big brain wanted the respect of his soul as much as he wanted the respect of his passengers. His brain had a life of its own, and the time would come when he would actually try to fire it for having misled him.\nBut that time was still five days away.\nHe still trusted it when he went aft to learn how \u201cWillard Flemming\u201d was, and to help Mary, according to plan, move him into the shade of the gangway between the officers\u2019 cabins. I do not put a star before the name of Willard Flemming, since there wasn\u2019t really such an individual\u2014so he couldn\u2019t die.", 0.20586697086697084], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard":

Czechoslovakia and then Poland and then France, and I was a pipsqueak casualty in faraway New York City. Coulomb Fr\u00e8res et Cie was out of business, so I lost my job at the agency\u2014not that long after my father\u2019s Moslem obsequies. So I joined what was still a peacetime United States Army, and scored high on their classification test. The Great Depression was as discouraging as ever, and the Army was still a very little family in this country, so I was lucky to be accepted. The recruiting sergeant on Times Square, I remember, had indicated that I might be a more attractive relative in prospect if I were to have my name legally changed to something more American.\nI even remember his helpful suggestion: that I become \u201cRobert King.\u201d Just think: somebody might now be trespassing on my private beach and gazing in awe at this mansion, and wondering who could be rich enough to live this well, and the answer could so easily have been this: \u201cRobert King.\u201d\nBut the Army adopted me as Rabo Karabekian\u2014as I was soon to discover, for this reason: Major General Daniel Whitehall, then the commander of the combat troops of the Corps of Engineers, wanted an oil painting of himself in full uniform, and believed that somebody with a foreign-sounding name could do the best job. As an Army regular, of course, I would have to paint him for free. And this was a man ravenous for immortality. He was going to be retired in six months, by reason of failing kidneys, having barely missed service in two world wars.\nGod only knows what became of the portrait I did of him\u2014after hours during basic training. I used the most expensive materials, which he was more than glad to buy for me. There is one painting of mine which might actually outlive the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d! If I had realized that at the time I might have given him a puzzling half-smile, whose meaning only I knew for certain: he had become a general, but had missed the two big wars of his lifetime.\nAnother painting of mine which just might outlive the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d for better or for worse, is the gigantic son of a bitch out in the potato barn.\nSo much I only now realize! When I did the portrait of General Whitehall in a mansion nearly as grand as this one, which was the property of the Army, I was stereotypically Armenian! Welcome home to my true nature! I was a scrawny recruit and he was a Pasha weighing more than two hundred pounds, who could squash me like an insect anytime he pleased.\nBut what sly and self-serving advice, but actually very good advice, too, I was able to give him along with flattery on this order: \u201cYou have a very strong chin. Did you know that?\u201d\nIn what must surely have been the manner of powerless Armenian advisors in Turkish courts, I congratulated him on having ideas he might never have had before. An example: \u201cYou must be thinking very hard how important aerial photography is going to be, if war should come.\u201d War, of course, had come to practically everybody but the United States by then.", 0.22257314857761287], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["hum", 0.15095771376579784], ["existential", 0.10063847584386523], ["embarrassment", 0.08048045219857883], ["pointed", 0.050319237921932616], ["narcotic", 0.050319237921932616], ["beatniks", 0.050319237921932616], ["distaste", 0.050319237921932616], ["dense", 0.050319237921932616], ["ella", 0.050319237921932616], ["bloodhound", 0.050319237921932616], ["heroin", 0.050319237921932616], ["stewart", 0.050319237921932616], ["condemned", 0.050319237921932616], ["warning", 0.050319237921932616], ["degenerate", 0.050319237921932616], ["seductiveness", 0.050319237921932616], ["thurber", 0.050319237921932616], ["jokester", 0.050319237921932616], ["uncle", 0.04567091119149842], ["ease", 0.04396008947642853], ["accidentally", 0.04396008947642853], ["capability", 0.04396008947642853], ["punch", 0.04396008947642853], ["louisville", 0.04396008947642853], ["bookstore", 0.04396008947642853], ["disgraced", 0.04396008947642853], ["annoyed", 0.04396008947642853], ["imagining", 0.040240226099289414], ["uneasiness", 0.040240226099289414], ["crack", 0.040240226099289414], ["fabulously", 0.040240226099289414], ["columbus", 0.040240226099289414], ["offer", 0.040240226099289414], ["kentucky", 0.040240226099289414], ["dedicated", 0.040240226099289414], ["discussed", 0.040240226099289414], ["moving", 0.040240226099289414], ["smart", 0.03760094103092444], ["titan", 0.03760094103092444], ["finger", 0.03760094103092444], ["described", 0.03760094103092444], ["describe", 0.03760094103092444], ["stock", 0.03760094103092444], ["aunt", 0.03760094103092444], ["feel", 0.03648237379860871], ["smile", 0.035553752486757385], ["quote", 0.035553752486757385], ["sirens", 0.035553752486757385], ["advice", 0.035553752486757385], ["enthusiastic", 0.035553752486757385], ["alex", 0.03388107765378533], ["ohio", 0.03388107765378533], ["allows", 0.03388107765378533], ["10", 0.03388107765378533], ["critic", 0.03388107765378533], ["young", 0.03341716123598181], ["hours", 0.03246685123335176], ["owned", 0.03246685123335176], ["masterpiece", 0.03124179258542036], ["worst", 0.0301612142766462], ["twelve", 0.0301612142766462], ["working", 0.0301612142766462], ["essay", 0.02752192920828124], ["realize", 0.02752192920828124], ["understood", 0.02752192920828124], ["dumb", 0.02752192920828124], ["famous", 0.02678759244063411], ["spoke", 0.02678759244063411], ["entirely", 0.025474740664114173], ["wonderful", 0.025474740664114173], ["wrong", 0.025474740664114173], ["james", 0.024882644139916272], ["joke", 0.024882644139916272], ["relatives", 0.022387839410708554], ["supposed", 0.021553235940931243], ["making", 0.021553235940931243], ["head", 0.02078826705158215], ["lost", 0.020428443995130025], ["mine", 0.020082202454002992], ["matter", 0.020082202454002992], ["john", 0.01974855434234359], ["ago", 0.01911559221861009], ["best", 0.01744291738563803], ["writers", 0.017191550649967254], ["time", 0.016988875679864384], ["books", 0.01694688783269972], ["writer", 0.016476307150245128], ["called", 0.016249769420058232], ["friend", 0.01581281484217516], ["day", 0.015194087495427158], ["course", 0.014996782860372444], ["asked", 0.014996782860372444], ["indianapolis", 0.014996782860372444], ["thing", 0.014614464544770903], ["work", 0.0142474431262966], ["read", 0.013227024455560597], ["going", 0.01306746718297464], ["life", 0.01000319063135978], ["years", 0.00966954251970038], ["will", 0.008637634414868358]], "sentiment": ["The worst thing about a writer\u2019s having a joke-making capability, of course, as James Thurber of Columbus, Ohio, pointed out in an essay years ago, is this: No matter what is being discussed, the jokester is going to head for a punch line every time.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSome smart young critic will soon quote that line above against me, imagining that I am too dumb to realize that I have condemned myself, too dense to know that I have accidentally put my finger on what is awfully wrong with me.\nI am often asked to give advice to young writers who wish to be famous and fabulously well-to-do.

For the first time in his life, he was not annoyed by the existential hum.\nI would describe the hum that is with me all the time as embarrassment. I have somehow disgraced myself.\nMy Indianapolis relatives may actually feel that I have done so. They are not enthusiastic about my work. I have already described my Uncle John\u2019s distaste for it. As for my Uncle Alex: I dedicated The Sirens of Titan to him, and he said he could not read it.

He sensed it when Annie was depressed, though she never told him she was, and he would say just the right thing to cheer her. And when she was elated, he nourished her elation, and kept it alive for weeks instead of fleeting minutes.\nShe tried to do the same for him, and her fumbling efforts seemed to sit surprisingly well with her pen pal.\nNever once did Hawkins say a vulgar thing, nor did he harp on the fact of his being a man and her a woman. That was unimportant, he said vehemently. The important thing was that their spirits would never be lonely again, so splendidly were they matched. It was a very high-level correspondence\u2014on such a high level, in fact, that Annie and Hawkins went for an entire year without mentioning anything as down-to-earth as money, work, age, physical appearances, organized religion, or politics. Nature, Fate, and the undefinable sweet aches of the spirit were subject matter enough to keep them both writing on and on and on and on and on. The second winter without Ed seemed no worse than a chilly May to Annie, because, for the first time in her life, she had discovered what true friendship was like.\nWhen the correspondence finally came down to earth, it wasn\u2019t Joseph P. Hawkins who brought it down\u2014it was Annie. When spring came again, she was writing to him, as he had written to her, about the millions of tender little shoots poking their heads up, and about the mating songs of the birds and the budding of the trees, and the bees carrying pollen from one plant to the next\u2014when she suddenly felt compelled to do what Hawkins had forbidden her to do.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he had written, \u201clet us not descend to the vulgarity of, as I believe the phrase goes, \u2018exchanging snaps.\u2019 No photographer, save in Heaven, could ever take a picture of the angel that rises from your letters to blind me with adoration.\u201d\nBut one heady, warm spring night, Annie enclosed a snapshot anyway. The picture was one Ed had taken at a picnic five years before, and, at the time, she\u2019d thought it was a terrible likeness. But now, as she studied it before sealing her letter, she saw a great deal in the woman in the picture that she had not seen before\u2014a haze of spiritual beauty that softened every harsh line.\nThe next two days of waiting were nightmares. She hated herself for having sent the picture, and told herself that she was the ugliest woman on earth, that she had ruined everything between herself and Hawkins. Then she would try to calm herself by telling herself that the picture couldn\u2019t possibly make any difference\u2014that the relationship was purely spiritual, that she might as well have enclosed a blank sheet of paper, for all the difference the picture, beautiful or ugly, could make. But only Joseph P. Hawkins could say what the effect of the picture was.\nHe did so by special-delivery airmail. \u201cBright angel, adieu!\u201d he wrote, and Annie burst into tears.\nBut then she forced herself to read on. \u201cFrail, wispish counterfeit of my mind\u2019s eye, stand aside, dethroned by warm and earthly, vibrant bride of my mind\u2014my Annie as she really is! Adieu, ghost! Make way for life, for I live and Annie lives, and it is spring!\u201d\nAnnie was jubilant. She hadn\u2019t spoiled anything with the picture.

I knocked off the lock and hasp with a hammer. I lifted the lid of what was indeed a sort of casket to me. It contained the remains of the soldier I used to be. On top of everything else, lying flat and face up, was that copy of Black Garterbelt.\n\u201cWow,\u201d said the kid. He was awed by the woman on the magazine cover. He might have been an Astronaut on his first trip in space.\n\u201cHave you ever considered being a soldier?\u201d I asked him. \u201cI think you\u2019d make a good one.\u201d\nI NEVER SAW him again. He could have been fired soon after that, and gone looking for work elsewhere.

I didn\u2019t want to go into the house. I didn\u2019t want to go outdoors again, either. So I sat down on my footlocker and read \u201cThe Protocols of the Elders of Tralfamadore\u201d in Black Garterbelt. It was about intelligent threads of energy trillions of lightyears long. They wanted mortal, self-reproducing life forms to spread out through the Universe. So several of them, the Elders in the title, held a meeting by intersecting near a planet called Tralfamadore. The author never said why the Elders thought the spread of life was such a hot idea. I don\u2019t blame him. I can\u2019t think of any strong arguments in favor of it. To me, wanting every habitable planet to be inhabited is like wanting everybody to have athlete\u2019s foot.\nThe Elders agreed at the meeting that the only practical way for life to travel great distances through space was in the form of extremely small and durable plants and animals hitching rides on meteors that ricocheted off their planets.\nBut no germs tough enough to survive a trip like that had yet evolved anywhere. Life was too easy for them. They were a bunch of creampuffs.
