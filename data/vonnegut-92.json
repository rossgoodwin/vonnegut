It is now as widely dispersed as the Class of 1940 of Shortridge High School.\nAuf Wiedersehen.\n42\nI always had trouble ending short stories in ways that would satisfy a general public. In real life, as during a rerun following a timequake, people don\u2019t change, don\u2019t learn anything from their mistakes, and don\u2019t apologize. In a short story they have to do at least two out of three of those things, or you might as well throw it away in the lidless wire trash receptacle chained and padlocked to the fire hydrant in front of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\nOK, I could handle that. But after I had a character change and/or learn something and/or apologize, that left the cast standing around with their thumbs up their asses. That is no way to tell a reader the show is over.\nIn my salad days, when I was green in judgment, and never having asked to be born in the first place, I sought the advice of my then literary agent as to how to end stories without killing all the characters.

My brother was.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI agree now that Katmandu was a ridiculous play. What made me keep working on it so long, even after I graduated and went to work as the night man at Schramm\u2019s Drugstore, were the lines at the very end. They so much deserved to be spoken in a theater. They weren\u2019t even my lines. They were the last words of John Fortune himself, which I found in an old Bugle-Observer.\nThe thing was this: He simply disappeared somewhere in Asia in 1938. He had sent postcards back from San Francisco, and then Honolulu, and then Fiji, and then Manila, and Madras, and so on. But then the cards stopped. The very last one came from Agra, India, the site of the Taj Mahal.\nOne letter I found in the paper, published in 1939, long before anybody in Midland City found out what finally happened to Fortune, said this: \u201cAt least he saw the Taj Mahal.\u201d\nBut then, right at the end of World War Two, the Bugle-Observer got a letter from a British doctor who had been a prisoner of the Japanese for years and years. His name was David Brokenshire. It is easy for me to remember that, since he became a character in my play.\nThis Dr. Brokenshire had walked all alone on the footpath to Katmandu. He was studying folk medicine. So he had been in Nepal for about a year, when some natives brought to him a white man on a stretcher. The man had collapsed in front of the palace. He had just arrived, and he had double pneumonia. It was John Fortune, of course, and his costume was so strange to both the Englishman and the Nepalese that he was asked to say what it was. The answer was this: \u201cPlain old, honest Ohio bib overalls.\u201d\nSo John Fortune\u2019s peephole closed and he was buried there in Katmandu, but not before he scrawled a message which Brokenshire promised to deliver sooner or later to the Bugle-Observer back in Midland City. But the doctor was in no hurry to get to the nearest mailbox. He went wandering into Tibet instead, and then northern Burma, and then China, where the Japanese captured him. They thought he was a spy. He didn\u2019t even know there was a war going on.\nHe wrote a book about it later. I read it. It is hard to find, but worth looking for. It is quite interesting.\nBut the point is that he didn\u2019t get to send John Fortune\u2019s last words, along with a map of where in Katmandu Fortune was buried, to Midland City until six years after Fortune\u2019s death.

Look how happy Irwin is.\n\u201cI know where a lot of that happiness is coming from, but some of it should surely be attributed to the fact that the publication of Irwin\u2019s collected short stories last year confirmed beyond a doubt that he is one of the greatest storytellers of all time.\n\u201cOh, I know it is cruel on a man\u2019s ninety-second birthday to talk about nothing but the work he did as a youngster. But I have done that tonight for selfish reasons, to celebrate my own youth, when I was so enthusiastic about so many things. That\u2019s what it was to be young\u2014to be enthusiastic rather than envious about the good work other people could do.\n\u201cAnd I was so enthusiastic about everything written by Irwin Shaw. He continues to write as well as ever, but I can no longer take pleasure in reading him, since he is my colleague now. I simply can\u2019t afford to like anybody but me. When I read anybody else now, I see his or her words only dimly, as though through a finely divided mist of sulfuric acid or mustard gas.\n\u201cI can see this much in Irwin\u2019s present work, though: Despite all the high living he has done far away from us, in Europe and the Hamptons and so on, he still knows how Americans talk and feel. This is highly unusual in our literary history. Almost every other important American writer who has lived elsewhere has soon lost touch with how we talk and feel.\n\u201cHow has he worked this miracle? I will have to guess, but I am almost sure I\u2019m right about this. Every time Irwin comes to New York, I think, he takes a job driving a taxicab.\n\u201cNow that I have let you in on his little secret, you won\u2019t be surprised if you find him driving you home after this banquet in his honor.\n\u201cI thank you for your attention.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd here is what I said about my friends Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding, perhaps the most significant and ridiculous American comedy team alive today, as an introduction to their book Write If You Get Work: The Best of Bob & Ray (Random House, 1975):", 0.18030026175375014], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["ruth", 0.11954721405280253], ["faulkner", 0.11054362655704811], ["sherry", 0.07799062347913432], ["ted", 0.07056569766934473], ["opening", 0.050583438281172156], ["afraid", 0.050583438281172156], ["edge", 0.048702714441390155], ["anticipation", 0.03899531173956716], ["insubstantial", 0.03899531173956716], ["sofa", 0.03899531173956716], ["absurdly", 0.03899531173956716], ["warmer", 0.03899531173956716], ["colonel", 0.03899531173956716], ["drawling", 0.03899531173956716], ["comforts", 0.03899531173956716], ["climate", 0.03899531173956716], ["tortoiseshell", 0.03899531173956716], ["polished", 0.03899531173956716], ["chintz", 0.03899531173956716], ["slippery", 0.03899531173956716], ["ordeal", 0.03899531173956716], ["pushes", 0.03899531173956716], ["decanter", 0.03899531173956716], ["cavalry", 0.03899531173956716], ["temporariness", 0.03899531173956716], ["muddled", 0.03899531173956716], ["mantel", 0.03899531173956716], ["conscious", 0.03899531173956716], ["customary", 0.034113993566609796], ["thoughtful", 0.034113993566609796], ["personal", 0.034113993566609796], ["winning", 0.034113993566609796], ["effects", 0.034113993566609796], ["ride", 0.034113993566609796], ["overheated", 0.034113993566609796], ["machines", 0.034113993566609796], ["staying", 0.034113993566609796], ["illumination", 0.034113993566609796], ["poured", 0.034113993566609796], ["affection", 0.034113993566609796], ["slid", 0.034113993566609796], ["foreign", 0.034113993566609796], ["relatives", 0.034113993566609796], ["suited", 0.034113993566609796], ["shade", 0.034113993566609796], ["unfinished", 0.03125860548134103], ["glasses", 0.03125860548134103], ["rehearsed", 0.03125860548134103], ["automatically", 0.03125860548134103], ["ironically", 0.03125860548134103], ["hotel", 0.03125860548134103], ["biography", 0.03125860548134103], ["overseas", 0.03125860548134103], ["childish", 0.03125860548134103], ["told", 0.029624606514554792], ["lamp", 0.029232675393652437], ["wished", 0.029232675393652437], ["easily", 0.029232675393652437], ["routine", 0.029232675393652437], ["gaze", 0.029232675393652437], ["washington", 0.029232675393652437], ["things", 0.027915298669424268], ["send", 0.027661241933693213], ["button", 0.027661241933693213], ["expensive", 0.027661241933693213], ["patiently", 0.027661241933693213], ["silent", 0.027661241933693213], ["frail", 0.027661241933693213], ["pretended", 0.027661241933693213], ["left", 0.027132624709497358], ["clothes", 0.026377287308383675], ["tiny", 0.026377287308383675], ["dozen", 0.026377287308383675], ["suitcase", 0.026377287308383675], ["born", 0.025291719140586078], ["mine", 0.025291719140586078], ["general", 0.025291719140586078], ["speech", 0.025291719140586078], ["sentence", 0.024351357220695077], ["covered", 0.024351357220695077], ["puzzled", 0.024351357220695077], ["dying", 0.024351357220695077], ["stay", 0.024351357220695077], ["simply", 0.02352189922311491], ["child", 0.02352189922311491], ["meet", 0.02277992376073585], ["close", 0.02210872531140962], ["glass", 0.02210872531140962], ["train", 0.02210872531140962], ["question", 0.021495969135426313], ["suppose", 0.020932288095471832], ["ready", 0.020410400967628715], ["air", 0.01992453567546709], ["light", 0.01992453567546709], ["thinking", 0.019470039047737715], ["moment", 0.019043105091283947], ["father", 0.01864058105015755], ["understand", 0.01864058105015755], ["hours", 0.018259825970789408], ["months", 0.018259825970789408], ["times", 0.018259825970789408], ["sound", 0.018259825970789408], ["place", 0.018259825970789408], ["inside", 0.017555012882359954], ["matter", 0.017555012882359954], ["wanted", 0.016914366556967514], ["feel", 0.016914366556967514], ["talking", 0.016914366556967514], ["sat", 0.01661465096246895], ["hear", 0.01605096992251447], ["talk", 0.015785192964888787], ["wouldn", 0.015043217502509726], ["small", 0.014812303257277396], ["mother", 0.014161786918326586], ["better", 0.013759262877200187], ["twenty", 0.013195581837245705], ["room", 0.013017287414821128], ["woman", 0.012507986981161791], ["long", 0.012507986981161791], ["wife", 0.011881596234566746], ["door", 0.011445853954861905], ["thought", 0.011169651749557108], ["looked", 0.00970740270182299], ["time", 0.007385196459763359]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI could just as easily stay at a hotel,\u201d said Ruth.

I was sure was my friend. He would have found what I said on tape funny and interesting. But he wasn\u2019t there. His name was Ed Bergeron, and we had had a lot of good talks about the deterioration of the environment and the abuses of trust in the stock market and the banking industry and so on. He could top me for pessimism any day.\nHis wealth was as old as the Moellenkamps\u2019, and was based on ancestral oil fields and coal mines and railroads which he had sold to foreigners in order to devote himself full-time to nature study and conservation. He was President of the Wildlife Rescue Federation, and his photographs of wildlife on the Galapagos Islands had been published in National Geographic. The magazine gave him the cover, too, which showed a marine iguana digesting seaweed in the sunshine, right next to a skinny penguin who was no doubt having thoughts about entirely different issues of the day, whatever was going on that day.\nNot only was Ed Bergeron my doomsday pal. He was also a veteran of several debates about environmentalism with Jason Wilder on Wilder\u2019s TV show. I haven\u2019t found a tape of any of those ding-dong head-to-heads in this library, but there used to be 1 at the prison. It would bob up about every 6 months on the TV sets there, which were running all the time.\nIn it, I remember, Wilder said that the trouble with conservationists was that they never considered the costs in terms of jobs and living standards of eliminating fossil fuels or doing something with garbage other than dumping it in the ocean, and so on.\nEd Bergeron said to him, \u201cGood! Then I can write the epitaph for this once salubrious blue-green orb.\u201d He meant the planet.\nWilder gave him his supercilious, vulpine, patronizing, silky debater\u2019s grin. \u201cA majority of the scientific community,\u201d he said, \u201cwould say, if I\u2019m not mistaken, that an epitaph would be premature by several thousand years.\u201d That debate took place maybe 6 years before I was fired, which would be back in 1985, and I don\u2019t know what scientific community he was talking about. Every kind of scientist, all the way down to chiropractors and podiatrists, was saying we were killing the planet fast.\n\u201cYou want to hear the epitaph?\u201d said Ed Bergeron.\n\u201cIf we must,\u201d said Wilder, and the grin went on and on. \u201cI have to tell you, though, that you are not the first person to say the game was all over for the human race. I\u2019m sure that even in Egypt before the first pyramid was constructed, there were men who attracted a following by saying, \u2018It\u2019s all over now.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cWhat is different about now as compared with Egypt before the first pyramid was built\u2014\u201d Ed began.", 0.14718180482069373], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["bane", 0.23963709978018652], ["farmer", 0.20408310229519358], ["inscription", 0.1107612308918584], ["watch", 0.09906308692876059], ["copy", 0.09585483991207462], ["duty", 0.08713516016781302], ["german", 0.06473830264462675], ["sooty", 0.06283381093582108], ["proprietor", 0.06283381093582108], ["tissue", 0.06283381093582108], ["cops", 0.06283381093582108], ["machinery", 0.06283381093582108], ["legible", 0.06283381093582108], ["headfirst", 0.06283381093582108], ["dive", 0.06283381093582108], ["streaks", 0.06283381093582108], ["salesmanship", 0.06283381093582108], ["spattering", 0.06283381093582108], ["whirring", 0.06283381093582108], ["attempt", 0.06283381093582108], ["loitering", 0.06283381093582108], ["pried", 0.06283381093582108], ["engraved", 0.06283381093582108], ["county", 0.0553806154459292], ["clumsy", 0.0553806154459292], ["casually", 0.0553806154459292], ["shoeshine", 0.0553806154459292], ["drops", 0.0553806154459292], ["translation", 0.0553806154459292], ["schoolteacher", 0.0553806154459292], ["nearest", 0.051020775573798395], ["chimes", 0.051020775573798395], ["striking", 0.051020775573798395], ["pencil", 0.051020775573798395], ["foreign", 0.051020775573798395], ["rain", 0.04792741995603731], ["language", 0.04792741995603731], ["sheet", 0.045528026931153334], ["reddened", 0.045528026931153334], ["listened", 0.04356758008390651], ["dime", 0.04191004589221556], ["tiny", 0.04191004589221556], ["restaurant", 0.04191004589221556], ["pressed", 0.04191004589221556], ["button", 0.040474224466145424], ["clean", 0.039207740211775706], ["uh", 0.039207740211775706], ["rubbed", 0.03807483144126145], ["huh", 0.03807483144126145], ["block", 0.03807483144126145], ["check", 0.03704999079820419], ["ain", 0.03611438459401462], ["deal", 0.03445685040232367], ["sweet", 0.03445685040232367], ["picked", 0.03445685040232367], ["clear", 0.03445685040232367], ["close", 0.033714991569130645], ["laid", 0.03302102897625354], ["mine", 0.03175454472188382], ["glass", 0.03175454472188382], ["paper", 0.031173176751235696], ["hour", 0.031173176751235696], ["paid", 0.031173176751235696], ["case", 0.03062163595136956], ["bought", 0.03009701053019287], ["idea", 0.0295967953083123], ["inside", 0.0295967953083123], ["point", 0.028661189104122735], ["open", 0.02822224292648558], ["side", 0.02739470484975302], ["war", 0.02626179607923876], ["pretty", 0.024006736606313285], ["door", 0.020769047436593698], ["kind", 0.020769047436593698], ["wanted", 0.02055611596029069], ["young", 0.019941509359861134], ["lot", 0.01974420679353644], ["boy", 0.016266785771451922], ["looked", 0.015581669487730335], ["man", 0.010249411707630171]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThere ain\u2019t another one like it in the whole county,\u201d said the farmer, in a clumsy attempt at salesmanship.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my point,\u201d said Bane. \u201cWho wants a watch like this?\u201d Bane, for one, wanted it, and was already regarding it as his own.

Dwayne didn\u2019t know who Patty was. Patty\u2019s heart beat faster when she waited on him\u2014because Dwayne could solve so many of her problems with the money and power he had. He could give her a fine house and new automobiles and nice clothes and a life of leisure, and he could pay all the medical bills\u2014as easily as she had given him his hamburger and his French fries and his Coke.\nDwayne could do for her what the Fairy Godmother did for Cinderella, if he wanted to, and Patty had never been so close to such a magical person before. She was in the presence of the supernatural. And she knew enough about Midland City and herself to understand that she might never be this close to the supernatural ever again.\nPatty Keene actually imagined Dwayne\u2019s waving a magic wand at her troubles and dreams. It looked like this:\nShe spoke up bravely, to learn if supernatural assistance was possible in her case. She was willing to do without it, expected to do without it\u2014to work hard all her life, to get not much in return, and to associate with other men and women who were poor and powerless, and in debt. She said this to Dwayne:\n\u201cExcuse me for calling you by name, Mr. Hoover, but I can\u2019t help knowing who you are, with your picture in all your ads and everything. Besides\u2014everybody else who works here told me who you were. When you came in, they just buzzed and buzzed.\u201d\n\u201cBuzzed,\u201d said Dwayne. This was his echolalia again.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cI guess that isn\u2019t the right word,\u201d she said. She was used to apologizing for her use of language. She had been encouraged to do a lot of that in school. Most white people in Midland City were insecure when they spoke, so they kept their sentences short and their words simple, in order to keep embarrassing mistakes to a minimum. Dwayne certainly did that. Patty certainly did that.\nThis was because their English teachers would wince and cover their ears and give them flunking grades and so on whenever they failed to speak like English aristocrats before the First World War. Also: they were told that they were unworthy to speak or write their language if they couldn\u2019t love or understand incomprehensible novels and poems and plays about people long ago and far away,

glorious?\u201d said Private George Fisher, raising one eyebrow, as though he\u2019d said something pretty deep. He was scratching his back on a strand of barbed-wire, thinking about something else, I guess. Food and cigarettes, probably, and maybe even women.\nIt wasn\u2019t very smart to be seen talking with George anymore. He didn\u2019t have any friends left in camp, and anybody who tried to be buddies with him was likely to wind up in the same lonely spot. All of us were milling around, and George and I just happened\u2014I thought then\u2014to come together there by the gate.\nThe Germans had made him head American in our prison camp. They said it was because he could speak German. At any rate, he made a good thing out of it. He was a lot fatter than the rest of us\u2014so he probably was thinking about women. Nobody else had mentioned the subject since about a month after we\u2019d been captured. Everybody but George had been living on potatoes for eight months, so, like I said, the subject of women was about as popular as the subject of raising orchids or playing the zither.\nThe way I felt then, if Betty Grable had showed up and said she was all mine, I would have told her to make me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Only it wasn\u2019t Betty that was on her way to see George and me that day\u2014it was the Russian Army. The two of us, standing on the road shoulder in front of the prison gate, were listening to the tanks whining in the valley, just starting to climb up to where we were.\nThe big guns to the north, that had been rattling the prison windowpanes for a week, were quiet now, and our guards had disappeared during the night. Before that, the only traffic on the road had been a few farmers\u2019 carts. Now it was packed with jostling, yelling people\u2014pushing, stumbling, swearing; trying to cross the hills to Prague before the Russians caught them.\nFear like that can spread, too, to people who don\u2019t have anything to be afraid of. All of the people running from the Russians weren\u2019t Germans. I remember a British lance corporal, for instance, who George and I saw strutting toward Prague as though the Devil was after him.\n\u201cBetter get a move on, Yanks!\u201d he puffed. \u201cRooskies only a couple of miles back, you know. Don\u2019t want to mix it with them, do you?\u201d\nOne nice thing about being half-starved, which I gather the lance corporal wasn\u2019t, is that it\u2019s hard to worry about anything but being half-starved. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong, Mac,\u201d I shouted back at him. \u201cWe\u2019re on their side, the way I understand it.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not asking where you\u2019re from, Yank. They\u2019re shooting everything they can catch for the fun of it.\u201d He rounded the bend and was out of sight.\nI laughed, but I was in for a surprise when I turned back to George.

That was something none of us had ever seen before\u2014George afraid.", 0.004533730158730154], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
