I knew something that Leen himself did not know, that probably nobody in the world but me knew. It was impossible, but it had to be true: Mary Kathleen O\u2019Looney and Mrs. Jack Graham were the same.\nIt was then that Arpad Leen raised my hand to his lips and kissed it. \u201cForgive me for penetrating your disguise, madam,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I assume you made it so easy to penetrate on purpose. Your secret is safe with me. I am honored at last to meet you face to face.\u201d\nHe kissed my hand again, the same hand Mary Kathleen\u2019s dirty little claw had grasped that morning. \u201cHigh time, madam,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have worked together so well so long. High time.\u201d\nMy revulsion at being kissed by a man was so fully automatic that I became a veritable Queen Victoria!

Arpad Leen had now lost his in a matter of seconds, with this preposterous misapprehension of his.\nHe was speechless and white.\nWhen he tried to recover, he did not recover much. He was beyond apologizing, too shattered to exhibit charm or cleverness of any kind. He could only grope for where the truth might lie.\n\u201cBut you know her,\u201d he said at last. There was resignation in his voice, for he was acknowledging what was becoming clear to me, too: that I was more powerful than he was, if I wanted to be.\nI confirmed this for him. \u201cI know her well,\u201d I said. \u201cShe will do whatever I tell her, I\u2019m sure.\u201d This last was gratuitous. It was vengeful.\nHe was still a very sick man. I had come between his God and him.

Dwayne\u2019s rampage, there were three such crosses inside the cocktail lounge\u2014for Bunny and Beatrice Keedsler and Bonnie MacMahon.\nThen Dwayne ran out onto the asphalt between the Inn and his used car lot. He yelled for Niggers out there, telling them to come at once. \u201cI want to talk to you,\u201d he said.\nHe was out there all alone. Nobody from the cocktail lounge had followed him yet. Mary Alice Miller\u2019s father, Don Miller, was in his car near Dwayne, waiting for Mary Alice to come back with her crown and scepter, but he never saw anything of the show Dwayne put on. His car had seats whose backs could be made to lie flat. They could be made into beds. Don was lying on his back, with his head well below window level, resting, staring at the ceiling. He was trying to learn French by means of listening to lessons recorded on tape.\n\u201cDemain nous allons passer la soir\u00e9e au cin\u00e9ma,\u201d said the tape, and Don tried to say it, too. \u201cNous esp\u00e9rons que notre grand-p\u00e8re vivra encore longtemps,\u201d said the tape. And so on.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDwayne went on calling for Niggers to come talk to him. He smiled. He thought that the Creator of the Universe had programmed them all to hide, as a joke.\nDwayne glanced around craftily. Then he called out a signal he had used as a child to indicate that a game of hide-and-seek was over, that it was time for children in hiding to go home.\nHere is what he called, and the sun was down when he called it: \u201cOlly-olly-ox-in-freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.\u201d\nThe person who answered this incantation was a person who had never played hide-and-seek in his life. It was Wayne Hoobler, who came out from among the used cars quietly. He clasped his hands behind his back and placed his feet apart. He assumed the position known as parade rest. This position was taught to soldiers and prisoners alike\u2014as a way of demonstrating attentiveness, gullibility, respect, and voluntary defenselessness. He was ready for anything, and wouldn\u2019t mind death.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d said Dwayne, and his eyes crinkled in bittersweet amusement. He didn\u2019t know who Wayne was. He welcomed him as a typical black robot. Any other black robot would have served as well. And Dwayne again carried on a wry talk with the Creator of the Universe, using a robot as an unfeeling conversation piece. A lot of people in Midland City put useless objects from Hawaii or Mexico or someplace like that on their coffee tables or their livingroom end tables or on what-not shelves\u2014and such an object was called a conversation piece.", -0.050264550264550255], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["coast", 0.20133882620830934], ["commodore", 0.18584122919079216], ["guard", 0.1504667358846782], ["navy", 0.14564743647994793], ["william", 0.1261221637881185], ["taft", 0.11983642994828161], ["howard", 0.11983642994828161], ["clarice", 0.11470061144704345], ["port", 0.10659689109628905], ["hyannis", 0.09292061459539608], ["ski", 0.08258635458588869], ["powered", 0.08258635458588869], ["freight", 0.07282371823997397], ["1946", 0.07282371823997397], ["sole", 0.07282371823997397], ["stinkpots", 0.06711294206943645], ["whistle", 0.06306108189405925], ["fleet", 0.06306108189405925], ["secretary", 0.06306108189405925], ["mission", 0.05991821497414081], ["train", 0.05991821497414081], ["protect", 0.05991821497414081], ["yacht", 0.05991821497414081], ["sigh", 0.057350305723521726], ["cottage", 0.057350305723521726], ["kennedys", 0.05517916938792653], ["pardon", 0.0516395295529842], ["rumfoord", 0.0516395295529842], ["sounded", 0.0516395295529842], ["imagine", 0.0516395295529842], ["house", 0.05079403281835713], ["storm", 0.047587669377607], ["private", 0.04646030729769804], ["club", 0.04646030729769804], ["wet", 0.04646030729769804], ["kennedy", 0.045416533042011806], ["story", 0.043535809202229804], ["windows", 0.04268194128932227], ["order", 0.040392942282311356], ["morning", 0.03970575687147428], ["water", 0.03905054538365889], ["smile", 0.03725007536239291], ["full", 0.03565389669609709], ["high", 0.03422033762130917], ["days", 0.032114256861154745], ["knew", 0.030282522660475906], ["call", 0.028358923575887863], ["father", 0.02614504211782572], ["called", 0.02614504211782572], ["couldn", 0.025397016409178564], ["big", 0.024919529765859108], ["asked", 0.024232344355022035], ["left", 0.023365331777565227], ["wife", 0.02295105170423715], ["told", 0.021405996531611453], ["thing", 0.01920875359532158]], "sentiment": ["I told him, and, the next thing I knew, I had an order for storm windows all around on a four-story house in Hyannis Port.

I called it \u201cHungarian Rhapsody Number Six,\u201d which was bought by the Guggenheim Museum.\nThat picture was in storage when it started to fall apart like all the rest of them. A woman curator just happened to walk by and see all this tape and flakes of Sateen Dura-Luxe on the floor, so she called me up to ask what could be done to restore the picture, and whether they might be at fault someway. I didn\u2019t know where she had been the past year, when my pictures had become notorious for falling apart everywhere.

MISPERCEIVED\nIS IT POSSIBLE FOR A MAN of my eminence to write so badly that he is rejected? Yes, indeed. It takes some doing, though. As my own vanity publisher, I intend to thrust one such fizzle into our culture anyway. It is an essay on Jonathan Swift, which I submitted as a preface for a new edition of Gulliver\u2019s Travels.\nThe publisher\u2019s objection was that I had sentimentalized Swift, having failed, apparently, to have read any detailed accounts of his Ufe and character. Here is how I did it:\n\u201cGo, traveler,\u201d says his epitaph in Latin, \u201cand imitate, if you can, one who strove with all his strength to champion liberty.\u201d Jonathan Swift (1667-1745), an Anglican priest, wrote this about his own long life. He is buried beside his wife in Dublin\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, where he was dean for his final thirty-two years. It was in Dublin that he wrote Gulliver\u2019s Travels, a book as enduring as any cathedral. The appointment to St. Patrick\u2019s had disappointed him. He had hoped for a bishopric in England. Be that as it may, he became, according to Swift scholar Ricardo B. Quintana, \u201cDublin\u2019s foremost citizen and Ireland\u2019s great patriotic dean.\u201d In our own thin-skinned and solemn society, it would be impossible for such a ferocious satirist to become the head of a cathedral and a treasured public man.\nHe began to write Gulliver\u2019s Travels when he was about my age, which is fifty-four. He finished it when he was sixty. He was already recognized as one of the most bitterly funny writers of his or any time. His motives were invariably serious, however, and I now suggest that Gulliver\u2019s Travels can be read as a series of highly responsible sermons, delivered during a crisis in Christian attitudes, one that is far from over yet. The crisis is this, in my opinion: It simply will not do for adult Christians to think of themselves as God\u2019s little lambs anymore.\nSwift died before the invention of the steam engine or the iron plow\u2014or of the Constitution of the United States, for that matter. But he was aware of microscopes and telescopes and the calculus, and Harvey\u2019s theories about the circulation of human blood, and Newton\u2019s laws of motion, and all that. There were certainly strong hints around that the natural orders of things, so long so stubborn and mysterious, might in fact be wonderful clocks which could be tinkered with, which might even be taken apart and reassembled. Human reason was in the process of assuming powers to change life such as only armies and disasters had possessed before. So Dublin\u2019s first citizen found it urgent that we take an unsentimental look, for the good of the universe, at the great apes that were suddenly doing such puissant thinking. Lambs, indeed!\nIn Gulliver\u2019s Travels, Swift sets such high standards for unsentimentality about human beings that most of us can meet those standards only in wartime, and only briefly even then. He shrinks us, urinates on us, expands us and peers into all our nauseating apertures, encourages us to demonstrate our stupidity and mendaciousness, makes us hideously old. On paper he subjects us to every humiliating test that imaginative fiction can invent. And what is learned about us in the course of these Auschwitzian experiments? Only this, according to Swift\u2019s hero, Captain Gulliver: that we are disgusting in the extreme. We can be sure that this is not Swift\u2019s own opinion of us, thank God\u2014for, before he allows Gulliver to declare us no better than vomit, he makes Gulliver insane. That has to be the deepest meaning of Gulliver\u2019s adoration of horses, since Swift himself had no more than average respect for those dazed and skittish animals.

The book really is kinkily erotic, but it would take me a while to explain why. Anyway, Harper & Row thought it might sell books, so they used it.\nIt\u2019s tough finding teaching jobs these days, I hear, but you deserve a good job. I\u2019ll mention you to English faculties whenever I get the chance. As for the play you\u2019re doing with Coover: I think plays are really it these days. They\u2019re so sociable.
