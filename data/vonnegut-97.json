You might give the next guy who wants to buy a painting from you a lesson in art appreciation that goes like this: A small tube of paint costs a dollar, a canvas costs two dollars, and the minimum legal wage in this country is now a dollar and a quarter an hour. Percy Leen did me the big favor of admiring my paintings and actually hanging them on her walls. I figure this honor cost me about forty bucks or more every time she awarded it to me. Americans have yet to catch on to the fact that painters actually have to pay for their materials, just as though they were in business or something. Jack Teagarden, the guy everybody agrees was the greatest living trombone player by far, died broke about a week ago. He didn\u2019t take dope. He wasn\u2019t a drunk.

A local microbrewery, Wynkoop, bottled a special beer for the occasion. The label was one of my self-portraits. The name of the beer was Kurt\u2019s Mile-High Malt.\nYou think that wasn\u2019t fun? Try this: The beer, at my suggestion, was lightly flavored with coffee. What was so great about that? It tasted really good, for one thing, but it was also an homage to my maternal grandfather Albert Lieber, who was a brewer until he was put out of business by Prohibition in 1920. The secret ingredient in the beer that won a Gold Medal for the Indianapolis Brewery at the Paris Exposition of 1889 was coffee!\nTing-a-ling!\nThat still wasn\u2019t enough fun out there in Denver? OK, how about the fact that the name of the owner of the Wynkoop Brewing Company, a guy about Joe\u2019s age, was John Hickenlooper? So what? Only this: When I went to Cornell University to become a chemist fifty-six years ago, I was made a fraternity brother of a man named John Hickenlooper.\nTing-a-ling?\nThis was his son! My fraternity brother had died when this son was only seven. I knew more about him than his own son did! I was able to tell this young Denver brewer that his dad, in partnership with another Delta Upsilon brother, John Locke, sold candy and soft drinks and cigarettes out of a big closet at the top of the stairs on the second floor of the fraternity house.\nThey christened it Hickenlooper\u2019s Lockenbar.

Somewhere deep inside Boaz was worried sick. He was worried sick about losing his job. It had never been clear to him how he had landed the job\u2014the great privilege. He didn\u2019t even know who had given him the swell job.\nBoaz didn\u2019t even know who was in command of the real commanders.\nHe had never received an order\u2014not from anyone who was superior to the real commanders. Boaz based his actions, as did all the real commanders, on what could be best described as conversational tidbits\u2014tidbits circulated on the real-commander level.\nWhenever the real commanders got together late at night, the tidbits were passed around with the beer and the crackers and cheese.\nThere would be a tidbit, for instance, about waste in the supply rooms, and another about the desirability of soldiers\u2019 actually getting hurt and mad during jujitsu training, another about soldiers\u2019 shabby tendency to skip loops in lacing up their puttees. Boaz himself would pass these on, without any idea as to their point of origin\u2014 and he would base his actions on them.\nThe execution of Stony Stevenson by Unk had also been announced in this way. Suddenly, it had been the topic of conversation.\nSuddenly, the real commanders had placed Stony under arrest.\nBoaz now fingered the control box in his pocket, without actually touching a control. He took his place among the men he controlled, came to attention voluntarily, pressed a button, and relaxed as his squadmates relaxed.\nHe wanted a drink of hard liquor very much. And he was entitled to liquor, too, whenever he wanted it. Unlimited supplies of all kinds of liquor were flown in from Earth regularly for the real commanders. And the officers could have all the liquor they wanted, too, though they couldn\u2019t get the good stuff.

He had recovered the instrument from beside the body of Zenji. Both bodies had been moved out of sight\u2014into the burglarized souvenir shop. *Siegfried himself had covered them with souvenir bedspreads, which bore the same portrait of Charles Darwin which hung behind the bar.\nSo *Siegfried von Kleist shepherded Mary Hepburn and Hisako Hiroguchi and *James Wait and Selena MacIntosh and *Kazakh out to a gaily decorated bus parked in front of the hotel. This bus was to have carried musicians and dancers out to the airport\u2014to regale the celebrities from New York. The six Kanka-bono girls came right along with them, and I have put a star in front of the dog\u2019s name because she would soon be killed and eaten by those children. It was no time to be a dog.\nSelena wanted to know where her father was, and Hisako wanted to know where her husband was. *Siegfried said that they had gone ahead to the airport. His plan was to somehow get them on a plane, whether a commercial flight or a charter flight or a military flight, which would get them safely out of Ecuador. The truth about Andrew MacIntosh and Zenji Hiroguchi would be the last thing they heard from him before the plane took off\u2014at which time they might still survive, no matter how frenzied with grief they became.\nAs a sop to Mary, he agreed to take the six girls along. He could make no sense of their language, even with the help of Mandarax. The best Mandarax could do was to identify one word in twenty, maybe, as being closely related to Quechuan, the lingua franca of the Inca Empire. Here and there Mandarax thought it might have heard a little Arabic, too, the lingua franca of the African slave trade so long ago.\nNow, there is a big-brain idea I haven\u2019t heard much about lately: human slavery. How could you ever hold somebody in bondage with nothing but your flippers and your mouth?\n32\nJUST AS EVERYBODY got nicely settled in the bus in front of the El Dorado, the news came over several radios in the crowd that \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d had been canceled. That meant to the crowd, and to the soldiers, too, who were just civilians in soldier suits, that the food in the hotel now belonged to everyone.

That I can\u2019t see that necessity is probably yet another mark of my shallowness as a participant in a life of serious art.\nThese are just my painter friends who killed themselves, all with considerable artistic successes behind them or soon to come:\nArshile Gorky hanged himself in 1948. Jackson Pollock, while drunk, drove his car into a tree along a deserted road in 1956. That was right before my first wife and kids walked out on me. Three weeks later, Terry Kitchen shot himself through the roof of his mouth with a pistol.\nBack when we all lived in New York City, Pollock and Kitchen and I, heavy drinkers all, were known in the Cedar Tavern as the \u201cThree Musketeers.\u201d\nTrivia question: How many of the Three Musketeers are alive today?

It was as though I had died and gone to heaven! A waitress said to me, \u201cHoneybunch, you sit right down, and I\u2019ll bring you your coffee right away.\u201d I hadn\u2019t said anything to her.\nSo I did sit down, and everywhere I looked I saw customers of every description being received with love. To the waitress everybody was \u201choneybunch\u201d and \u201cdarling\u201d and \u201cdear.\u201d It was like an emergency ward after a great catastrophe. It did not matter what race or class the victims belonged to. They were all given the same miracle drug, which was coffee. The catastrophe in this case, of course, was that the sun had come up again.\nI thought to myself, \u201cMy goodness\u2014these waitresses and cooks are as unjudgmental as the birds and lizards on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, off Ecuador.\u201d I was able to make the comparison because I had read about those peaceful islands in prison, in a National Geographic loaned to me by the former lieutenant governor of Wyoming. The creatures there had had no enemies, natural or unnatural, for thousands of years. The idea of anybody\u2019s wanting to hurt them was inconceivable to them.\nSo a person coming ashore there could walk right up to an animal and unscrew its head, if he wanted to. The animal would have no plan for such an occasion. And all the other animals would simply stand around and watch, unable to draw any lessons for themselves from what was going on. A person could unscrew the head of every animal on an island, if that was his idea of business or fun.\nI had the feeling that if Frankenstein\u2019s monster crashed into the coffee shop through a brick wall, all anybody would say to him was, \u201cYou sit down here, Lambchop, and I\u2019ll bring you your coffee right away.\u201d\nThe profit motive was not operating. The transactions were on the order of sixty-eight cents, a dollar ten, two dollars and sixty-three \u2026 I would find out later that the man who ran the cash register was the owner, but he would not stay at his post to rake the money in. He wanted to cook and wait on people, too, so that the waitresses and cooks kept having to say to him, \u201cThat\u2019s my customer, Frank. Get back to the cash register,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m the cook here, Frank. What\u2019s this mess you\u2019ve started here? Get back to the cash register,\u201d and so on.\nHis full name was Frank Ubriaco. He is now executive vice-president of the McDonald\u2019s Hamburgers Division of The RAMJAC Corporation.\nI could not help noticing that he had a withered right hand. It looked as though it had been mummified, although he could still use his fingers some. I asked my waitress about it. She said he had literally French-fried that hand about a year ago. He accidentally dropped his wristwatch into a vat of boiling cooking oil. Before he realized what he was doing, he had plunged his hand into the oil, trying to rescue the watch, which was a very expensive Bulova Accutron.\nSo out into the city I went again, feeling much improved.\nI sat down to read my newspaper in Bryant Park, behind the Public Library at Forty-second Street.

He was illiterate, but legendary among Tarkingtonians, and no doubt back home, too, for his phenomenal memory. Like the father of the founder of the college, his ancestor, he could learn by heart anything that was read out loud to him 3 times or so. I knew several convicts at Athena, also illiterate, who could do that, too.\nHe wanted to quote Shakespeare now. \u201cI want it on the record,\u201d he said, \u201cthat this has been an extremely painful episode for me as well.\u201d And then he delivered this speech from Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet, in which the dying Mercutio, Romeo\u2019s gallant and witty best friend, describes the wound he received in a duel:\n\u201cNo, \u2018tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door; but \u2019tis enough, \u2019twill serve: ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague on both your houses!\u201d\nThe two houses, of course, were the Montagues and the Capulets, the feuding families of Romeo and Juliet, whose nitwit hatred would indirectly cause Mercutio\u2019s departure for Paradise.\nI HAVE LIFTED this speech from Bartlett\u2019s Familiar Quotations. If more people would acknowledge that they got their pearls of wisdom from that book instead of the original, it might clear the air.\nIF THERE REALLY had been a Mercutio, and if there really were a Paradise, Mercutio might be hanging out with teenage Vietnam draftee casualties now, talking about what it felt like to die for other people\u2019s vanity and foolishness.\n19\nWHEN I HEARD a few months later, after I had gone to work at Athena, that Robert Moellenkamp had been wiped out and then some by Microsecond Arbitrage, and had had to sell his boats and his horses and his El Greco and all that, I assumed he quit the Board. Tarkington\u2019s Trustees were expected to give a lot of money to the college every year. Otherwise why would Lowell Chung\u2019s mother, who had to have everything that was said at meetings translated into Chinese, have been tolerated as a member of the Board?\nActually, I don\u2019t think Mrs. Chung would have become a member if another Trustee, a Caucasian Tarkington classmate of Moellenkamp\u2019s, John W. Fedders, Jr., hadn\u2019t grown up in Hong Kong, and so could serve as her interpreter. His father was an importer of ivory and rhinoceros horns, which many Orientals believed to be aphrodisiacs. He also traded, it was suspected, in industrial quantities of opium. Fedders was perhaps the most conceited man I ever saw out of uniform. He thought his fluency in Chinese made him as brilliant as a nuclear physicist, as though 1,000,000,000 other people, including, no doubt, 1,000,000 morons, couldn\u2019t speak Chinese.", 0.18000000000000002], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["eddie", 0.17719035954811171], ["prague", 0.13371750167734409], ["buzzer", 0.1311438023827929], ["banquet", 0.1168708883406272], ["russians", 0.1030079447294283], ["tags", 0.094898642567265], ["german", 0.0903099321892543], ["blond", 0.07528205750703049], ["shady", 0.0584354441703136], ["gettin", 0.0584354441703136], ["stumbled", 0.0584354441703136], ["fuzzier", 0.0584354441703136], ["sneakin", 0.0584354441703136], ["killing", 0.0584354441703136], ["abuse", 0.0584354441703136], ["path", 0.0584354441703136], ["relish", 0.0584354441703136], ["released", 0.0584354441703136], ["wrench", 0.0584354441703136], ["em", 0.056956242869547376], ["stream", 0.05150397236471415], ["dipped", 0.05150397236471415], ["senses", 0.05150397236471415], ["anxiously", 0.05150397236471415], ["booze", 0.05150397236471415], ["hurled", 0.05150397236471415], ["hell", 0.04819114425092427], ["geography", 0.0474493212836325], ["headed", 0.0474493212836325], ["swore", 0.0474493212836325], ["collar", 0.0474493212836325], ["slammed", 0.04457250055911469], ["string", 0.04457250055911469], ["tanks", 0.04457250055911469], ["motor", 0.0423410650459726], ["carefully", 0.0423410650459726], ["direction", 0.0423410650459726], ["kill", 0.040517849478033045], ["spot", 0.03897634267976047], ["scared", 0.03764102875351524], ["guys", 0.03764102875351524], ["ride", 0.03764102875351524], ["americans", 0.03764102875351524], ["listening", 0.036463198396951405], ["older", 0.036463198396951405], ["growing", 0.036463198396951405], ["sit", 0.03540959324037314], ["boys", 0.03540959324037314], ["ain", 0.033586377672433596], ["catch", 0.033586377672433596], ["bet", 0.033586377672433596], ["dog", 0.03204487087416101], ["death", 0.03204487087416101], ["mess", 0.03204487087416101], ["finger", 0.03204487087416101], ["big", 0.031617290799800885], ["spoke", 0.0313549421592915], ["caught", 0.0313549421592915], ["yeah", 0.0313549421592915], ["road", 0.0313549421592915], ["foot", 0.030709556947915786], ["wonderful", 0.030103310729751438], ["tired", 0.02953172659135195], ["fell", 0.02953172659135195], ["today", 0.028991054378649194], ["man", 0.028595858664288175], ["started", 0.027990219793079366], ["idea", 0.027525019636730437], ["inside", 0.027525019636730437], ["side", 0.025477075510270307], ["brought", 0.02511339906856156], ["wait", 0.02511339906856156], ["car", 0.02205958257304974], ["find", 0.021799827709017134], ["long", 0.01951724118920733], ["door", 0.019315214116032136], ["turned", 0.018545603704670854], ["young", 0.018545603704670854], ["looked", 0.014490952623589211]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThe Russians,\u201d said the young German, seeming to relish the idea. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill you, too, if they catch you.

I only found out about it day before yesterday. I was reading a magazine, and I also had the television on. A group of scientists was on television, saying that the theory of floating, crashing, grinding slabs was more than a theory. They could prove it was true now, and that Japan and San Francisco, for instance, were in hideous danger, because that was where some of the most violent crashing and grinding was going on.\nThey said, too, that ice ages would continue to occur. Mile-thick glaciers would, geologically speaking, continue to go down and up like window blinds.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDwayne Hoover, incidentally, had an unusually large penis, and didn\u2019t even know it.

There was a knife, all right, but there was also a pistol, not much bigger than my fist, and a full clip beside it. I played with it, figured out how it worked, and shoved the clip into place to see if it really belonged with the gun. It was a pretty thing\u2014a nice souvenir.
