"sentiment": ["The cast party afterward was a clambake on the beach at Xanadu. As in the last scene of 8\u00bd, the motion picture by Federico Fellini, tout le monde was there, if not in person, then represented by look-alikes. Monica Pepper resembled my sister Allie. The bakemaster, a local man who is paid to stage such parties in the summertime, resembled my late publisher Seymour Lawrence (1926\u20141993), who rescued me from certain oblivion, from smithereens, by publishing Slaughterhouse-Five, and then bringing all my previous books back into print under his umbrella.\nKilgore Trout looked like my father.\nThe only sound effect Trout had to create backstage was in the last moments of the last scene of the last act of the play, of what Trout himself called \u201ca manmade timequake.\u201d He was equipped with an antique steam whistle from the heyday of Indian Head Mills. A plumber, who was a club member and looked a lot like my brother, put the gaily mournful whistle atop a tank of compressed air, with a valve in between. That is what Trout was, too, in all he wrote: gaily mournful.\nThere were of course many club members who had no parts in Abe Lincoln in Illinois, who would have liked at least to blow that big brass rooster, once they saw it and then heard it blown by the plumber himself during dress rehearsal. But the club most of all wanted Trout to feel that he was home at last, and a vital member of an extended family.\nNot merely the club and the household staff at Xanadu, and the chapters of Alcoholics Anonymous and Gamblers Anonymous, which met in the ballroom there, and the battered women and children and grandparents who had found shelter there, were grateful for his healing and encouraging mantra, which made bad times a coma: You were sick, but now you\u2019re well again, and there\u2019s work to do. The whole world was.\n61\nIn order that Trout not miss his cue to blow the whistle, which he was terrified of doing, of spoiling everything for his family, the plumber who looked like my brother stood behind him and the apparatus, his hands on Trout\u2019s old shoulders. He would squeeze those shoulders gently when it was time for Trout\u2019s debut in show biz.\nThe last scene in the play is set in the yards of the railroad station at Springfield, Illinois. The date is February 11th, 1861. Abraham Lincoln, in this instance played by the half-African-American great-great-grandson of John Wilkes Booth, having just been elected President of the United States in its darkest hour, is about to depart his hometown by railroad, for Washington, God help him, District of Columbia.\nHe says, as indeed Lincoln said: \u201cNo one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feelings of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of you people, I owe everything. I have lived here a quarter of a century, and passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born and one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when or whether ever I may return.\n\u201cI am called upon to assume the Presidency at a time when eleven of our sovereign states have announced their intention to secede from the Union, when threats of war increase in fierceness from day to day.", 0.044270833333333336], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["ying", 0.10182864776787912], ["pi",

Pi Ying\u2019s soldiers converged, hammered him to the floor and dragged him back to his square.\nIn the midst of the bedlam, Jerry burst into tears and raced terrified to his father and mother. Kelly freed Margaret, who dropped to her knees to hug the quaking child. Paul, Jerry\u2019s twin, held his ground, trembled, stared stolidly at the floor.\n\"Shall we get on with the game, Colonel?\" asked Pi Ying, his voice high. Barzov turned his back to the board, unwilling to prevent the next step, apparently reluctant to watch it.\nKelly closed his eyes, and waited for Pi Ying to give the order to the executioners. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to look at Margaret and Jerry. Pi Ying waved his hand for silence. \"It is with deep regret\u2014\" he began. His lips closed. The menace suddenly went out of his face, leaving only surprise and stupidity. The small man slumped on the balustrade, slithered over it to crash among his soldiers.\nMajor Barzov struggled with the Chinese girl. In her small hand, still free of his grasp, was a slender knife. She drove it into her breast and fell against the major. Barzov let her fall. He strode to the balustrade. \"Keep the prisoners where they are!\" he shouted at the guards. \"Is he alive?\" There was no anger in his voice, no sorrow\u2014only irritation, resentment of inconvenience. A servant looked up and shook his head.\nBarzov ordered servants and soldiers to carry out the bodies of Pi Ying and the girl. It was more the act of a scrupulous housekeeper than a pious mourner. No one questioned his brisk authority.\n\"So this is your party after all,\" said Kelly.\n\"The peoples of Asia have lost a very great leader,\" Barzov said severely. He smiled at Kelly oddly. \"Though he wasn\u2019t without weaknesses, was he, Colonel?\" He shrugged. \"However, you\u2019ve won only the initiative, not the game; and now you have me to reckon with instead of Pi Ying. Stay where you are, Colonel. I\u2019ll be back shortly.\"\nHe ground out his cigarette on the ornamented balustrade, returned the holder to his pocket with a flourish, and disappeared through the curtains.\n\"Is Jerry going to be all right?\" whispered Margaret.

He didn\u2019t care much if I died, either, or Felix or his mother\u2014or the pilot, who had gone to high school with my brother, and who was scared stiff. If we had an engine failure before we reached Cincinnati, the nearest open runway, where could we land?\nBut the satisfaction Mr. Barry found in the company of his mother and in their harum-scarum visits to athletic and cultural events all over the world was anything but proof of neutrality. If he liked any part of life that much, he couldn\u2019t march in the great parade of neuters in the sweet by-and-by.\nOr his mother, either.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFred and his mother really had liked Katmandu, and they had stayed up late afterwards, so they could get early editions of the morning newspapers and read the reviews.

The rest of the guards had, before the raid began, gone to the comforts of their own homes in Dresden.

She would say later that she thought she was the only person in the garden of Eden, and then she came upon this creature in a sailor suit who was acting as though he already owned everything. And Roy would counter that she was the one, in fact, who acted as though she owned everything.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she said.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think people were supposed to sleep in this part of the park,\u201d he said. He was right about that, and Mary knew it. She and her friend were in violation of the rules of the living museum. They were in an area where only lower animals were supposed to be at night.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sailor?\u201d she said.\nAnd he said that, yes, he was\u2014or had been until very recently. He had just been discharged from the Navy, and was hitchhiking around the country before going home, and found people were much more inclined to pick him up if he wore his uniform.\nIt would make no sense today for somebody to ask, as Mary asked Roy, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The reasons for being anywhere today are so invariably simple and obvious. Nobody has a tale as tangled as Roy\u2019s to tell: that he took his discharge in San Francisco, and cashed in his ticket, and bought a sleeping bag and hitchhiked to the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park and some other places he had always wanted to see. He was especially fascinated by birds, and could talk to them in their own languages.\nSo he heard on a car radio that a pair of ivory-billed woodpeckers, a species believed to have been long extinct, had been sighted in this little state park in Indiana. He headed straight for there. The story would turn out to be a hoax. These big, beautiful inhabitants of primeval forests really were extinct, since human beings had destroyed all their natural habitats. No longer was there enough rotten wood and peace and quiet for them.\n\u201cThey needed lots of peace and quiet,\u201d said Roy, \u201cand so do I, and so do you, I guess, and I\u2019m sorry if I disturbed you. I wasn\u2019t doing anything a bird wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d\nSome automatic device clicked in her big brain, and her knees felt weak, and there was a chilly feeling in her stomach.

I didn\u2019t have any, but I hoped Mrs. Berman might have some. I had heard her come up the stairs very slowly and go into her bedroom.\nHer door was wide open, so I paid her a call. She was sitting on the edge of her bed, staring straight ahead. I asked her for a sleeping pill, and she told me to help myself in the bathroom. I hadn\u2019t entered that bathroom since she took up residence. In fact, I don\u2019t think I had been in it for years and years. There is a good chance that I had never been in that bathroom before.\nAnd, my God\u2014I wish you could see the pills she had! They were apparently samples from drug salesmen which her late doctor husband had accumulated over decades! The medicine cabinet couldn\u2019t begin to hold them all! The marble counter-top around the washbasin was about five feet long and two feet wide, I would estimate, and an entire regiment of little bottles was deployed there. The scales dropped from my eyes! So much was suddenly explicable\u2014the strange salutation when we first met on the beach, the impulsive redecoration of the foyer, the unbeatable pool game, the dancing madness, and on and on.\nAnd which patient needed me most now in the dead of night?\nWell\u2014what could I do for a pill freak that she couldn\u2019t do better or worse for herself? So I went back to Slazinger empty handed, and we talked about his trip to Poland for a while. Why not? Any port in a storm.\nHere is the solution to the American drug problem suggested a couple of years back by the wife of our President: \u201cJust say no.\u201d\nMaybe Mrs. Berman could say no to her pills, but poor Paul Slazinger had no control over the dangerous substances his own body was manufacturing and dumping in his bloodstream. He had no choice but to think all kinds of crazy things. And I listened to him rave on awhile about how well he could write, if only he were in hiding or in prison in Poland, and how the Polly Madison Books were the greatest works of literature since Don Quixote.\nHe did get off one pretty good crack about her, but I don\u2019t think it was meant to be a crack, since he was so rapt when he said it. He called her \u201cthe Homer of the bubblegum crowd.\u201d\nAnd let\u2019s just get it out of the way right here and now about the merits of the Polly Madison books. To settle this question in my own mind, without having to actually read them, I have just solicited by telephone the opinions of a bookseller and a librarian in East Hampton, and also the widows of a couple of the old Abstract Expressionist gang who have teenage grandchildren now.\nThey all said about the same thing, boiling down to this: \u201cUseful, frank, and intelligent, but as literature hardly more than workmanlike.\u201d", 0.09426700036075036], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["spring", 0.09699695856135039], ["seasons", 0.06661696680353021], ["ears",

say, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not a young person these days.\u2019 All I can say is, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not a young person these days.\u2019\n\u201cPresident Beal wished to exclude all negative thinking from his own farewell to you, and so has asked me to make this announcement: \u2019All persons who still owe parking fees are to pay up before leaving the property, or there will be unpleasant monkey business with their transcripts.\u2019\n\u201cWhen I was a boy in Indianapolis, there was a humorist there named Kin Hubbard. He wrote a few lines for The Indianapolis News every day. Indianapolis needs all the humorists it can get. He was often as witty as Oscar Wilde. He said, for instance, that Prohibition was better than no liquor at all. He said that whoever named near-beer was a poor judge of distance. He said that it was no disgrace to be poor, but that it might as well be. He went to a graduation ceremony one time, and he said afterward that he thought it would be better if all the really important stuff was spread out over four years instead of being saved up for the very end.\n\u201cWell\u2014I assume that the really important stuff has been spread out over the years here at Fredonia, and that you have no need of anything much from me. This is lucky for me. I have only this to say, basically: This is the end\u2014this is childhood\u2019s end for certain. \u2019Sorry about that,\u2019 as they used to say in the Vietnam War.\n\u201cPerhaps you have read the novel Childhood\u2019s End by Arthur C. Clarke, one of the few masterpieces in the field of science fiction. All of the others were written by me. In Clark\u2019s novel, mankind suddenly undergoes a spectacular evolutionary change. The children become very different from the parents, less physical, more spiritual\u2014and one day they form up into a sort of column of light which spirals out into the universe, its mission unknown. The book ends there. You seniors, however, look a great deal like your parents, and I doubt that you will go radiantly into space as soon as you have your diplomas in hand. It is far more likely that you will go to Buffalo or Rochester or East Quogue\u2014or Cohoes.\n\u201cAnd I suppose you will all want money and true love, among other things. I will tell you how to make money: Work very hard. I will tell you how to win love: Wear nice clothing and smile all the time. Learn the words to all the latest songs.\n\u201cWhat other advice can I give you? Eat lots of bran to provide necessary bulk in your diet. The only advice my father ever gave me was this: \u2019Never stick anything in your ear.\u2019 The tiniest bones in your body are inside your ears, you know\u2014and your sense of balance, too. If you mess around with your ears, you could not only become deaf, but you could also start falling down all the time. So just leave your ears completely alone. They\u2019re fine, just the way they are.\n\u201cDon\u2019t murder anybody\u2014even though New York State does not put people in the electric chair anymore.\n\u201cThat\u2019s about it.\n\u201cOne sort of optional thing you might do is to realize that there are six seasons instead of four. The poetry of four seasons is all wrong for this part of the planet, and this may explain why we are so depressed so much of the time. I mean, spring doesn\u2019t feel like spring a lot of the time, and November is all wrong for autumn, and so on. Here is the truth about the seasons: Spring is May and June. What could be springier than May and June? Summer is July and August. Really hot, right? Autumn is September and October. See the pumpkins? Smell those burning leaves?

He didn\u2019t think it was an Indian, which was my first guess. He said it had belonged to a white woman maybe 20 years old.

He judged from the patina on the skull that its owner had died long before we were born. He was here to examine the bodies of people who had been killed after the prison break, and to make educated guesses about how they had died, by gunshot or whatever.\nHe was especially fascinated by Tex Johnson\u2019s body. He had seen almost everything in his line of work, he told me, but never a man who had been crucified, with spikes through the palms and feet and all.\nI WANTED HIM to talk more about the skull, but he changed the subject right back to crucifixion.
