in question was whether I would be along to see what happened next. The price I would have to pay for satisfying my curiosity about the destinies of the people on the ship was unambiguous: to continue to haunt the earth, without a chance of parole, for a million years.\nThe decision was made for me by Mary Hepburn, by \u201cMrs. Flemming,\u201d whose joy in the crow\u2019s nest held my attention so long that when I looked back at the tunnel, the tunnel was gone.\nI have now completed that sentence of one thousand millennia. I have paid in full my debt to society or whatever. I can expect to see the blue tunnel again at any time. I will of course skip into its mouth most gladly. Nothing ever happens around here anymore that I haven\u2019t seen or heard so many times before. Nobody, surely, is going to write Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony\u2014or tell a lie, or start a Third World War.\nMother was right: Even in the darkest times, there really was still hope for humankind.\nOn the afternoon of Monday, December 1, 1986, Captain Adolf von Kleist, whose ship was without a utile anchor, intentionally ran the Bah\u00eda de Darwin aground on a lava shoal which was close to shore. He believed that she could drag herself free, as she had done in Guayaquil, when it was time to sail again.\nWhen did he plan to sail again? As soon as the larders were stocked with eggs and boobies and iguanas and penguins and cormorants and crabs, and anything else that was edible and easy to catch. When he had a food supply to match his stores of fuel and water, he could return at leisure to the mainland, and seek a peaceful port which would take them in. He would rediscover the South American continent.\nHe switched off his faithful engines. That would be the end of their faithfulness. For reasons he was never able to determine, they would never start again.\nThis meant that the stoves and ovens and refrigerators would soon be out of business, too\u2014as soon as the batteries ran down.\nThere were still ten meters of stern line, of white nylon umbilical cord, coiled by a cleat on the main deck. The Captain tied knots in this, and then he and Mary climbed down it to the shoal, and waded ashore to gather eggs and kill lower animals who had no fear of them. They would use Mary\u2019s blouse and James Wait\u2019s new shirt, which still had the price tag on it, for grocery bags.\nThey wrung the necks of boobies. They caught land iguanas by their tails, and beat them to death on black boulders. And it was during this carnage that Mary would scratch herself, and a fearless vampire finch would take its first sip of human blood.", 0.1687689704931084], "title": "Galapagos"},

And the fact that the man is a mental patient wouldn't interfere with his game, would it?\" He didn't wait for an answer. \"And then when Eliot came bounding off the court, victorious, to shake our hands, I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. 'And this is the man,' I said to myself, 'who has to prove tomorrow that he's not insane! Ha!' \"\nEliot, drawing courage from the fact that the four men watching him were sure he was sane, now stood, as though to stretch. His real purpose was to bring himself nearer the birdbath. He took advantage of his reputation as an athlete, hopped into the dry pool, did a deep-knee bend, as though working off an excess of animal spirits. His body did the exercise effortlessly. He was made of spring steel.\nThe vigorous movements called Eliot's attention to something bulky in his hip pocket. He pulled it out, found that it was a rolled copy of The American Investigator. He unrolled it, half expecting to see Randy Herald begging to be planted with genius seeds. What he saw on the cover was his own picture instead. He was wearing a fire helmet. The picture was a blow-up from a Fourth of July group photograph of the Fire Department.\nThe headline said this:\nSANEST MAN IN AMERICA? (SEE INSIDE)\nEliot looked inside, while the others engaged each other in optimistic palaver about the way the hearing would go next day. Eliot found another picture of himself in the center spread. It was a blurry one of him playing tennis on the nut house court.\nOn the facing page, the gallantly sore-headed little family of Fred Rosewater seemed to glare at him as he played. They looked like sharecroppers. Fred had lost a lot of weight, too. There was a picture of Norman Mushari, their lawyer. Mushari, now in business for himself, had acquired a fancy vest and massive gold watch chain. He was quoted as follows:\n\"My clients want nothing but their natural and legal birthrights for themselves and their descendents. The bloated Indiana plutocrats have spent millions and mobilized powerful friends from coast to coast in order to deny their cousins their day in court. The hearing has been delayed seven times for the flimsiest of reasons, and, meanwhile, within the walls of a lunatic asylum, Eliot Rosewater plays and plays, and his henchmen deny loudly that he is insane.\n\"If my clients lose this case, they will lose their modest house and average furnishings, their used car, their child's small sailboat, Fred Rosewater's insurance policies, their life savings, and thousands borrowed from a loyal friend. These brave, wholesome, average Americans have bet everything they have on the American system of justice, which will not, must not, cannot let them down.\"\nOn Eliot's side of the layout were two pictures of Sylvia.

One item was about the approximately seven thousand American citizens living in Italy. The American Embassy, which was still operating, still technically at peace with Italy, announced that it was making plans to provide transportation back to the United States for as many as possible, as soon as possible. The Italian government responded that it would do all within its power to facilitate their departure, but that there was surely no reason for a mass exodus, since Italy and the United States had close bonds of both blood and history which should not be broken in order to satisfy the demands of Jews and Communists and the decaying British Empire.\nMarilee\u2019s personal maid came in with the quotidian announcement that some sort of workman wanted to talk to her about the possibility of old, leaking gas pipes in her bedroom, and he wore coveralls and had a toolbox. He tapped the walls and sniffed, and murmured to himself in Italian. And then, when the two of them were surely alone, he began, still facing the wall, to speak softly in middle-western American English.\nHe said that he was from the War Department of the United States, which is what the Department of Defense used to be called. We had no separate spy organization back then. He said that he had no idea how she felt down deep about democracy or fascism, but that it was his duty to ask her, for the good of their country, to remain in Italy and to continue to curry the favor of Mussolini\u2019s government.\nBy her own account, Marilee then thought about democracy and fascism for the first time in her life. She decided that democracy sounded better.\n\u201cWhy should I stay here and do that?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cSooner or later, you might hear something we would be very interested in knowing,\u201d he said. \u201cSooner or later, or even possibly never, your country might have some use to make of you.\u201d\nShe said to him that the whole world suddenly seemed to be going crazy.\nHe commented that there was nothing sudden about it, that it had belonged in a prison or a lunatic asylum for quite some time.\nAs an example of what she saw as sudden craziness, she told him about Mussolini\u2019s ordering his minister of culture to marry her.\nHe replied, according to Marilee: \u201cIf you have one atom of love for America in your heart, you will marry him.\u201d", 0.06859567901234569], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["mirrors", 0.17722609631507757], ["shiver", 0.1464347475611235], ["weems", 0.13789902253453962], ["foltz", 0.10781475249736094], ["gentlemen", 0.08584040300864862], ["carney", 0.08333224038221902], ["hunchback", 0.07321737378056176], ["gratified", 0.07321737378056176], ["flights", 0.07321737378056176], ["bundled", 0.07321737378056176], ["explains", 0.07321737378056176], ["remain", 0.07321737378056176], ["violently", 0.0640970161416151], ["pole", 0.0640970161416151], ["clapped", 0.0640970161416151], ["chose", 0.0640970161416151], ["bundle", 0.0640970161416151], ["north", 0.0640970161416151], ["ladies", 0.058761948929665575], ["lightly", 0.058761948929665575], ["uncomfortable", 0.058761948929665575], ["unhappy", 0.058761948929665575], ["ached", 0.058761948929665575], ["continued", 0.058761948929665575], ["bitter", 0.058761948929665575], ["warned", 0.058761948929665575], ["side", 0.057821699403584725], ["elevator", 0.05497665850266845], ["guests", 0.05497665850266845], ["shoulders", 0.05497665850266845], ["better", 0.05213161760175219], ["struck", 0.04964159129071892], ["closely", 0.04964159129071892], ["stairs", 0.04964159129071892], ["climb", 0.04964159129071892], ["weren", 0.04761329287193921], ["ballroom", 0.04761329287193921], ["cold", 0.044306524078769394], ["lives", 0.044306524078769394], ["neck", 0.044306524078769394], ["passed", 0.04292020150432431], ["watched", 0.04052123365177227], ["hall", 0.04052123365177227], ["began", 0.037585134292374776], ["case", 0.037585134292374776], ["going", 0.03658245098492253], ["open", 0.035186166439822746], ["afraid", 0.035186166439822746], ["moment", 0.034474755633634904], ["top", 0.03379984386537766], ["held", 0.03379984386537766], ["dead", 0.03315786802104303], ["office", 0.03254576255216286], ["happened", 0.03140087601282563], ["police", 0.02803333161628352], ["hands", 0.025705295982611433], ["three", 0.025354397994688256], ["years", 0.025354397994688256], ["things", 0.02403751038209638], ["house", 0.023727898574067513], ["door", 0.021227324851858763], ["head", 0.01979049206284571]], "sentiment": ["Carney was a hunchback now, his neck, shoulders, and head ached so. \u201cI believe it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo that explains what happened to the ladies you\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Weems. \u201cThey\u2019re far from being dead, believe me.

That detail is missing today\u2014so this just might not be a dream after all. Who can say for certain?\n\u201cIn this dream, if it is a dream, it is the two-hundredth anniversary of the birth of William Ellery Channing, a principal founder of Unitarianism in the United States. I wish that I had been born into a society like his\u2014small and congenial and prosperous and self-sufficient. The people around here had ancestors in common then. They looked a lot like each other, dressed a lot like each other, enjoyed the same amusements and food. They were generally agreed as to what was good and what was evil\u2014what God was like, who Jesus was.\n\u201cChanning grew up in what the late anthropologist Robert Redfield called a folk society, a relatively isolated community of like-thinking friends and relatives, a stable extended family of considerable size. Redfield said that we were all descended from persons who lived in such societies, and that we were likely to hanker to live in one ourselves from time to time. A folk society, in his imagination and in our imaginations, too, is an ideal scheme within which people can take really good care of one another, can share fairly, and can distribute honors to one and all.\n\u201cMaybe so. That could also be a dream, but I do not choose to think so.\n\u201cChanning\u2019s folk society, with Harvard at its center, was quite possibly the most intelligent and creative folk society the Western Hemisphere has ever known. I have to say \u2019possibly,\u2019 since we know so little about the Incas and the Aztecs and the Mayans\u2014and some other tribes. I am tempted to include the Indianapolis of my grandfather\u2019s youth.\n\u201cBut Channing\u2019s folk society is gone now. It has been drowned by tidal waves of strangers from simply everywhere\u2014people like myself. Channing\u2019s folk society is now the American Atlantis, if you will.\n\u201cOne of the most durable American legends has to do with the last days of the drowning of that Atlantis. It is the story of the arrest and trial and execution of Sacco and Vanzetti\u2014of how the natives of Atlantis made war on the waves.\n\u201cThat war on the waves came much too late. It happened only day before yesterday, practically. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in Charlestown Prison in 1927. This part of New England had ceased to be a genuine folk society, had begun to admit strangers with unfamiliar ideas and customs in large numbers, one hundred years before that\u2014when William Ellery Channing was nearly fifty years old.\n\u201cChanning did not live long enough to see the truly towering waves of immigrants come crashing in. But he did see, in my opinion, that the narrow, ethnocentric sermons suitable to a folk society should not be preached here anymore. Sermons deeply rooted in local history and sociology and politics are by and large harmless, and perhaps even charming in a relatively closed and isolated community. Why shouldn\u2019t a preacher in such a society raise the morale of his parishioners by implying that they are better servants of God than strangers are? That is a very old type of sermon\u2014very old indeed. As old as the hills. Read the Old Testament. You can probably borrow a copy from the church next door.\n\u201cWhen Channing began preaching a new sort of sermon in this town, a sort of sermon we now perceive as Unitarian, he was urging his parishioners to credit with human dignity as great as their own persons not at all like their friends and relatives. The time to acknowledge the dignity of strangers, even black ones, had come.", 0.1297630702630703], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["donners", 0.1211027355014944], ["biography", 0.10552639436531586], ["donner", 0.10403887539850971], ["donahue", 0.09641481890221103], ["wagons", 0.08995005322913731], ["griot", 0.06935925026567315], ["liar", 0.0605513677507472], ["nevada", 0.0605513677507472], ["dealer", 0.0605513677507472], ["encyclopaedia", 0.0605513677507472], ["witness", 0.0605513677507472], ["homemade", 0.0605513677507472], ["sierra", 0.0605513677507472], ["statistically", 0.0605513677507472], ["mysterious", 0.0605513677507472], ["fishy", 0.0605513677507472], ["kidnapped", 0.0605513677507472], ["britannia", 0.0605513677507472], ["1846", 0.0605513677507472], ["britannica", 0.0605513677507472], ["fictitious", 0.0605513677507472], ["pathological", 0.0605513677507472], ["yelled", 0.0605513677507472], ["blizzard", 0.05276319718265793], ["handgrenade", 0.05276319718265793], ["mountains", 0.05276319718265793], ["fake", 0.05276319718265793], ["arm", 0.05276319718265793], ["details", 0.05276319718265793], ["federal", 0.05276319718265793], ["egyptian", 0.05276319718265793], ["protection", 0.05276319718265793], ["infamous", 0.05276319718265793], ["living", 0.048768447302208986], ["boy", 0.048768447302208986], ["unrelated", 0.048207409451105514], ["stole", 0.048207409451105514], ["sergeant", 0.048207409451105514], ["31", 0.048207409451105514], ["rule", 0.048207409451105514], ["switzerland", 0.048207409451105514], ["chicago", 0.04246779570092585], ["published", 0.04246779570092585], ["bike", 0.04041923888301625], ["arms", 0.04041923888301625], ["gathered", 0.04041923888301625], ["tarkingtonians", 0.03868720877259761], ["cross", 0.03868720877259761], ["program", 0.03868720877259761], ["california", 0.03868720877259761], ["subject", 0.03718685604647938], ["suppose", 0.03718685604647938], ["blown", 0.03586345115146383], ["written", 0.03586345115146383], ["party", 0.03586345115146383], ["caught", 0.034679625132836574], ["academy", 0.034679625132836574], ["18", 0.033608724236158766], ["claimed", 0.03263106831492697], ["kid", 0.03263106831492697], ["john", 0.03173171204893218], ["speaking", 0.03173171204893218], ["late", 0.030123837401284166], ["owned", 0.02871750995236275], ["lived", 0.028075280583374565], ["months", 0.027467783715169215], ["story", 0.02582055366806949], ["son", 0.023110867636419067], ["tv", 0.022335666833194892], ["looked", 0.02196724185765567], ["town", 0.021264765936517088], ["year", 0.01910328399665803], ["convicts", 0.017291282338274632], ["scipio", 0.014547496265105622], ["knew", 0.014179071289566397], ["wasn", 0.013141168816184204], ["1", 0.011599583181201228], ["vietnam", 0.011315113428568757], ["prison", 0.010633937902541397], ["time", 0.008259678423134579]], "sentiment": ["I even yelled 1 time at the prison, \u201cThere I am!

Statistically speaking, GRIOT\u2122 would have to put it into a biography every so often, I suppose, that the fictitious subject was on Donahue.\nHe claimed that the boy he lived with was his son.

I have known several Donners. One was a year behind me at the Academy. Two were unrelated Tarkingtonians. One was a First Sergeant in Vietnam who had his arm blown off by a little boy with a homemade handgrenade. Every one of those Donners knew the story of the infamous Donner Party, which got caught in a blizzard back in 1846 while trying to cross the Sierra Nevada Mountains in wagons to get to California. Their wagons were very likely made right here in Scipio.\nI have just looked up the details in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, published in Chicago and owned by a mysterious Egyptian arms dealer living in Switzerland.

Bob.\u201d\nO\u2019Hare had a little notebook with him, and printed in the back of it were postal rates and airline distances and the altitudes of famous mountains and other key facts about the world. He was looking up the population of Dresden, which wasn\u2019t in the notebook, when he came across this, which he gave me to read:\nOn an average, 324,000 new babies are born into the world every day. During that same day, 10,000 persons, on an average, will have starved to death or died from malnutrition. So it goes. In addition 123,000 persons will die for other reasons. So it goes. This leaves a net gain of about 191,000 each day in the world. The Population Reference Bureau predicts that the world\u2019s total population will double to 7,000,000,000 before the year 2000.\n\u201cI suppose they will all want dignity,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said O\u2019Hare.\nBilly Pilgrim was meanwhile traveling back to Dresden, too, but not in the present. He was going back there in 1945, two days after the city was destroyed. Now Billy and the rest were being marched into the ruins by their guards. I was there. O\u2019Hare was there. We had spent the past two nights in the blind inn-keeper\u2019s stable. Authorities had found us there. They told us what to do. We were to borrow picks and shovels and crowbars and wheelbarrows from our neighbors. We were to march with these implements to such and such a place in the ruins, ready to go to work.\nThere were barricades on the main roads leading into the ruins. Germans were stopped there. They were not permitted to explore the moon.\nPrisoners of war from many lands came together that morning at such and such a place in Dresden. It had been decreed that here was where the digging for bodies was to begin. So the digging began.\nBilly found himself paired as a digger with a Maori, who had been captured at Tobruk. The Maori was chocolate brown. He had whirlpools tattooed on his forehead and his cheeks. Billy and the Maori dug into the inert, unpromising gravel of the moon.

This is why I had gone to Midland City: to be born again. And Chaos announced that it was about to give birth to a new me by putting these words in the mouth of Rabo Karabekian: \u201cWhat kind of a man would turn his daughter into an outboard motor?\u201d\nSuch a small remark was able to have such thundering consequences because the spiritual matrix of the cocktail lounge was in what I choose to call a pre-earthquake condition. Terrific forces were at work on our souls, but they could do no work, because they balanced one another so nicely.\nBut then a grain of sand crumbled. One force had a sudden advantage over another, and spiritual continents began to shrug and heave.\nOne force, surely, was the lust for money which infested so many people in the cocktail lounge. They knew what Rabo Karabekian had been paid for his painting, and they wanted fifty thousand dollars, too. They could have a lot of fan with fifty thousand dollars, or so they believed. But they had to earn money the hard way, just a few dollars at a time, instead. It wasn\u2019t right.\nAnother force was the fear in these same people that their lives might be ridiculous, that their entire city might be ridiculous. Now the worst had happened: Mary Alice Miller, the one thing about their city which they had supposed was ridicule-proof had just been lazily ridiculed by a man from out-of-town.\nAnd my own pre-earthquake condition must be taken into consideration, too, since I was the one who was being reborn. Nobody else in the cocktail lounge was reborn, as far as I know. The rest got their minds changed, some of them, about the value of modern art.\nAs for myself: I had come to the conclusion that there was nothing sacred about myself or about any human being, that we were all machines, doomed to collide and collide and collide. For want of anything better to do, we became fans of collisions. Sometimes I wrote well about collisions, which meant I was a writing machine in good repair. Sometimes I wrote badly, which meant I was a writing machine in bad repair. I no more harbored sacredness than did a Pontiac, a mousetrap, or a South Bend Lathe.\nI did not expect Rabo Karabekian to rescue me. I had created him, and he was in my opinion a vain and weak and trashy man, no artist at all. But it is Rabo Karabekian who made me the serene Earthling which I am this day.\nListen:", 0.018249845392702545], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["savage", 0.2663233187010256], ["rich", 0.12938996696097962], ["manage", 0.11074668534037073], ["pronounces", 0.11074668534037073], ["seized", 0.11074668534037073], ["trailing", 0.11074668534037073], ["savages", 0.11074668534037073], ["insistent", 0.11074668534037073], ["flooded", 0.11074668534037073], ["wrist", 0.11074668534037073], ["bewitchingly", 0.11074668534037073], ["loses", 0.11074668534037073], ["incubator", 0.11074668534037073], ["caring", 0.09688374172917183], ["wickedly", 0.09688374172917183], ["senses", 0.09688374172917183], ["losing", 0.09688374172917183], ["sailing", 0.09688374172917183], ["yearning", 0.09688374172917183], ["wins", 0.09688374172917183], ["spelled", 0.08877443956700853], ["tennis", 0.08877443956700853], ["hoarsely", 0.08877443956700853], ["expense", 0.08302079811797292], ["meaning", 0.07855792709168873], ["love", 0.07598992429168604], ["pity", 0.07182848235926446], ["keeping", 0.07182848235926446], ["windows", 0.07182848235926446], ["wide", 0.06680219379364634], ["murmured", 0.06278877988440332], ["spoke", 0.06278877988440332], ["pisquontuit", 0.06104855234461073], ["blue", 0.06104855234461073], ["whispered", 0.05796553874806556], ["soul", 0.05796553874806556], ["baby", 0.05408241845924641], ["smile", 0.05293925018244744], ["lost", 0.05083203986929091], ["stopped", 0.04803680102178774], ["married", 0.04636916884300672], ["robert", 0.04340076874064125], ["voice", 0.036969096258092006], ["head", 0.03461343554496434], ["looked", 0.027569023673177293], ["life", 0.025776780499383554]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHe says you\u2019ve showed him the savage in himself,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any savage to begin with.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a pity,\u201d I said, \u201cafter they\u2019ve gone to so much expense keeping the savages out.
