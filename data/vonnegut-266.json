Things go badly for him. In effect, he has been busted from colonel to corporal. His response to the demotion has been an increase in bitterness in his reviews, and he will surely be busted again by and by. The publishers detest him.\nI\u2019ve met him only a couple of times, and we did not appear to like each other much. His pose has long been that he is not merely a reviewer, but one of the best writers of fiction around. And he did write some good stories years ago. And he has supposedly been working on an important novel for a long time. But his publisher, Sam Lawrence, is my publisher, too. And, about a year ago, Broyard introduced Sam to somebody as \u201c\u2026 my publisher.\u201d Sam was finally sick of that introduction, and he took Broyard aside, and demanded that Broyard return the advance on the novel\u2014a novel that clearly was never going to exist. Broyard returned the advance.\nThat\u2019s all I know.\nSam and I take off for Amsterdam next Saturday, about the time you get this letter, I expect. We really don\u2019t know each other very well. We will be blood brothers or enemies by October 13, when we finally arrive at the Book Fair in Frankfurt. We will have been to every Scandinavian capital, and Leningrad as well. I will be bringing my translator an enormous magnifying glass and a dictating machine.
