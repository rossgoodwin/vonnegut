when it was over, in a never-to-be-finished memoir entitled My Ten Years on Automatic Pilot: \u201cListen, if it isn\u2019t a timequake dragging us through knothole after knothole, it\u2019s something else just as mean and powerful.\u201d\n\u201cThis was a man,\u201d I said in Timequake One, \u201can only child, whose father, a college professor in Northampton, Massachusetts, murdered his mother when the man was only twelve years old.\u201d\nI said Trout had been a hobo, throwing away his stories instead of offering them to publications, since the autumn of 1975. I said that was after he received news of the death of his own only child, Leon, a deserter from the United States Marine Corps. Leon, I said, was accidentally decapitated in a shipyard accident in Sweden, where he had been granted political asylum and was working as a welder.\nI said Trout was fifty-nine when he hit the road, never to have a home again until he was given, when he was about to die, the Ernest Hemingway Suite at the Rhode Island writers\u2019 retreat called Xanadu.\nWhen Trout checked into the former Museum of the American Indian, a former reminder of the most extensive and persistent genocide known to history, \u201cThe Sisters B-36\u201d was burning a hole in his pocket, so to speak. He had finished the story at the Public Library downtown, but the police had taken him into custody before he could get rid of it.\nSo he kept his war-surplus Navy overcoat on when he told the clerk at the shelter that his name was Vincent van Gogh, and that he had no living relatives. Then he went outdoors again, and it was cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey out there, and he put the manuscript into the lidless wire trash receptacle, which was chained and padlocked to a fire hydrant in front of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\nWhen he got back into the shelter, after an absence of ten minutes, the clerk said to him, \u201cWhere have you been? We all sure missed you, Vince.\u201d And he told him where his cot was. It was butted up against the companion wall between the shelter and the Academy.\nOn the Academy side of the wall, hanging over the rosewood desk of Monica Pepper, was a painting of a bleached cow\u2019s skull on a desert floor, by Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. On Trout\u2019s side, right over the head of his cot, was a poster telling him never to stick his ding-dong into anything without first putting on a condom.\nAfter the timequake hit, and then the rerun was finally over, and free will had kicked in again, Trout and Monica would get to know each other.

I was tall for any age, since the general population is well under six feet tall, and I was six feet tall. I suppose my pituitary gland was out of kilter for a little while, and then it straightened itself out. I did not become a freakish adult, except for my record as a double murderer, as other people my age more or less caught up with me.\nBut I was abnormally tall and weak for a time there.

I\u2019ve checked every nook and cranny.\u201d\nHaley was not at all dismayed by the menace of Mr. Banghart. For one thing, he felt a personal immunity to that threat, since Mr. Banghart avowedly considered him one of his few friends in all humanity. For another, he was confident that the General would blow the poor devil to bits if he dared appear. But certainly most distracting was the exotic mixture of despondency and elation that simmered in his young soul. He was despondent over his smashed dreams of a musical career, but elation was born of Hope\u2019s subtle but unmistakably affectionate mien. He found himself in the emotional dilemma of a hurt child who has been presented with an ice-cream cone.\nHe was realist enough to know that the ice-cream cone was a small one, but hungry enough to make a great deal of it in his fancy. Honing his scythe in the cool dampness of the tool shed, he savored again the moments when Hope had seemed to look at him warmly. His expedition to Chicago had made him more of a man in her melodrama-loving eyes, he thought. If he had made a mess of his flight, it had at least been an adventuresome mess, not in a boy\u2019s world but in a man\u2019s. With the clean music of the blade against the stone mingling with his thoughts, Haley promised himself that he was indeed man enough to win the love of Hope.", 0.18098039215686273], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["pick", 0.04301966422222122], ["sanctuary", 0.03296681030218409], ["adoration", 0.03296681030218409], ["peering", 0.03296681030218409], ["unpleasant", 0.03296681030218409], ["platitudes", 0.03296681030218409], ["skeins", 0.03296681030218409], ["slouched", 0.03296681030218409], ["consciously", 0.03296681030218409], ["slick", 0.03296681030218409], ["shone", 0.03296681030218409], ["shred", 0.03296681030218409], ["rang", 0.03296681030218409], ["marked", 0.03296681030218409], ["resentment", 0.03296681030218409], ["cloud", 0.03296681030218409], ["checker", 0.03296681030218409], ["noting", 0.03296681030218409], ["cleanse", 0.03296681030218409], ["worn", 0.03296681030218409], ["overlooked", 0.03296681030218409], ["cavern", 0.03296681030218409], ["urge", 0.03296681030218409], ["lids", 0.03296681030218409], ["checkerboard", 0.03296681030218409], ["jumbled", 0.03296681030218409], ["felt", 0.02961585899550504], ["feet", 0.027874362868929404], ["consider", 0.027238321206647348], ["senseless", 0.027238321206647348], ["listening", 0.027238321206647348], ["fringes", 0.027238321206647348], ["square", 0.027238321206647348], ["swept", 0.027238321206647348], ["wire", 0.027238321206647348], ["checkers", 0.027238321206647348], ["risen", 0.027238321206647348], ["footsteps", 0.027238321206647348], ["folded", 0.027238321206647348], ["solemnly", 0.027238321206647348], ["cloth", 0.027238321206647348], ["cruel", 0.027238321206647348], ["viii", 0.027238321206647348], ["pale", 0.027238321206647348], ["parlor", 0.027238321206647348], ["planks", 0.027238321206647348], ["hall", 0.023887369899968303], ["farmhouse", 0.023887369899968303], ["jumped", 0.023887369899968303], ["shut", 0.023887369899968303], ["narrow", 0.023887369899968303], ["nearby", 0.023887369899968303], ["overhead", 0.023887369899968303], ["baby", 0.023887369899968303], ["stacked", 0.023887369899968303], ["tied", 0.023887369899968303], ["rested", 0.023887369899968303], ["complained", 0.023887369899968303], ["lose", 0.023887369899968303], ["window", 0.022312838296677948], ["hay", 0.02150983211111061], ["weeks", 0.02150983211111061], ["cool", 0.02150983211111061], ["objected", 0.02150983211111061], ["gathered", 0.02150983211111061], ["heavy", 0.02150983211111061], ["threw", 0.02150983211111061], ["moved", 0.02150983211111061], ["walk", 0.02150983211111061], ["earth", 0.019665670530001438], ["ears", 0.019665670530001438], ["knees", 0.019665670530001438], ["moon", 0.019665670530001438], ["carried", 0.019665670530001438], ["empty", 0.019665670530001438], ["corridor", 0.019665670530001438], ["marched", 0.019665670530001438], ["leave", 0.01815888080443157], ["darkness", 0.01815888080443157], ["bale", 0.01815888080443157], ["arms", 0.01815888080443157], ["slowly", 0.01815888080443157], ["white", 0.01815888080443157], ["piece", 0.01815888080443157], ["barnyard", 0.016884908243875712], ["beneath", 0.016884908243875712], ["men", 0.016884908243875712], ["silence", 0.016884908243875712], ["closed", 0.015781343015573872], ["loft", 0.015781343015573872], ["floor", 0.015781343015573872], ["ladder", 0.015781343015573872], ["moving", 0.015781343015573872], ["sound", 0.01480792949775252], ["bales", 0.013937181434464702], ["feel", 0.013937181434464702], ["started", 0.013149493998065321], ["hard", 0.012430391708894829], ["left", 0.012430391708894829], ["small", 0.0117688817281218], ["will", 0.0117688817281218], ["stood", 0.0117688817281218], ["light", 0.011156419148338974], ["barn", 0.010586230127785656], ["kitchen", 0.010052853920037134], ["sunroom", 0.010052853920037134], ["sat", 0.010052853920037134], ["night", 0.009551823987669903], ["hand", 0.009079440402215784], ["turned", 0.007421004902528583], ["asked", 0.00705363496392665], ["head", 0.00705363496392665], ["eyes", 0.006040392632585061], ["hope", 0.00376502365075557], ["haley", 0.0006238070740966464]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWho says we aren\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cI can feel it,\u201d she said solemnly.\nHaley\u2019s adoration turned to cool resentment.

He started to pick up a checker piece, but threw it down again, and marched through the now-empty kitchen and into the night. Her words rang in his ears, but he did not consciously consider them. He felt only the urge to walk away, to lose himself in darkness, to cleanse himself in silence. The moon had risen, and shone between fringes of cloud skeins that moved overhead.\nHis feet carried him with a will of their own, over the hard-earth of the barnyard, over the worn-slick planks of the barn floor, up a ladder, and into the cavern-like sanctuary of the loft. He felt his way through the narrow corridor that had been left between the stacked hay bales until he came at last to its end, marked by the pale square of light from the small window which overlooked the farmhouse. He sat beneath the window without first peering through it. He gathered his knees in his folded arms, and rested his head against them. His eyes closed slowly, noting last of all a shred of white cloth tied to the wire of a nearby bale. A part of the jumbled, unpleasant past weeks, he shut it out with his heavy lids.\nVIII.", -0.060570252792475014], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["cripples",

He was on crutches. He had only one leg. He was so jammed between his crutches that his shoulders hid his ears.\nBilly knew what the cripples were up to: They were selling subscriptions to magazines that would never come. People subscribed to them because the salesmen were so pitiful. Billy had heard about this racket from a speaker at the Lions Club two weeks before\u2014a man from the Better Business Bureau. The man said that anybody who saw cripples working a neighborhood for magazine subscriptions should call the police.\nBilly looked down the street, saw a new Buick Riviera parked about half a block away. There was a man in it, and Billy assumed correctly that he was the man who had hired the cripples to do this thing. Billy went on weeping as he contemplated the cripples and their boss. His doorchimes clanged hellishly.\nHe closed his eyes, and opened them again. He was still weeping, but he was back in Luxembourg again. He was marching with a lot of other prisoners. It was a winter wind that was bringing tears to his eyes.\nEver since Billy had been thrown into shrubbery for the sake of a picture, he had been seeing Saint Elmo\u2019s fire, a sort of electronic radiance around the heads of his companions and captors. It was in the treetops and on the rooftops of Luxembourg, too. It was beautiful.\nBilly was marching with his hands on top of his head, and so were all the other Americans. Billy was bobbing up-and-down, up-and-down. Now he crashed into Roland Weary accidentally. \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d he said.\nWeary\u2019s eyes were tearful also. Weary was crying because of horrible pains in his feet. The hinged clogs were transforming his feet into blood puddings.\nAt each road intersection Billy\u2019s group was joined by more Americans with their hands on top of their haloed heads. Billy had smiles for them all. They were moving like water, downhill all the time, and they flowed at last to a main highway on a valley\u2019s floor. Through the valley flowed a Mississippi of humiliated Americans. Tens of thousands of Americans shuffled eastward, their hands clasped on top of their heads. They sighed and groaned.\nBilly and his group joined the river of humiliation, and the late afternoon sun came out from the clouds. The Americans didn\u2019t have the road to themselves. The westbound lane boiled and boomed with vehicles which were rushing German reserves to the front. The reserves were violent, windburned, bristly men. They had teeth like piano keys.\nThey were festooned with machine-gun belts, smoked cigars and guzzled booze. They took wolfish bites from sausages, patted their horny palms with potato-masher grenades.", 0.02640036730945822], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["truth", 0.1343783235398207], ["magazine", 0.1209744715599217], ["crash", 0.11459894152237285], ["moonmist", 0.10498544904748104], ["market", 0.09780503681088372], ["beatrice", 0.09649001331387567], ["stock", 0.09207158836910798], ["unhappily", 0.08029144093881642], ["sense", 0.07800083165202816], ["character", 0.07038933835938864], ["retreated", 0.07038933835938864], ["responsibility", 0.07038933835938864], ["halley", 0.07038933835938864], ["comet", 0.07038933835938864], ["ad", 0.06459697967212914], ["equal", 0.06459697967212914], ["failed", 0.06459697967212914], ["naturally", 0.06459697967212914], ["rage", 0.06459697967212914], ["cigarettes", 0.06459697967212914], ["amount", 0.06459697967212914], ["rumfoord", 0.06453140702242008], ["argument", 0.06048723577996085], ["warn", 0.06048723577996085], ["spared", 0.06048723577996085], ["natural", 0.06048723577996085], ["tobacco", 0.06048723577996085], ["rocked", 0.057299470761186425], ["failure", 0.057299470761186425], ["worked", 0.057299470761186425], ["lines", 0.057299470761186425], ["infundibula", 0.054694877092701356], ["color", 0.05058513320053306], ["punctual", 0.05058513320053306], ["spread", 0.04890251840544186], ["center", 0.04890251840544186], ["coming", 0.04603579418455399], ["hung", 0.04603579418455399], ["size", 0.04479277451327356], ["bought", 0.04479277451327356], ["head", 0.04220760398073192], ["talking", 0.040683030621105266], ["opened", 0.040683030621105266], ["hands", 0.03900041582601408], ["synclastic", 0.03822802695072442], ["air", 0.03549866642554286], ["order", 0.028706899329613223], ["told", 0.02759316302290305], ["god", 0.024405398004128626], ["chrono", 0.019598651766682726], ["going", 0.01842382179186884], ["malachi", 0.018237077769478086], ["constant", 0.01275732924292585]], "sentiment": ["Rumfoord hung his head. \"I\u2019ve failed you in some way?

I was a candidate for a master\u2019s degree, mind you, for the rank of Corporal in Academia. He said my dissertation should deal with the sort of leadership required if a radical change in a culture was to be effected. Why mess around?\nSo I did it. He told me to compare the leadership which inspired a peaceful Indian tribe to fight the United States Army, the so-called \u201cGhost Dance,\u201d with the leadership of the Cubists, who found brand-new things to do with surfaces and paint. He didn\u2019t say so, but he had already done this. And, thus directed, I reached a conclusion he must have reached.\nBut my thesis was rejected by the department, as both grandiose and non-anthropological. And I was out of time and money, and I accepted a job in what was then arguably the most prosperous and compassionate socialist state in history, the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York.\nFor whatever it may be worth, and it may be worth no more than \u201ca pitcher of warm spit,\u201d as we used to say in the Army: The leadership of both the Ghost Dance and the Cubist movement had these elements in common:\nA charismatic, gifted leader who described cultural changes which should be made;\nTwo or more respected citizens who testified that this leader was not a lunatic, but was well worth listening to;\nA glib, personable explainer, who told the general public what the leader was up to, why he was so wonderful, and so on, day after day.\nTurns out that such a table of organization worked pretty well for Adolf Hitler, too, and maybe for Robert Maynard Hutchins, when he turned this place inside out and upside down sixty years ago.\nI was in Chicago a couple of years back on business, and visited my old department. Professor Sol Tax was the only teacher from my time still on the job. I asked after some of my old classmates, kibbutzniks whose theses had been acceptable. One he said was practicing urban anthropology in Boston, and I allowed as how I had worked for a couple of years in an ad agency there.\nI told him what I\u2019ve told you, how much I owed Dr. Z. I didn\u2019t comment on Z\u2019s having been low man on the department\u2019s totem pole, the Mespoulets. I would be very happy, incidentally, if that word, \u201cMespoulets,\u201d became a part of academic conversations, identifying that faculty member stuck with being mentor to all the nobodies going nowhere. In ad agencies it is common to start out in the mail room.

And this man, little more than a boy, was so innocent that he believed the dream could come true, since he had no bad habits and was willing to work so hard, if only he could get some hints on succeeding in life from people who were already millionaires.\nHe had tried, without much satisfaction, to get some advice on living well from James Wait downstairs, who, while so laughably unprepossessing, had a wallet stuffed, as Ortiz had observed respectfully, with credit cards and American twenty-dollar bills.\nHe thought this about the steaks, too, as he knocked on Selena\u2019s door: The people inside there deserved them, and that he would deserve them, too, once he had become a millionaire. And this was a highly intelligent and enterprising young man. Working in Guayaquil hotels since he was ten years old, he had become fluent in six languages, which was more than half as many languages as Gokubi knew, and six times as many languages as James Wait or Mary Hepburn knew, and three times as many languages as the Hiroguchis knew, and two times as many languages as the MacIntoshes knew. He was also a good cook and baker, and had taken a course in accounting and another in business law in night school.\nSo his inclination was to like whatever he saw and heard as Selena let him into the room. He already knew her green eyes were blind. Otherwise, he would have been fooled. She did not act or look as though she were blind. She was so beautiful. His big brain had him fall in love with her.\n*Andrew MacIntosh was standing at the floor-to-ceiling window wall, looking out over the marsh and slums at the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, which he expected to be his, or perhaps Selena\u2019s, or perhaps the Hiroguchis\u2019, before the sun went down. The person who was going to call him at five-thirty, the head of an emergency consortium of financiers in Quito, high in the clouds, was Gottfried von Kleist, chairman of the board of the largest bank of Ecuador, an uncle of the manager of the El Dorado and the captain of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, and co-owner with his elder brother Wilhelm of the ship and the hotel.\nTurning to look at Ortiz, who had just come in with the filet mignons, *MacIntosh was rehearsing in his head the first thing he was going to say to Gottfried von Kleist in Spanish: \u201cBefore you tell me the rest of the good news, dear colleague, give me your word of honor that I am gazing at my own ship in the distance, from the top floor of my own hotel.\u201d\n*MacIntosh was barefoot and wearing nothing but a pair of khaki shorts whose fly was unbuttoned and under which he wore no underwear, so that his penis was no more a secret than the pendulum on a grandfather clock.\nYes, and I pause to marvel now at how little interested this man was in reproduction, in being a huge success biologically\u2014despite his exhibitionistic sexuality and his mania for claiming as his own property as many of the planet\u2019s life-support systems as possible. The most famous amassers of survival schemes back then typically had very few children. There were exceptions, of course. Those who did reproduce a lot, though, and who might be thought to want so much property for the comfort of their descendants, commonly made psychological cripples of their own children. Their heirs were more often than not zombies, easily fleeced by men and women as greedy as the person who had left them much too much of everything a human animal could ever want or need.\n*Andrew MacIntosh didn\u2019t even care if he himself lived or died\u2014as evidenced by his enthusiasms for skydiving and the racing of high-performance motor vehicles and so on.\nSo I have to say that human brains back then had become such copious and irresponsible generators of suggestions as to what might be done with life, that they made acting for the benefit of future generations seem one of many arbitrary games which might be played by narrow enthusiasts\u2014like poker or polo or the bond market, or the writing of science-fiction novels.", 0.18094135802469136], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["europe", 0.09884659435972822], ["europeans", 0.07821666243121268], ["spoiled", 0.07283942743211398], ["civilized", 0.04937573578259802], ["geography", 0.04937573578259802], ["pray", 0.04937573578259802], ["paranoia", 0.04937573578259802], ["stopover", 0.04937573578259802], ["suckered", 0.04937573578259802], ["sipping", 0.04937573578259802], ["countries", 0.04937573578259802], ["cartoons", 0.04937573578259802], ["legal", 0.04937573578259802], ["syphilis", 0.04937573578259802], ["shrivel", 0.04937573578259802], ["zombie", 0.04937573578259802], ["coates", 0.04937573578259802], ["cannons", 0.04937573578259802], ["raisin", 0.04937573578259802], ["praecox", 0.04937573578259802], ["bloodthirsty", 0.04937573578259802], ["borders", 0.04937573578259802], ["sufficient", 0.04937573578259802], ["unhappier", 0.04937573578259802], ["providing", 0.04937573578259802], ["prayed", 0.04937573578259802], ["dementia", 0.04937573578259802], ["cafe", 0.04937573578259802], ["republic", 0.04937573578259802], ["pardon", 0.0428977247493275], ["knock", 0.0428977247493275], ["discussing", 0.0428977247493275], ["cities", 0.0428977247493275], ["contented", 0.0428977247493275], ["beer", 0.0428977247493275], ["creations", 0.0428977247493275], ["arnold", 0.0428977247493275], ["armies", 0.0428977247493275], ["blamed", 0.0428977247493275], ["sit", 0.0428977247493275], ["magnificent", 0.03910833121560634], ["editor", 0.03910833121560634], ["forward", 0.03910833121560634], ["newspaper", 0.03910833121560634], ["tonight", 0.03910833121560634], ["european", 0.03910833121560634], ["opportunity", 0.03910833121560634], ["beautiful", 0.038585568296631546], ["innocent", 0.03641971371605699], ["8", 0.03641971371605699], ["guns", 0.03641971371605699], ["midst", 0.03641971371605699], ["worry", 0.03641971371605699], ["drawing", 0.03641971371605699], ["wine", 0.03641971371605699], ["suicide", 0.032630320182335824], ["coffee", 0.032630320182335824], ["literature", 0.032630320182335824], ["empire", 0.031189659623202567], ["music", 0.031189659623202567], ["americans", 0.02994170268278647], ["meat", 0.02884092664861466], ["names", 0.02884092664861466], ["kill", 0.027856248932186377], ["artists", 0.027856248932186377], ["machine", 0.026965499588220726], ["will", 0.02639257416504855], ["reason", 0.026152309149065307], ["perfectly", 0.026152309149065307], ["hope", 0.025404246460527583], ["soldier", 0.024711648589932054], ["standing", 0.024711648589932054], ["hours", 0.023463691649515953], ["depression", 0.02289710639889507], ["painters", 0.021857614481977084], ["wrong", 0.021857614481977084], ["books", 0.021378237898915863], ["time", 0.02074511064863508], ["remember", 0.01967429811579479], ["call", 0.019292784148315773], ["love", 0.018926235427257066], ["artist", 0.018233637556661537], ["person", 0.018233637556661537], ["real", 0.017282397422923756], ["course", 0.01669809502122905], ["american", 0.01669809502122905], ["york", 0.014669454785361502], ["big", 0.014444244022940375], ["thing", 0.014224332832190897], ["painting", 0.01379945083147354], ["father", 0.012448224393986553], ["art", 0.01175562652339102], ["dan", 0.011427670263472607], ["great", 0.011427670263472607], ["told", 0.010507669582974923], ["gregory", 0.010507669582974923], ["going", 0.009804646954586254], ["war", 0.00915082836947494]], "sentiment": ["DAN GREGORY.\n8\nTHE FIRST PERSON I told about this magnificent opportunity was the old newspaper editor for whom I had been drawing cartoons.

He\u2019s a perfectly contented, self-sufficient zombie, if you\u2019ll pardon my saying so.\n\u201cNew York is just going to be a stopover for you,\u201d he went on. \u201cEurope is where the real painters are, and always will be.\u201d\nHe was wrong about that.\n\u201cI never prayed before, but I\u2019ll pray tonight that you never go to Europe as a soldier. We should never get suckered again into providing meat for the cannons and machine guns they love so much. They could go to war at any time. Look how big their armies are in the midst of a Great Depression!\n\u201cIf the cities are still standing when you get to Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cand you sit in a cafe for hours, sipping coffee or wine or beer, and discussing painting and music and literature, just remember that the Europeans around you, who you think are so much more civilized than Americans, are looking forward to just one thing: the time when it will become legal to kill each other and knock everything down again.\n\u201cIf I had my way,\u201d he said, \u201cAmerican geography books would call those European countries by their right names: \u201cThe Syphilis Empire,\u201d \u201cThe Republic of Suicide,\u201d \u201cDementia Praecox,\u201d which of course borders on beautiful \u201cParanoia.\u201d\n\u201cThere!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoiled Europe for you, and you haven\u2019t even seen it yet. And maybe I\u2019ve spoiled art for you, too, but I hope not. I don\u2019t see how artists can be blamed if their beautiful and usually innocent creations for some reason just make Europeans unhappier and more bloodthirsty all the time.\u201d",

standup comedian at the end of the world. It is about making jokes while we are killing all the fish in the ocean, and touching off the last chunks or drops or whiffs of fossil fuel. But it will not let itself be finished.\nIts working title\u2014or actually, its nonworking title\u2014is If God Were Alive Today. And hey, listen, it is time we thanked God that we are in a country where even the poor people are overweight. But the Bush diet could change that.\nAnd about the novel I can never finish, If God Were Alive Today, the hero, the stand-up comedian on Doomsday, not only does he denounce our addiction to fossil fuels and the pushers in the White House, because of overpopulation he is also against sexual intercourse. Gil Berman tells his audiences:\nI have become a flaming neuter. I am as celibate as at least fifty percent of the heterosexual Roman Catholic clergy. And celibacy is no root canal. It\u2019s so cheap and convenient. Talk about safe sex! You don\u2019t have to do anything afterwards, because there is no afterward.\nAnd when my tantrum, which is what I call my TV set, flashes boobs and smiles in my face, and says everybody but me is going to get laid tonight, and this is a national emergency, so I\u2019ve got to rush out and buy a car or pills, or a folding gymnasium that I can hide under my bed, I laugh like a hyena. I know and you know that millions and millions of good Americans, present company not excepted, are not going to get laid tonight.\nAnd we flaming neuters vote! I look forward to a day when the President of the United States, no less, who probably isn\u2019t going to get laid tonight either, decrees a National Neuter Pride Day. Out of our closets we\u2019ll come by the millions. Shoulders squared, chins held high, we\u2019ll go marching up Main Streets all over this boob-crazed democracy of ours, laughing like hyenas.\nWhat about God? If He were alive today? Gil Berman says, \u201cGod would have to be an atheist, because the excrement has hit the air-conditioning big time, big time.\u201d\nI think one of the biggest mistakes we\u2019re making, second only to being people, has to do with what time really is. We have all these instruments for slicing it up like a salami, clocks and calendars, and we name the slices as though we own them, and they can never change\u2014\u201c11:00 AM, November 11, 1918,\u201d for example\u2014when in fact they are as likely to break into pieces or go scampering off as dollops of mercury.\nMight not it be possible, then, that the Second World War was a cause of the first one? Otherwise, the first one remains inexplicable nonsense of the most gruesome kind. Or try this: Is it possible that seemingly incredible geniuses like Bach and Shakespeare and Einstein were not in fact superhuman, but simply plagiarists, copying great stuff from the future?\nOn Tuesday, January 20, 2004, I sent Joel Bleifuss, my editor at In These Times, this fax:", 0.12890243902439028], "title": "A Man without a Country"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["obituary", 0.1337755349631867], ["hardware", 0.1150857490873282], ["gunilla", 0.08918368997545781], ["thius", 0.08918368997545781], ["bo", 0.08918368997545781], ["chain", 0.07791300411269447], ["stores", 0.07132007552556986], ["morning", 0.05019352293808593], ["room", 0.04747719635819705], ["freight", 0.044591844987728904], ["globe", 0.044591844987728904], ["ernie", 0.044591844987728904], ["mortuary", 0.044591844987728904], ["conglomerate", 0.044591844987728904], ["manufacturing", 0.044591844987728904], ["shipping", 0.044591844987728904], ["packages", 0.044591844987728904], ["pyle", 0.044591844987728904], ["elevator", 0.044591844987728904], ["excite", 0.044591844987728904], ["rewrite", 0.044591844987728904], ["trotting", 0.044591844987728904], ["deft", 0.044591844987728904], ["city", 0.04320060650698408], ["indianapolis", 0.039869495897087714], ["homes", 0.038956502056347236], ["trick", 0.038956502056347236], ["wrecked", 0.038956502056347236], ["discount", 0.038956502056347236], ["summertime", 0.038956502056347236], ["rube", 0.038956502056347236], ["swedish", 0.038956502056347236], ["crowns", 0.038956502056347236], ["aftonbladet", 0.038956502056347236], ["telephoned", 0.038956502056347236], ["paper", 0.038200044187991965], ["desk", 0.03566003776278493], ["stylist", 0.03566003776278493], ["division", 0.03566003776278493], ["business", 0.03559284662579392], ["planetary", 0.03332115912496556], ["local", 0.03332115912496556], ["beat", 0.03332115912496556], ["sentimental", 0.03332115912496556], ["hoosier", 0.03332115912496556], ["flanner", 0.0315069839110289], ["janet", 0.0315069839110289], ["native", 0.0315069839110289], ["interested", 0.0315069839110289], ["9", 0.0315069839110289], ["star", 0.0315069839110289], ["citizen", 0.030024694831403256], ["writer", 0.029201910233767787], ["produced", 0.02877143727183205], ["innocence", 0.02877143727183205], ["1980", 0.02877143727183205], ["bed", 0.02877143727183205], ["closest", 0.02877143727183205], ["main", 0.027685816193583897], ["dear", 0.027685816193583897], ["honest", 0.027685816193583897], ["practical", 0.027685816193583897], ["appeared", 0.027685816193583897], ["charming", 0.027685816193583897], ["newspaper", 0.027685816193583897], ["york", 0.027286738922281874], ["told", 0.026579663931391814], ["die", 0.025871640979647233], ["bought", 0.025871640979647233], ["store", 0.025871640979647233], ["subject", 0.025096761469042966], ["sold", 0.025096761469042966], ["funeral", 0.025096761469042966], ["essay", 0.02438935190002159], ["discovered", 0.02438935190002159], ["front", 0.023738598179098524], ["rate", 0.023738598179098524], ["letter", 0.02257517668608492], ["door", 0.019461418537661295], ["company", 0.018754008968639917], ["lost", 0.018103255247716853], ["wanted", 0.018103255247716853], ["age", 0.018103255247716853], ["literary", 0.01779642331289696], ["knew", 0.01779642331289696], ["short", 0.017500751409068708], ["second", 0.017215456126050254], ["heard", 0.017215456126050254], ["died", 0.015686576195132043], ["high", 0.015457544675077603], ["school", 0.015017973770441215], ["times", 0.015017973770441215], ["wrote", 0.014806790954154542], ["people", 0.013665138769907029], ["day", 0.013464679162614311], ["asked", 0.013289831965695907], ["work", 0.012625782933059588], ["write", 0.01216108038151529], ["war", 0.010907822821944083], ["vonnegut", 0.010051233263750374], ["will", 0.007654489034314237]], "sentiment": ["Janet Flanner was the most deft and charming literary stylist Indianapolis has so far produced, and the one who came closest to being a planetary citizen, too. She was not a local writer. Neither was she, like another Hoosier writer, Ernie Pyle, a globe-trotting rube.\nSo when she died here in New York, I wanted to make sure that her native city knew about it. I telephoned the city desk of The Indianapolis Star, a morning paper being put to bed. Nobody in the city room had ever heard of her. Neither was anybody much interested when I told of all she had done.\nBut then I found a way to excite them, to get them to run a front page obituary, which was a rewrite of the obituary that had appeared in that morning\u2019s New York Times.\nWhat did the trick? I told them that she was somehow related to the people who ran the funeral homes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI myself will get an obituary in an Indianapolis paper when I die because I am related to people who used to own a chain of hardware stores. The chain was wrecked by discount stores after the Second World War. It had a manufacturing division, which made door hardware, and that was bought by a conglomerate. It beat the mortuary business, at any rate.\nI used to work in the main store of the Vonnegut Hardware Company in the summertime, when I was high school age. I ran a freight elevator. I made up packages in the shipping room, and so on. I liked what we sold. It was all so honest and practical.\nAnd I discovered only the other day how sentimental I still was about the hardware business\u2014when I was asked by one Gunilla Bo\u00ebthius of Aftonbladet, a Swedish newspaper, to write for one thousand crowns a short essay on this subject: \u201cWhen I Lost My Innocence.\u201d\nOn May 9, 1980, I wrote this letter:\nDear Gunilla Bo\u00ebthius\u2014", 0.2003359683794466], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["robert", 0.17437808869007645], ["uncle", 0.1672131606156465], ["charley", 0.14015352652768598], ["aunt", 0.12975501124442654], ["guardian", 0.1052115094977974], ["cod", 0.07014100633186493], ["worry", 0.0668852642462586], ["mary", 0.0668852642462586], ["cape", 0.0668852642462586], ["bank", 0.05964481588718423], ["lived", 0.057763378107580185], ["solitude", 0.04944048452695122], ["boarder", 0.04944048452695122], ["accounting", 0.04944048452695122], ["custodianship", 0.04944048452695122], ["decisions", 0.04944048452695122], ["commission", 0.04944048452695122], ["documents", 0.04944048452695122], ["remark", 0.04944048452695122], ["aluminum", 0.04944048452695122], ["dependence", 0.04944048452695122], ["chrysler", 0.04944048452695122], ["evaporated", 0.04944048452695122], ["person", 0.045385749883295454], ["nancy", 0.04368378238678965], ["knocking", 0.043251670414808846], ["screens", 0.043251670414808846], ["roamed", 0.043251670414808846], ["salesman", 0.043251670414808846], ["perform", 0.043251670414808846], ["surprises", 0.043251670414808846], ["responsibility", 0.043251670414808846], ["expecting", 0.043251670414808846], ["combination", 0.043251670414808846], ["merchants", 0.043251670414808846], ["emotional", 0.043251670414808846], ["typical", 0.043251670414808846], ["likes", 0.039631446235271664], ["sad", 0.039631446235271664], ["duties", 0.039631446235271664], ["automatically", 0.039631446235271664], ["financial", 0.03706285630266648], ["trust", 0.03706285630266648], ["law", 0.03706285630266648], ["doors", 0.03706285630266648], ["storm", 0.03706285630266648], ["restaurant", 0.03706285630266648], ["large", 0.03706285630266648], ["day", 0.03539261081302005], ["atlantic", 0.035070503165932465], ["lunch", 0.0334426321231293], ["distance", 0.0334426321231293], ["strangers", 0.032066286767528776], ["surprise", 0.032066286767528776], ["windows", 0.032066286767528776], ["years", 0.030128333309079963], ["simply", 0.029822407943592116], ["straight", 0.029822407943592116], ["age", 0.029822407943592116], ["deal", 0.028881689053790092], ["sign", 0.028881689053790092], ["meet", 0.028881689053790092], ["thirty", 0.028881689053790092], ["going", 0.028392788907330272], ["hope", 0.028030705305537196], ["birthday", 0.028030705305537196], ["twelve", 0.025877472655386407], ["hadn", 0.02363359383144975], ["street", 0.02225724847584923], ["married", 0.020700521804913715], ["dead", 0.020013369651912565], ["company", 0.019375343187786272], ["told", 0.01877988448690527], ["boy", 0.017955122700021205], ["called", 0.017955122700021205], ["will", 0.017444779719307378], ["house", 0.017200146021199215], ["twenty", 0.016730112686507946], ["wasn", 0.014692089008106337], ["big", 0.012169169617168745]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d said Robert.

take that away from me,\u201d he said.\nONE LETTER IS from an old bell-puller, very likely dead by now, a member of the Class of 1924 who had married a man named Marthinus de Wet, the owner of a gold mine in Krugersdorp, South Africa. She knew the history of the bells, that they had been made from weapons gathered up after the Battle of Gettysburg. She did not mind that the bells would soon be played electrically. The bad idea, as far as she was concerned, was that the sour bells, Pickle and Lemon and Big Cracked John and Beelzebub, were going to be turned on lathes in Belgium until they were either in tune or on the scrap heap.\n\u201cAre Tarkington students no longer to be humanized and humbled as I was day after day,\u201d she asked, \u201cby the cries from the bell tower of the dying on the sacred, blood-soaked grounds of Gettysburg?\u201d\nThe bells controversy inspired a lot of purple prose like that, much of it dictated to a secretary or a machine, no doubt. It is quite possible that Mrs. de Wet graduated from Tarkington without being able to write any better than most of the ill-educated prisoners across the lake.\nIF MY SOCIALIST grandfather, nothing but a gardener at Butler University, could read the letter from Mrs. de Wet and note its South African return address, he would be grimly gratified. There was a clear-as-crystal demonstration of a woman living high on profits from the labor of black miners, overworked and underpaid.\nHe would have seen exploitation of the poor and powerless in the growth of the prison across the lake as well. The prison to him would have been a scheme for depriving the lower social orders of leadership in the Class Struggle and for providing them with a horrible alternative to accepting whatever their greedy paymasters would give them in the way of working conditions and subsistence.\nBy the time I got to Tarkington College, though, he would have been wrong about the meaning of the prison across the lake, since poor and powerless people, no matter how docile, were no longer of use to canny investors. What they used to do was now being done by heroic and uncomplaining machinery.\nSo an appropriate sign to put over the gate to Athena might have been, instead of \u201cWork Makes Free,\u201d for example: \u201cToo bad you were born.

She was Mary Young. She was one hundred and eight years old. She was black. Mary Young\u2019s parents had been human slaves in Kentucky.\nThere was a tiny connection between Mary Young and Dwayne Hoover. She did the laundry for Dwayne\u2019s family for a few months, back when Dwayne was a little boy. She told Bible stories and stories about slavery to little Dwayne. She told him about a public hanging of a white man she had seen in Cincinnati, when she was a little girl.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA black intern at the County Hospital now watched Mary Young die of pneumonia.\nThe intern did not know her. He had been in Midland City for only a week. He wasn\u2019t even a fellow-American, although he had taken his medical degree at Harvard. He was an Indaro. He was a Nigerian. His name was Cyprian Ukwende. He felt no kinship with Mary or with any American blacks. He felt kinship only with Indaros.\nAs she died, Mary was as alone on the planet as were Dwayne Hoover or Kilgore Trout. She had never reproduced. There were no friends or relatives to watch her die. So she spoke her very last words on the planet to Cyprian Ukwende. She did not have enough breath left to make her vocal cords buzz. She could only move her lips noiselessly.\nHere is all she had to say about death: \u201cOh my, oh my.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLike all Earthlings at the point of death, Mary Young sent faint reminders of herself to those who had known her. She released a small cloud of telepathic butterflies, and one of these brushed the cheek of Dwayne Hoover, nine miles away.\nDwayne heard a tired voice from somewhere behind his head, even though no one was back there.
