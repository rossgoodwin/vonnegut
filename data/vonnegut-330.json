It was set to music by composer Edgar Grana and translated into Church Latin by NYU professor John F. Collins.\nDear Harry James\u2014\n[\u2026] You remind me spiritually of another Catholic, Heinrich B\u00f6ll, who was carrying war guilt almost all by himself by the time he died. His neighbors scorned him for that, he said. They scarcely spoke to him. One thing I seem to be doing all by myself is pointing out in speeches that the German swastika was considered a cross, and was called one. You want to join me in making this revelation? It is wrong that people are comforted by the belief that its meaning is anti-Christian.\nSorry about your illness, but I can\u2019t help feeling that all you people who were super-jocks in childhood were simply begging for infirmities in late middle age.\nDid I tell you I wrote a new Requiem, a secular humanist job which is a paraphrase of the Council of Trent monstrosity? I did it in English, and had it translated into Church Latin by an NYU professor. It took a composer I met on jury duty two years to set the Latin to music, and we may get a world premiere in a Unitarian Church in Buffalo, which has a very ambitious choral program. Do you hate Unitarians? How can you, when you know perfectly well the scruffy origins of the trinitarian nonsense?\nCheers\u2014", -0.04505347593582889], "title": "Letters"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["herb", 0.15827700287578456], ["sheila", 0.12979665087419048], ["morris", 0.12090091897306263], ["ell", 0.07787799052451429], ["chair", 0.07240465081829403], ["fleetwoods", 0.06544733970156207], ["house", 0.06331762868272031], ["windows", 0.043248196081781376], ["floor", 0.04235800958333212], ["books", 0.041521807903105425], ["pans", 0.040300306324354204], ["installed", 0.040300306324354204], ["photographs", 0.040300306324354204], ["shangrila", 0.040300306324354204], ["washing", 0.040300306324354204], ["tobacco", 0.040300306324354204], ["gloop", 0.040300306324354204], ["lantern", 0.040300306324354204], ["chopping", 0.040300306324354204], ["measure", 0.040300306324354204], ["hideaway", 0.040300306324354204], ["slup", 0.040300306324354204], ["handyman", 0.040300306324354204], ["intruding", 0.040300306324354204], ["baseball", 0.040300306324354204], ["twin", 0.040300306324354204], ["pots", 0.040300306324354204], ["kerosene", 0.040300306324354204], ["oceanographer", 0.040300306324354204], ["whirr", 0.040300306324354204], ["custer", 0.040300306324354204], ["sheets", 0.040300306324354204], ["canned", 0.040300306324354204], ["woodpile", 0.040300306324354204], ["door", 0.03996251196420442], ["freely", 0.035519980941182173], ["climb", 0.035519980941182173], ["tremendous", 0.035519980941182173], ["gasoline", 0.035519980941182173], ["window", 0.034639171129050426], ["handy", 0.03272366985078103], ["nicely", 0.03272366985078103], ["notes", 0.03272366985078103], ["pipes", 0.03272366985078103], ["print", 0.03272366985078103], ["goods", 0.03272366985078103], ["neighbor", 0.03272366985078103], ["rattle", 0.03272366985078103], ["sash", 0.03272366985078103], ["hanging", 0.030739655558010132], ["team", 0.030739655558010132], ["cozy", 0.030739655558010132], ["comfortable", 0.030739655558010132], ["studying", 0.030739655558010132], ["automatic", 0.030739655558010132], ["lit", 0.02920073451446386], ["housewife", 0.02920073451446386], ["hearing", 0.02920073451446386], ["knocked", 0.02920073451446386], ["anytime", 0.02920073451446386], ["condition", 0.027943344467609], ["knock", 0.027943344467609], ["heavy", 0.027943344467609], ["magazines", 0.027943344467609], ["storm", 0.027943344467609], ["range", 0.02688023633086929], ["ordered", 0.02688023633086929], ["school", 0.026641674642802947], ["couch", 0.025959330174838095], ["lying", 0.025959330174838095], ["crying", 0.025147033377207865], ["main", 0.025147033377207865], ["early", 0.025147033377207865], ["walls", 0.025147033377207865], ["color", 0.025147033377207865], ["cigarette", 0.025147033377207865], ["jobs", 0.02442040913129182], ["block", 0.02442040913129182], ["machine", 0.02442040913129182], ["leaned", 0.02376309754643441], ["free", 0.02376309754643441], ["decided", 0.02376309754643441], ["girls", 0.02316301908443696], ["answer", 0.02316301908443696], ["closed", 0.022611000410826365], ["working", 0.022611000410826365], ["feeling", 0.022611000410826365], ["big", 0.021805028137793715], ["top", 0.021624098040890688], ["laid", 0.02117900479166606], ["kitchen", 0.02117900479166606], ["afternoon", 0.02117900479166606], ["army", 0.020760903951552712], ["bed", 0.020760903951552712], ["start", 0.020366707994035827], ["happened", 0.019993830605964963], ["glad", 0.019993830605964963], ["stand", 0.019640083748119784], ["age", 0.019640083748119784], ["playing", 0.019640083748119784], ["inside", 0.01898277216326237], ["heart", 0.018382693701264923], ["living", 0.017319585564525213], ["felt", 0.017077576462378525], ["office", 0.015980578568380678], ["find", 0.015034363937253195], ["will", 0.015034363937253195], ["sat", 0.015034363937253195], ["high", 0.01468946448501415], ["long", 0.013460166337384366], ["wanted", 0.013184267477979544], ["love", 0.01183731056542254], ["room", 0.011618354025321985], ["thing", 0.010343027552949488], ["man", 0.00657376061248004]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI\u2019ll have a little house all my own,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll be my own little housewife. And anytime Sheila wants to, she can come knock on my door and find out I still love her. She can start studying books again, and become an oceanographer or whatever she wants. And any handyman jobs she needs done on that big old house of hers, her handy neighbor\u2014which is me\u2014will be more than glad to do.\u201d\nWith a very heavy heart I went out to Herb\u2019s house early that afternoon to measure the windows of the ell. Herb was at his office. The twin girls were off at school. Sheila didn\u2019t seem to be at home, either. I knocked on the kitchen door, and the only answer I got was from the automatic washing machine.\n\u201cWhirr, gloop, rattle, slup,\u201d it said.\nAs long as I was there, I decided to make sure the Fleetwoods I\u2019d already installed were working freely. That was how I happened to look in through the living room window and see Sheila lying on the couch. There were books on the floor around her. She was crying.\nWhen I got around to the ell I could see that Herb had certainly been playing house in there. He had a little kerosene range on top of the woodpile, along with pots and pans and canned goods.\nThere was a Morris chair with a gasoline lantern hanging over it, and a big chopping block next to the chair, and Herb had his pipes and his magazines and his tobacco laid out there. His bed was on the floor, but it was nicely made, with sheets and all. On the walls were photographs of Herb in the Army, Herb on the high school baseball team, and a tremendous print in color of Custer\u2019s Last Stand.\nThe door between the ell and the main house was closed, so I felt free to climb in through a window without feeling I was intruding on Sheila. What I wanted to see was the condition of the sash on the inside. I sat down in the Morris chair and made some notes.\nAnd then I leaned back and lit a cigarette. A Morris chair is a comfortable thing. Sheila came in without my even hearing her.\n\u201cCozy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cI think every man your age should have a hideaway.

He talked in German, a language he had sworn never to use again.\n\"They don\u2019t care,\" said Heinz. \"They\u2019re all too busy, busy, busy to notice life, to feel anything about it. A baby is born.\" He shrugged. \"What could be duller? Who would be so stupid as to talk about it, to think there was anything important or interesting about it?\"\nHe opened a window on the summer night, and looked out at the moonlit canyon of gray wooden porches and garbage cans. \"There are too many of us, and we are all too far apart,\" said Heinz. \"Another Knechtmann is born, another O\u2019Leary, another Sousa. Who cares? Why should anyone care? What difference does it make? None.\"\nHe lay down in his clothes on the unmade bed, and, with a rattling sigh, went to sleep.\nHe awoke at six, as always. He drank a cup of coffee, and with a wry sense of anonymity, he jostled and was jostled aboard the downtown train. His face showed no emotion. It was like all the other faces, seemingly incapable of surprise or wonder, joy or anger.\nHe walked across town to the hospital with the same detachment, a gray, uninteresting man, a part of the city.\nIn the hospital, he was as purposeful and calm as the doctors and nurses bustling about him. When he was led into the ward where Avchen slept behind white screens, he felt only what he had always felt in her presence\u2014love and aching awe and gratitude for her.\n\"You go ahead and wake her gently, Mr. Netman,\" said the nurse.", 0.02372685185185187], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
