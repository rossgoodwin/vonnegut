Nothing about me has ever been original. I repeated what my onetime hero, Kenneth Whistler, had said in reply to the same general sort of question long, long ago. Whistler had been a witness at a trial of strikers accused of violence. The judge had become curious about him, had asked him why such a well-educated man from such a good family would so immerse himself in the working class.\nMy stolen answer to Nixon was this: \u201cWhy? The Sermon on the Mount, sir.\u201d\nThere was polite applause when the people at the party realized that the phonograph record had ended.\nGood-bye.\n\u2014W.F.S.\nJAILBIRD\nA Dial Press Trade

minutes,\" said Chrono, looking at his watch. He was eleven Earthling years old now. He was dark and smoldering. He was an expert short-changer, and was clever with cards. He was foul-mouthed, and carried a switch-knife with a six-inch blade. Chrono would not socialize well with other children, and his reputation for dealing with life courageously and directly was so bad that only a few very foolish and very pretty little girls were attracted to him.\nChrono was classified by the Newport Police Department and by the Rhode Island State Police as a juvenile delinquent. He knew at least fifty law-enforcement officers by their first names, and was a veteran of fourteen lie-detector tests.\nAll that prevented Chrono\u2019s being placed in an institution was the finest legal staff on Earth, the legal staff of the Church of God the Utterly Indifferent. Under the direction of Rumfoord, the staff defended Chrono against all charges.\nThe commonest charges brought against Chrono were larceny by sleight of hand, carrying concealed weapons, possessing unregistered pistols, discharging firearms within the city limits, selling obscene prints and articles, and being a wayward child.\nThe authorities complained bitterly that the boy\u2019s big trouble was his mother. His mother loved him just the way he was.\n\"Only eight more minutes to get your Malachi, folks,\" said Bee. \"Hurry, hurry, hurry.\"\nBee\u2019s upper front teeth were gold, and her skin, like the skin of her son, was the color of golden oak.\nBee had lost her upper front teeth when the space ship in which she and Chrono had ridden from Mars crash-landed in the Gumbo region of the Amazon Rain Forest. She and Chrono had been the only survivors of the crash, and had wandered through the jungles for a year.\nThe color of Bee\u2019s and Chrono\u2019s skins was permanent, since it stemmed from a modification of their livers. Their livers had been modified by a three-month diet consisting of water and the roots of the salpa-salpa or Amazonian blue poplar.

What a lark for a sweet old man like me.\nBefore I took the job at Iowa, George Starbuck told me with all possible delicacy that I should probably read a book before facing a class. I asked him to name a good one, and he suggested Madame Bovary. I have since suspected that, if I had asked him to name two good novels, he would have been stuck for the name of a second one. At any rate, I read Madame Bovary, so I am able to ask this: \u201cWhy must some women be Emma Bovary, and why do all intelligent women understand that some women must be Emma Bovary, and what is the big or little trick which allows some women to escape from being Emma Bovary?\u201d\nI ask this question not as your thesis advisor but as a fellow human being. And I tell you that I find a simple answer which satisfies me in your book: \u201cSome women have to be Emma because they can\u2019t get interesting jobs.\u201d\nWell\u2014that part of me which asks such plonking questions is that part of me which did so well in Problems in Contemporary Western Civilization in Junior High School in Indianapolis a good many years ago.\nMy finer self acknowledges you as an absolutely first-rate artist who would respond to life with the right words and feelings no matter what, mechanically, life happened to be.
