I regret that I can\u2019t accept. I have a long-standing commitment to speak elsewhere at that time.\nIf I could be there, my speech would be a short one. The older my father became, the dumber he became, and the same thing is happening to me. I am not talking about Alzheimer\u2019s. I\u2019m talking about plain old age.\nI would probably have said to Legionnaires that veterans my age would all have gone to Vietnam, if that had been our war, even though, as Robert McNamara has now made clear, that war was loony-tunes. We were raised to believe that when our country went to war, no matter what the reason, healthy young men of every social class and degree of education should beg to serve. Not many people are raised that way any more, and most of the famous fire-eating patriots of today found ways to stay out of uniform when their country said it needed them. I don\u2019t like them.\nMy generation was extraordinarily lucky to have fought in that greatest of rarities, an unambiguously just war. I include Korea. And anyone who was actually in battles in those wars and survived found himself, as do I, a member of a great fraternity composed of all who have ever been in battle\u2014in any military service of any country, friend or foe. I can\u2019t tell you how much this fraternity has meant to me wherever in the whole wide world I go.\nCheers,\nKurt Vonnegut\n12102964\nVOLUNTEER\nOctober 11, 1995\nNew York City]", 0.22197440240918512], "title": "Letters"}}
