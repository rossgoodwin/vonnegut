works.\u201d He checked his own watch, the shock-proof, waterproof, antimagnetic, glow-in-the-dark, self-winding chronometer Anita had given him for Christmas, and found that the grandfather clock was off by about twelve minutes. Indulging an atavistic whim, he set his watch to correspond with the hands of the relic, which grated and creaked away the seconds, sounding like a wooden ship straining in a strong wind.\nThe house was certainly one of the oldest in the valley. The rough rafters were inches above Paul\u2019s head, and the fireplace was sooted black, and there wasn\u2019t a true right angle anywhere. The house seemed to have twisted and stretched on its foundations until it had found a position of comfort for all of its parts\u2014like a sleeping dog.\nMore remarkable than the way the house had relieved its stresses was the way it conformed to Paul\u2019s particular, not to say peculiar, needs. Here was a place where he could work with his hands, getting life from nature without being disturbed by any human beings other than his wife. Not only that, but Anita, with her love for things colonial, would be enchanted, stunned, even, by this completely authentic microcosm of the past.\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Doctor Pond, \u201cMr. Haycox at last. When you yell for him, he never yells back. Just starts coming, taking his own sweet time.\u201d\nPaul watched Mr. Haycox\u2019s heavy-footed progress across the hard-packed earth of the barnyard. The caretaker was an old man, with close-cropped white hair, coarse, tanned skin, and, like Rudy Hertz, with remarkably big hands. Unlike Rudy, Mr. Haycox wasn\u2019t desiccated. His flesh was firm, hard, and well colored. The chief toll he seemed to have paid time was in teeth, of which he had few. He might have been part of a pageant recalling farm life as it had once been. He wore old-fashioned blue denim overalls, a wide-brimmed straw hat, and heavy, crusty work shoes.\nAs though to point up the anachronism of Mr. Haycox and the Gottwald place for Paul, one of Doctor Ormand van Curler\u2019s men, riding on a tractor, appeared on the other side of the windbreak, snappy in spotless white coveralls, a red baseball cap, cool sandals which almost never touched the ground, and white gloves which, like Paul\u2019s hands, rarely touched anything but steering wheels, levers, and switches.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d said Mr. Haycox. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d His voice was strong. He had none of the sheepishness or obsequiousness Paul had seen so frequently in Reeks and Wrecks. Mr. Haycox bore himself as though he owned the place, wanted the talk to be as brief and pithy as possible, and doubted that whatever was wanted of him could possibly be more important than what he had been doing.\n\u201cDoctor Proteus\u2014this is Mr. Haycox.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d said Paul.\n\u201c \u2019Do,\u201d said Mr. Haycox. \u201cWhat kind of doctor?\u201d", 0.12393617021276593], "title": "Player Piano"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["crying", 0.11806433188621292], ["cried", 0.11531168854559333], ["trout", 0.08106575918657842], ["doctor", 0.07687445903039555], ["cry", 0.07333076524126318], ["bleeding", 0.05903216594310646], ["willy", 0.05903216594310646], ["sedated", 0.05903216594310646], ["prescribe", 0.05903216594310646], ["swede", 0.05903216594310646], ["redheaded", 0.05903216594310646], ["desperately", 0.05903216594310646], ["cot", 0.05903216594310646], ["resistant", 0.05903216594310646], ["father", 0.051662492321512966], ["vain", 0.05106495697115306], ["organisms", 0.05106495697115306], ["syphilis", 0.05106495697115306], ["weeping", 0.05106495697115306], ["scribbling", 0.05106495697115306], ["antibiotics", 0.05106495697115306], ["woke", 0.05106495697115306], ["corps", 0.04640443848715117], ["strong", 0.04640443848715117], ["notice", 0.04640443848715117], ["aware", 0.04640443848715117], ["bangkok", 0.04640443848715117], ["thailand", 0.04640443848715117], ["fully", 0.04640443848715117], ["kilgore", 0.04640443848715117], ["handed", 0.043097747999199666], ["surprised", 0.043097747999199666], ["effects", 0.043097747999199666], ["slept", 0.04053287959328921], ["medicine", 0.04053287959328921], ["office", 0.04053287959328921], ["hadn", 0.039875886330761064], ["cohoes", 0.03843722951519778], ["talking", 0.03843722951519778], ["watching", 0.03843722951519778], ["person", 0.03768484771456969], ["writer", 0.03666538262063159], ["met", 0.03666538262063159], ["science", 0.03513053902724628], ["walked", 0.03513053902724628], ["hard", 0.03377671103119589], ["fiction", 0.03377671103119589], ["wrong", 0.03377671103119589], ["hour", 0.03377671103119589], ["chance", 0.032565670621335814], ["baby", 0.032565670621335814], ["leave", 0.032565670621335814], ["heart", 0.03147015131324012], ["lived", 0.03047002054324438], ["selection", 0.029549989420560054], ["thinking", 0.029549989420560054], ["wonderful", 0.0286981736486782], ["learn", 0.027905152137333925], ["better", 0.027163330055292877], ["wasn", 0.026793253413750343], ["feel", 0.02646649532177064], ["marine", 0.02646649532177064], ["side", 0.02646649532177064], ["law", 0.025809502059242494], ["case", 0.025809502059242494], ["york", 0.02518803974579105], ["eyes", 0.024037655164676305], ["close", 0.024037655164676305], ["heard", 0.019937943165380532], ["natural", 0.019561048650173742], ["left", 0.018842423857284844], ["mother", 0.018499286349817245], ["thought", 0.017220830773837653], ["man", 0.014298599298156725], ["brain", 0.01159383967822035], ["big", 0.009405865787516681]], "sentiment": ["I hadn\u2019t come close to crying.

I hadn\u2019t even cried when my redheaded, left-handed mother had walked out on Father and me.\nBut then that Swede found something to say which made me cry like a baby\u2014at last, at last. He was as surprised as I was when I cried and cried.\nHere is what he said: \u201cI notice your name is Trout. Is there any chance that you are related to the wonderful science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout?\u201d\nThis doctor was the only person I ever met outside of Cohoes, New York, who had heard of my father.\nI had to come all the way to Bangkok, Thailand, to learn that in the eyes of one person, anyway, my desperately scribbling father had not lived in vain.\nThe doctor made me cry so much that I had to be sedated. When I woke up on a cot in his office an hour later, he was watching me. We were all alone.\n\u201cFeel better now?\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cOr maybe. It\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about your case while you slept,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is one very strong medicine I could prescribe, but I leave it up to you whether or not you want to try it. You should be fully aware of its side effects.\u201d\nI thought he was talking about how resistant syphilis organisms had become to antibiotics, thanks to the Law of Natural Selection.

Kerouac picked up the remainder of the deck, and he threw it across the kitchen.\nIt was then that Mark came in, unexpectedly home for a weekend from Swarthmore College, where he was a religion major. He was also a middleweight wrestler in very good shape. He wore a full beard and a work shirt and blue jeans, and carried a duffel bag. Everything about his costume and even his posture might have been inspired by Kerouac\u2019s books.\nThe moment Kerouac saw him, Kerouac stood and looked him over smolderingly from head to toe. The calm before a fight settled dankly over the room.\n\u201cYou think you understand me,\u201d said Kerouac to Mark. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand me at all. You want to fight about it?\u201d Mark said nothing, not knowing who Kerouac was or what he was so mad about.\nKerouac praised himself as a fighter, asked Mark if he really thought he was man enough to take him on.\nMark understood this much, anyway: that he might really have to fight this person. He didn\u2019t want to, but then again, he wouldn\u2019t have minded fighting him all that much.\nBut then Kerouac sat back down in his chair heavily, shaking his head and saying over and over again, \u201cDoesn\u2019t understand me at all.\u201d\nLater on that night, after Kerouac and Boles left, Mark and I talked some about Kerouac, who was then completing his seventeenth and last book.
