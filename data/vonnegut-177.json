Plainly, he wanted the stranger to go away again.\nThe stranger kept his hand extended, prayed to God for the right thing to say. He himself would lose the will to live if he abandoned Sweeny like this.\nHis prayer was answered. He became radiant even before he spoke, he was so sure his words were going to be the right ones. One regret, at least, was going to be wiped off the slate.\nThe stranger raised his proferred hand to a position of solemn oath. \u201cMr. Sweeny,\u201d he said, \u201cI give you my solemn word of honor that I have two kiddleys. If you have one kiddley, that makes three kiddleys between us.\u201d\nHe handed Sweeny a dime. \u201cSo you win, Mr. Sweeny.\u201d\nSweeny was restored to health instantly. He jumped up, shook the stranger\u2019s hand. \u201cI knowed you was a two-kiddley man by looking at you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be nothing but a two-kiddley man.\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know what got into me to pretend I was ever anything else,\u201d said the stranger.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Sweeny cheerfully, \u201cnobody likes to lose.\u201d He looked at the dime one last time before pocketing it. \u201cAnyways\u2014you got a lesson cheap.
