month or so. I assume you know how to get here, in case you want to come here. We\u2019d love to see you. Edith, who says we are always cutting up her friends, started cutting up our friends one night, but she had nothing but good things to say about you. [\u2026]\nI suppose I\u2019ve already crowed to you about this: Mark got into Swarthmore, and Steve got into Dartmouth, both first choices, in the toughest college entrance year in history. No scholarships.\nSo here I am at the male menopause, to all practical purposes complete. We filled out a very complicated scholarship application form for Swarthmore, had to account for every cent we had or might get, and Swarthmore wrote back that no scholarship was necessary. Mark was flabbergasted, and started investigating on his own to find out what I had hidden around, and Jane has stopped making poor mouths, though she will carry the lines made by them to the grave. I am rich.\nJane\u2019s father died at about 74 a couple of weeks back\u2014stroke, stroke, stroke, and then the old people\u2019s friend, pneumonia. He looked just like Gary Cooper, talked less. During our nearly 20 years of marriage, he sent us one postcard. When Jane took on all the Adams kids he said not a word. He had been half-way through Marine basic when the first World War ended, so the V.A. sent a flag over to the mortuary, and the Mr. Joyboys spread it on the casket. My mother-in-law made them take it off because that sort of thing was only for men who had given their lives for their country. She was right. There was a huge gangster floral piece at the head of the casket. Jane looked at the card afterwards, and learned that it had been sent by the Wabash Valley Quarter-Midget Racing Association. Wrong corpse.\nAs you may have noticed, the Times gave me two damn unfriendly reviews. They have since asked me to review in quick succession a new book by Duerrenmatt and the Tom Wolfe collection. Doing the Tom Wolfe thing properly (for the Times, the Times, for Chrissake!) is a ball-buster. If they are too chicken to have a staffer do it, then they should pay me a grand.\nI have started writing short stories again, in brand new ways. I\u2019m changing fast. The new ways are probably terrible. I can\u2019t judge.\nKurt\nJune 25, 1965\nWest Barnstable, MA", 0.04342300556586271], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["scrooched", 0.11216427022788346], ["alarm", 0.10040921793944461], ["straight", 0.06419378044871703], ["retainer", 0.06419378044871703], ["wrinkled", 0.06419378044871703], ["groom", 0.06419378044871703], ["corner", 0.058003473454699264], ["bride", 0.058003473454699264], ["cigar", 0.058003473454699264], ["standing", 0.053611380745511764], ["smoke", 0.04742107375149399], ["painting", 0.045067628257948064], ["knowing", 0.04123076675747621], ["picture", 0.03816709201759604], ["rheumy", 0.03738809007596115], ["spaced", 0.03738809007596115], ["flagrante", 0.03738809007596115], ["admission", 0.03738809007596115], ["scrotum", 0.03738809007596115], ["difference", 0.03738809007596115], ["beneath", 0.03738809007596115], ["absurdity", 0.03738809007596115], ["darling", 0.03738809007596115], ["15th", 0.03738809007596115], ["delicto", 0.03738809007596115], ["loudest", 0.03738809007596115], ["smoldering", 0.03738809007596115], ["silent", 0.03738809007596115], ["dictu", 0.03738809007596115], ["fringe", 0.03738809007596115], ["scrooch", 0.03738809007596115], ["mirabile", 0.03738809007596115], ["potted", 0.03738809007596115], ["eponymous", 0.03738809007596115], ["squeaks", 0.03738809007596115], ["kissing", 0.03738809007596115], ["chaotic", 0.03738809007596115], ["obsessed", 0.03738809007596115], ["sotto", 0.03738809007596115], ["voce", 0.03738809007596115], ["womanizer", 0.03738809007596115], ["evenly", 0.03738809007596115], ["guy", 0.03343190227249926], ["psychotic", 0.032096890224358514], ["hates", 0.032096890224358514], ["mystery", 0.032096890224358514], ["din", 0.032096890224358514], ["saucer", 0.032096890224358514], ["jerks", 0.032096890224358514], ["virgin", 0.032096890224358514], ["bother", 0.032096890224358514], ["heartless", 0.032096890224358514], ["monica", 0.030648367054270938], ["preparing", 0.029001736727349632], ["palm", 0.029001736727349632], ["accord", 0.029001736727349632], ["yelling", 0.029001736727349632], ["guest", 0.029001736727349632], ["cares", 0.029001736727349632], ["december", 0.029001736727349632], ["ceremony", 0.029001736727349632], ["mouth", 0.029001736727349632], ["family", 0.02758469231439077], ["grateful", 0.026805690372755882], ["hanging", 0.026805690372755882], ["crying", 0.026805690372755882], ["frame", 0.026805690372755882], ["wheel", 0.026805690372755882], ["oil", 0.026805690372755882], ["bird", 0.025102304484861154], ["wall", 0.025102304484861154], ["male", 0.025102304484861154], ["responsible", 0.025102304484861154], ["poop", 0.025102304484861154], ["opportunity", 0.025102304484861154], ["wedding", 0.023710536875746997], ["minutes", 0.023710536875746997], ["hung", 0.022533814128974032], ["simply", 0.022533814128974032], ["exactly", 0.022533814128974032], ["lily", 0.021514490521153246], ["gallery", 0.021514490521153246], ["realized", 0.021514490521153246], ["fell", 0.019811104633258515], ["stuff", 0.01908354600879802], ["white", 0.01908354600879802], ["eyes", 0.01908354600879802], ["hit", 0.01908354600879802], ["turn", 0.01841933702414436], ["daughter", 0.017242614277371393], ["universe", 0.017242614277371393], ["live", 0.017242614277371393], ["men", 0.01622329066955061], ["women", 0.01622329066955061], ["left", 0.01622329066955061], ["find", 0.015760507296906073], ["twenty", 0.015760507296906073], ["ago", 0.015324183527135469], ["house", 0.014911456647209703], ["kicked", 0.014911456647209703], ["nice", 0.014911456647209703], ["will", 0.013595520835396035], ["day", 0.012517124136865872], ["woman", 0.011951414425768758], ["thought", 0.01168354175545372], ["academy", 0.011174447293631795], ["free", 0.009620256795607065], ["kilgore", 0.007997650368250784], ["years", 0.0061335514330443566], ["trout", 0.003937505078450609]], "sentiment": ["My darling daughter Lily will turn twenty-eight on December 15th! Who ever thought I would live to see that day?\nThe Wrinkled Old Family Retainer is about a wedding. The bride is Mirabile Dictu, a virgin. The groom is Flagrante Delicto, a heartless womanizer.\nSotto Voce, a male guest standing at the fringe of the ceremony, says out of the corner of his mouth to a guy standing next to him, \u201cI don\u2019t bother with all this. I simply find a woman who hates me, and I give her a house.\u201d\nAnd the other guy says, as the groom is kissing the bride, \u201cAll women are psychotic. All men are jerks.\u201d\nThe eponymous wrinkled old family retainer, crying his rheumy eyes out behind a potted palm, is Scrotum.\nMonica is still obsessed by the mystery of who left a cigar smoldering beneath the smoke alarm in the picture gallery of the Academy minutes before free will kicked in again. That was more than nine years ago! Who cares? What difference can knowing that make? That\u2019s like knowing what the white stuff in bird poop is.\nWhat Kilgore Trout did with that cigar was scrooch it out in the saucer.

terrible thing, then you have not understood a word I\u2019ve said.\u201d Now he closes his speech as he closes every speech\u2014with these words: \u201cFarewell, hello, farewell, hello.\u201d\nThere are police around him as he leaves the stage. They are there to protect him from the crush of popularity. No threats on his life have been made since 1945. The police offer to stay with him. They are floridly willing to stand in a circle around him all night, with their zap guns drawn.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d says Billy serenely. \u201cIt is time for you to go home to your wives and children, and it is time for me to be dead for a little while\u2014and then live again.\u201d At that moment, Billy\u2019s high forehead is in the cross hairs of a high-powered laser gun. It is aimed at him from the darkened press box. In the next moment, Billy Pilgrim is dead. So it goes.\nSo Billy experiences death for a while. It is simply violet light and a hum. There isn\u2019t anybody else there. Not even Billy Pilgrim is there.\nThen he swings back into life again, all the way back to an hour after his life was threatened by Lazzaro\u2014in 1945. He has been told to get out of his hospital bed and dress, that he is well. He and Lazzaro and poor old Edgar Derby are to join their fellows in the theater. There they will choose a leader for themselves by secret ballot in a free election.\nBilly and Lazzaro and poor old Edgar Derby crossed the prison yard to the theater now. Billy was carrying his little coat as though it were a lady\u2019s muff. It was wrapped around and around his hands. He was the central clown in an unconscious travesty of that famous oil painting, \u201cThe Spirit of \u201976.\u201d\nEdgar Derby was writing letters home in his head, telling his wife that he was alive and well, that she shouldn\u2019t worry, that the war was nearly over, that he would soon be home.\nLazzaro was talking to himself about people he was going to have killed after the war, and rackets he was going to work, and women he was going to make fuck him, whether they wanted to or not. If he had been a dog in a city, a policeman would have shot him and sent his head to a laboratory, to see if he had rabies. So it goes.\nAs they neared the theater, they came upon an Englishman who was hacking a groove in the Earth with the heel of his boot. He was marking the boundary between the American and English sections of the compound. Billy and Lazzaro and Derby didn\u2019t have to ask what the line meant. It was a familiar symbol from childhood.\nThe theater was paved with American bodies that nestled like spoons. Most of the Americans were in stupors or asleep. Their guts were fluttering, dry.", -0.010332355816226777], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["pain", 0.18639044253535617], ["writer", 0.1354914081471123], ["question", 0.08919000069314989], ["learn", 0.08498302377689554], ["subtler", 0.07883605896251528], ["items", 0.07883605896251528], ["pieces", 0.0752518611822996], ["stand", 0.07333083619813473], ["answers", 0.061258262343825524], ["unk", 0.056295699537049874], ["called", 0.054074520857536224], ["boaz", 0.05341302870834312], ["head", 0.04727251645841976], ["letter", 0.0455649942956379], ["fraction", 0.0449632069257372], ["misplaced", 0.0449632069257372], ["gladder", 0.0449632069257372], ["48", 0.0449632069257372], ["dismissed", 0.0449632069257372], ["progressed", 0.0449632069257372], ["early", 0.0449632069257372], ["matters", 0.0449632069257372], ["71", 0.0449632069257372], ["hurts", 0.0449632069257372], ["heroic", 0.0449632069257372], ["47", 0.0449632069257372], ["72", 0.0449632069257372], ["couldn", 0.04121405484789963], ["train", 0.03941802948125764], ["fighting", 0.03941802948125764], ["mistakes", 0.03617430861639232], ["invite", 0.03617430861639232], ["46", 0.03617430861639232], ["4", 0.03617430861639232], ["numerous", 0.03617430861639232], ["army", 0.03604968057169081], ["crying", 0.033872852036778076], ["5", 0.033872852036778076], ["furnace", 0.033872852036778076], ["knowledge", 0.033872852036778076], ["faith", 0.033872852036778076], ["break", 0.033872852036778076], ["explained", 0.032087703626264404], ["fourth", 0.032087703626264404], ["start", 0.030629131171912762], ["crossed", 0.030629131171912762], ["turning", 0.029395925733294692], ["alive", 0.028327674592298516], ["plans", 0.028327674592298516], ["grew", 0.028327674592298516], ["sweet", 0.027385410307047445], ["kill", 0.027385410307047445], ["afraid", 0.027385410307047445], ["laid", 0.027385410307047445], ["answer", 0.027385410307047445], ["hurt", 0.027385410307047445], ["game", 0.026542526181784834], ["things", 0.025237593566121597], ["questions", 0.0250839537274332], ["barrack", 0.0250839537274332], ["people", 0.02495932568273169], ["antenna", 0.02385074828881513], ["won", 0.02329880531691952], ["moment", 0.022297500173287473], ["empty", 0.022297500173287473], ["turn", 0.021840232862567886], ["supposed", 0.021840232862567886], ["asked", 0.021407695092405678], ["watch", 0.019879253198304005], ["pocket", 0.018898434621565343], ["stood", 0.018305570844335567], ["love", 0.018024840285845407], ["felt", 0.018024840285845407], ["friend", 0.018024840285845407], ["room", 0.017753627872439958], ["big", 0.016075863624583405], ["knew", 0.015862517647926115], ["place", 0.01565471375670003], ["hand", 0.015061849979470254], ["will", 0.014162026112056731], ["thing", 0.01207621601235071], ["going", 0.010317340203446553], ["earth", 0.010109536312220467], ["good", 0.009328428555709138]], "sentiment": ["The fourth was, (4.)

become if the first settlers on Santa Rosalia had been the original passenger list and crew for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d\u2014Captain von Kleist, surely, and Hisako Hiroguchi and Selena MacIntosh and Mary Hepburn, and, instead of the Kanka-bono girls, the sailors and officers and Jacqueline Onassis and Dr. Henry Kissinger and Rudolf Nureyev and Mick Jagger and Paloma Picasso and Walter Cronkite and Bobby King and Robert P\u00e9pin, \u201cthe greatest chef in France,\u201d and, of course, Andrew MacIntosh and Zenji Hiroguchi, and on and on.\nThe island could have supported that many individuals\u2014just barely. There would have been some struggles, some fights, I guess\u2014some killings, even, if food or water ran short. And I suppose some of them would have imagined that Nature or something was very pleased if they emerged victorious. But their survival wouldn\u2019t have amounted to a hill of beans, as far as evolution was concerned, if they didn\u2019t reproduce, and most of the women on the passenger list were past child-bearing age, and so not worth fighting for.\nDuring the first thirteen years on Santa Rosalia, before Akiko reached puberty, in fact, the only fertile women would have been Selena, who was blind, and Hisako Hiroguchi, who had already given birth to a baby all covered with fur, and three others who were normal. And probably all of them would have been impregnated by victors, even against their will. But in the long run, I don\u2019t think it would have made much difference which males did the impregnating, Mick Jagger or Dr. Henry Kissinger or the Captain or the cabin boy. Humanity would still be pretty much what it is today.\nIn the long run, the survivors would still have been not the most ferocious strugglers but the most efficient fisherfolk. That\u2019s how things work in the islands here.\nThere were live Maine lobsters who also came within a hair of having their survival skills tested by the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago. Before the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was looted, there were two hundred of them in aerated tanks of saltwater in the hold.\nThe waters around Santa Rosalia were surely cold enough for them, but perhaps too deep. There was this about them, at any rate: They were like human beings in that they could eat almost anything, if they had to.\nAnd Captain von Kleist, when he was an old, old man, remembered those lobsters in their tanks. The older he became, the more vivid were his recollections of events of the long ago. And after supper one night, he amused Akiko, the furry daughter of Hisako Hiroguchi, with a science-fiction fantasy whose premise was that the Maine lobsters had made it to the islands, and that a million years had passed, as they have indeed passed now\u2014and that lobsters had become the dominant species on the planet, and had built cities and theaters and hospitals and public transportation and so on. He had lobsters playing violins and solving murders and performing microsurgery and subscribing to book clubs and so on.\nThe moral of the story was that the lobsters were doing exactly what human beings had done, which was to make a mess of everything. They all wished that they could just be ordinary lobsters, particularly since there were no longer human beings around who wanted to boil them alive.\nThat was all they had had to complain about in the first place: being boiled alive. Now, just because they hadn\u2019t wanted to be boiled alive anymore, they had to support symphony orchestras, and on and on. The viewpoint character in the Captain\u2019s story was the underpaid second chair French horn player in the Lobsterville Symphony Orchestra who had just lost his wife to a professional ice hockey

painting of mine, from the one Gregory incinerated to the last one I will ever do, and if these were to be hung in a great domed rotunda so as to concentrate the soul in each one at the same focal point, and if my own mother and the women who swore they loved me, which would be Marilee and Dorothy and Edith, were to stand for hours at that focal point, along with the best friend I ever had, who was Terry Kitchen, not one of them would find any reason to think about me except randomly. There would not be a trace of their dear departed Rabo Karabekian, or of spiritual energy of any sort, at the focal point!\nWhat an experiment!\nOh, I know: I bad-mouthed Gregory\u2019s works a while back, saying he was a taxidermist, and that his pictures were always about a single moment rather than the flow of life, and so on. But he was sure a better painter than I could ever hope to be. Nobody could put more of the excitement of a single moment into the eyes of stuffed animals, so to speak, than Dan Gregory.\nCirce Berman has just asked me how to tell a good picture from a bad one.\nI said that the best answer I had ever heard to that question, although imperfect, came from a painter named Syd Solomon, a man about my age who summers not far from here. I overheard him say it to a very pretty girl at a cocktail party maybe fifteen years ago. She was so wide-eyed and on tippy-toe! She sure wanted to learn all about art from him.\n\u201cHow can you tell a good painting from a bad one?\u201d he said. This is the son of a Hungarian horse trainer. He has a magnificent handlebar mustache.\n\u201cAll you have to do, my dear,\u201d he said, \u201cis look at a million paintings, and then you can never be mistaken.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true!

The voice seemed intent on shattering any illusions passengers might have of their destinations\u2019 being better than what they were leaving. San Francisco was droned as cheerlessly as Troy; Miami sounded no more seductive than Knoxville.\nThunder rolled across the ceiling of the waiting room. The pillar by Ruth trembled. She looked up from her magazine to the station clock. Her train would be next, southbound.\nWhen she bought her ticket, checked her baggage through, and settled on a hard bench to read away the dead minutes, her movements had been purposeful, quick, her walk almost a swagger. The motions had been an accompaniment to a savage dialogue buzzing in her head. In her imagination she had lashed out at Mrs. Faulkner with merciless truths, had triumphantly wrung from that rook of a woman apologies and tears.\nFor the moment, the vengeful fantasy left Ruth satisfied, forgetful of her recent tormentor. She felt only boredom and incipient loneliness. To dispel these two, she looked from group to group in the waiting room, reading in faces and clothes and luggage the commonplace narratives that had brought each person to the station.\nA tall, baby-faced private chatted stiffly with his well-dressed mother and father: yanked out of gray flannels and college by the draft \u2026 nothing but a marksman\u2019s medal \u2026 bright, lots of money \u2026 father uncomfortable about son\u2019s rank and overparking \u2026\nA racking cough cut into Ruth\u2019s thoughts. An old man, cramped against the armrest at the end of a completely vacant bench, was doubled by a coughing fit.

Dangling at the end of it was a battered sample case. Clewes had become an unsuccessful salesman, as I would find out later, of advertising matchbooks and calendars.\nHe is nowadays, incidentally, a vice-president in the Diamond Match Division of The RAMJAC Corporation.\nIn spite of all that had happened to him, though, his face, as he came toward me, was illuminated as always with an adolescent, goofy good will. He had worn that expression even in a photograph of his entering prison in Georgia, with the warden looking up at him as the secretary of state used to do.

I might as well have stuck my nose into a lamp socket!\nI went right past him and in the opposite direction. I had nothing to say to him, and no wish to stand and listen to all the terrible things he was entitled to say to me.\nWhen I gained the curb, though, and the lights changed, and we were separated by moving cars, I dared to look back at him.\nClewes was facing me. Plainly, he had not yet come up with a name for me. He pointed at me with his free hand, indicating that he knew I had figured in his life in some way. And then he made that finger twitch like a metronome, ticking off possible names for me. This was fun for him. His feet were apart, his knees were bent, and his expression said that he remembered this much, anyway: We had been involved years ago in some sort of wildness, in a boyish prank of some kind.\nI was hypnotized.", 0.10124716553287982], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["scholarly", 0.21075405386385407], ["citizenship", 0.12338795737689172], ["book", 0.11627759040455188], ["sort", 0.1017007583391711], ["minton", 0.09627100003576831], ["written", 0.07534079320268645], ["allegiance", 0.07025135128795136], ["declares", 0.07025135128795136], ["loses", 0.07025135128795136], ["employment", 0.07025135128795136], ["citizen", 0.07025135128795136], ["altruist", 0.07025135128795136], ["uncle", 0.07025135128795136], ["weighed", 0.07025135128795136], ["accepts", 0.07025135128795136], ["serves", 0.07025135128795136], ["read", 0.062032237629039866], ["sam", 0.06169397868844586], ["lead", 0.06169397868844586], ["international", 0.06169397868844586], ["forces", 0.06169397868844586], ["inviting", 0.06169397868844586], ["title", 0.06169397868844586], ["son", 0.060055874476606874], ["lorenzo", 0.057897224788109956], ["copies", 0.05668823661303643], ["romance", 0.05668823661303643], ["passport", 0.05668823661303643], ["published", 0.05668823661303643], ["foreign", 0.05668823661303643], ["san", 0.05393529443432595], ["handed", 0.05313660608894037], ["state", 0.05313660608894037], ["led", 0.05313660608894037], ["armed", 0.05313660608894037], ["manuscript", 0.05038174743074024], ["keeping", 0.05038174743074024], ["author", 0.04813086401353092], ["claire", 0.04622776920084873], ["echoed", 0.044579233489434864], ["chicken", 0.04312512193812149], ["government", 0.04312512193812149], ["opened", 0.04312512193812149], ["land", 0.041824374831234745], ["reading", 0.0406477059447616], ["history", 0.0406477059447616], ["states", 0.039573491414025434], ["paper", 0.039573491414025434], ["hotel", 0.039573491414025434], ["funny", 0.03858530983780893], ["united", 0.03858530983780893], ["castle", 0.03781423138183675], ["mother", 0.03326700223172925], ["julian", 0.0326646545259338], ["philip", 0.0320903333452561], ["great", 0.03154154615302359], ["hands", 0.031016118814519933], ["wife", 0.031016118814519933], ["things", 0.022458746215014435], ["good", 0.017453004139605], ["people", 0.0154038049115277], ["frank", 0.014426800954012593]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThat\u2019s all been written off,\u201d said Minton. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a United States citizen any more, and he seems to be doing good things where he is, so that\u2019s that.\u201d\n\u201cHe gave up his citizenship?\u201d\n\u201cAnybody who declares allegiance to a foreign state or serves in its armed forces or accepts employment in its government loses his citizenship.

He could slip it over the end of his real penis, according to the ad, and thrill his wife or sweetheart with extra inches. They also wanted to sell him a lifelike rubber vagina for when he was lonesome.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDwayne went back to work at about two in the afternoon, and he avoided everybody\u2014because of his echolalia. He went into his inner office, and he ransacked his desk drawers for something to read or think about. He came across the brochure which offered him the penis-extender and the rubber vagina for lonesomeness. He had received it two months before. He still hadn\u2019t thrown it away.\nThe brochure also offered him motion pictures such as the ones Kilgore Trout had seen in New York. There were still photographs taken from the movies, and these caused the sex excitation center in Dwayne\u2019s brain to send nerve impulses down to an erection center in his spine.\nThe erection center caused the dorsal vein in his penis to tighten up, so blood could get in all right, but it couldn\u2019t get out again. It also relaxed the tiny arteries in his penis, so they filled up the spongy tissue of which Dwayne\u2019s penis was mainly composed, so that the penis got hard and stiff\u2014like a plugged-up garden hose.\nSo Dwayne called Francine Pefko on the telephone, even though she was only eleven feet away. \u201cFrancine\u2014?\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes?\u201d she said.\nDwayne fought down his echolalia. \u201cI am going to ask you to do something I have never asked you to do before.
