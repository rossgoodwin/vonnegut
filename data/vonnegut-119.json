I want you to adore the Universe, to be easily delighted, but to be prompt as well with impatience with those artists who offend your own deep notions of what the Universe is or should be. \u201cThis above all \u2026\u201d\nI invite you to read the fifteen tales in Masters of the Modern Short Story (W. Havighurst, editor, 1955, Harcourt, Brace, $14.95 in paperback). Read them for pleasure and satisfaction, beginning each as though, only seven minutes before, you had swallowed two ounces of very good booze. \u201cExcept ye be as little children \u2026\u201d\nThen reproduce on a single sheet of clean, white paper the table of contents of the book, omitting the page numbers, and substituting for each number a grade from A to F. The grades should be childishly selfish and impudent measures of your own joy or lack of it. I don\u2019t care what grades you give. I do insist that you like some stories better than others.\nProceed next to the hallucination that you are a minor but useful editor on a good literary magazine not connected with a university. Take three stories that please you most and three that please you least, six in all, and pretend that they have been offered for publication. Write a report on each to be submitted to a wise, respected, witty and world-weary superior.\nDo not do so as an academic critic, nor as a person drunk on art, nor as a barbarian in the literary market place. Do so as a sensitive person who has a few practical hunches about how stories can succeed or fail. Praise or damn as you please, but do so rather flatly, pragmatically, with cunning attention to annoying or gratifying details. Be yourself. Be unique. Be a good editor. The Universe needs more good editors, God knows.\nSince there are eighty of you, and since I do not wish to go blind or kill somebody, about twenty pages from each of you should do neatly. Do not bubble. Do not spin your wheels.

dinner. Every day, though, she hangs new dingle-dangles from her ears and around her neck. Sometimes her hair is up, sometimes it\u2019s down. Sometimes it\u2019s frizzy, sometimes it\u2019s straight. What she can\u2019t do with just her eyes and lips! One day I\u2019m buying a stamp from Count Dracula\u2019s daughter! The next day she\u2019s the Virgin Mary.\nThis time she\u2019s Ingrid Bergman in Stromboli. But she is a long way off still. There are many addled old poops, no good at counting money anymore, and immigrants talking gibberish, maddeningly imagining it to be English, in line ahead of me.\nOne time I had my pocket picked in that Postal Convenience Center. Convenient for whom?\nI put the waiting time to good use. I learn about stupid bosses and jobs I will never have, and about parts of the world I will never see, and about diseases I hope I will never have, and about different kinds of dogs people have owned, and so on. By means of a computer? No. I do it by means of the lost art of conversation.\nI at last have my envelope weighed and stamped by the only woman in the whole wide world who could make me sincerely happy. With her I wouldn\u2019t have to fake it.\nI go home. I have had one heck of a good time. Listen: We are here on Earth to fart around. Don\u2019t let anybody tell you any different!\n58\nI have taught creative writing during my seventy-three years on automatic pilot, rerun or not. I did it first at the University of Iowa in 1965. After that came Harvard, and then the City College of New York. I don\u2019t do it anymore.\nI taught how to be sociable with ink on paper. I told my students that when they were writing they should be good dates on blind dates, should show strangers good times. Alternatively, they should run really nice whore-houses, come one, come all, although they were in fact working in perfect solitude.

hoarsely. \"Come on, you guys\u2014let\u2019s kill him!\"\nUnk\u2019s mate, the mother of young Chrono, was an instructress in the Schliemann Breathing School for Recruits. Schliemann breathing, of course, is a technique that enables human beings to survive in a vacuum or in an inhospitable atmosphere without the use of helmets or other cumbersome respiratory gear.\nIt consists, essentially, of taking a pill rich in oxygen. The bloodstream takes on this oxygen through the wall of the small intestine rather than through the lungs. On Mars, the pills were known officially as Combat Respiratory Rations, in popular parlance as goofballs.\nSchliemann breathing is at its simplest in a benign but useless atmosphere like that of Mars. The breather goes on breathing and talking in a normal manner, though there is no oxygen for his lungs to take in from the atmosphere. All he has to remember is to take his goofballs regularly.\nThe school in which Unk\u2019s mate was an instructress taught recruits the more difficult techniques necessary in a vacuum or in a harmful atmosphere. This involves not only pill-taking, but plugging one\u2019s ears and nostrils, and keeping one\u2019s mouth shut as well. Any effort to speak or to breathe would result in hemorrhages and probably death.\nUnk\u2019s mate was one of six instructresses at the Schliemann Breathing School for Recruits. Her classroom was a bare, windowless, whitewashed room, thirty feet square. Ranged around the walls were benches.\nOn a table in the middle was a bowl of goofballs, a bowl of nose and ear plugs, a roll of adhesive plaster, scissors, and a small tape recorder. Purpose of the tape recorder was to play music during the long periods in which there was nothing to do but sit and wait patiently for nature to take its course.\nSuch a period had been reached now. The class had just been dosed with goofballs. Now the students had to sit quietly on the benches and listen to music and wait for the goofballs to reach their small intestines.\nThe tune being played had been pirated recently from an Earthling broadcast. It was a big hit on Earth\u2014a trio composed for a boy, a girl, and cathedral bells. It was called \"God Is Our Interior Decorator.\" The boy and girl sang alternate lines of the verses, and joined in close harmony on the choruses.\nThe cathedral bells whanged and clanged whenever anything of a religious nature was mentioned.", 0.013392857142857142], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["mudbank", 0.09423483370734426], ["twin", 0.0815165368163361], ["neighborhood", 0.05607994303431974], ["wave", 0.053918786416771426], ["satisfied", 0.04711741685367213], ["splattering", 0.04711741685367213], ["fires", 0.04711741685367213], ["shallows", 0.04711741685367213], ["jazzy", 0.04711741685367213], ["1533", 0.04711741685367213], ["montaigne", 0.04711741685367213], ["propellers", 0.04711741685367213], ["1592", 0.04711741685367213], ["eyquem", 0.04711741685367213], ["prosperity", 0.04711741685367213], ["steered", 0.04711741685367213], ["detonation", 0.04711741685367213], ["higher", 0.04711741685367213], ["importantly", 0.04711741685367213], ["feasting", 0.04711741685367213], ["michel", 0.04711741685367213], ["kilometer", 0.04075826840816805], ["upstream", 0.04075826840816805], ["snapped", 0.04075826840816805], ["glacco", 0.04075826840816805], ["dynamite", 0.04075826840816805], ["experienced", 0.04075826840816805], ["moonlight", 0.04075826840816805], ["descendant", 0.03703840503102892], ["swept", 0.03703840503102892], ["darkness", 0.03703840503102892], ["diesel", 0.03703840503102892], ["cow", 0.03703840503102892], ["dagonite", 0.03703840503102892], ["drowned", 0.03703840503102892], ["illuminated", 0.03703840503102892], ["slid", 0.03703840503102892], ["gently", 0.03703840503102892], ["breaking", 0.03703840503102892], ["estuary", 0.03439911996266396], ["downstream", 0.03439911996266396], ["umbilical", 0.03439911996266396], ["flew", 0.03439911996266396], ["rats", 0.03439911996266396], ["noble", 0.03439911996266396], ["tied", 0.03439911996266396], ["direct", 0.0323519314184969], ["result", 0.0323519314184969], ["cord", 0.0323519314184969], ["tidal", 0.0323519314184969], ["nylon", 0.0323519314184969], ["forms", 0.030679256585524832], ["bringing", 0.030679256585524832], ["aground", 0.030679256585524832], ["engines", 0.030679256585524832], ["sick", 0.030679256585524832], ["left", 0.030078731662087733], ["engaged", 0.029265030165091275], ["wharf", 0.029265030165091275], ["explosion", 0.02803997151715987], ["die", 0.026959393208385713], ["suddenly", 0.026959393208385713], ["started", 0.026959393208385713], ["arrived", 0.02599278297299281], ["bridge", 0.02599278297299281], ["crew", 0.025118377653687074], ["meters", 0.025118377653687074], ["carried", 0.025118377653687074], ["son", 0.025118377653687074], ["waterfront", 0.025118377653687074], ["caused", 0.02432010814002075], ["free", 0.023585771372373623], ["moved", 0.023585771372373623], ["guayaquil", 0.023203622498025153], ["mainland", 0.022905881719587188], ["wonderful", 0.022905881719587188], ["bus", 0.022905881719587188], ["future", 0.022905881719587188], ["open", 0.022272919595853684], ["air", 0.021680823071655784], ["quoth", 0.020600244762881626], ["humankind", 0.019186018342448062], ["simply", 0.019186018342448062], ["ocean", 0.019186018342448062], ["lot", 0.01835141487267076], ["de", 0.018214013039609706], ["siegfried", 0.01796095969451666], ["white", 0.0165467332740831], ["will", 0.015612947087753355], ["wanted", 0.0153216746261517], ["high", 0.014499544729916039], ["kleist", 0.013989729581706765], ["captain", 0.013830675272961106], ["von", 0.01374506676443923], ["great", 0.01350675954973042], ["nature", 0.011601811249012576], ["mandarax", 0.010867474481365453], ["life", 0.010692720399065504], ["ship", 0.010521232940238419], ["bah", 0.00925379864224927], ["darwin", 0.0080102620184307]], "sentiment": ["They were simply moved suddenly from one neighborhood to another one.

ballroom dancing lessons being offered at the Elks Lodge in East Quogue.\nI said to her: \u201cI am not going to sacrifice my one remaining shred of dignity on the altar of Terpsichore.\u201d\nI experienced modest prosperity at Leidveld and Moore. It was there that I did my painting of the most beautiful ocean liner in the world, the Normandie. In the foreground was the most beautiful automobile in the world, the Cord. In the background was the most beautiful skyscraper in the world, the Chrysler Building. Getting out of the Cord was the most beautiful actress in the world, who was Madeleine Carroll. What a time to be alive!\nImproved diet and sleeping conditions did me the disservice of sending me one evening to the Art Students League with a portfolio under my arm. I wished to take lessons in how to be a serious painter, and presented myself and my work to a teacher named Nelson Bauerbeck, a representational painter, as were almost all of the painting teachers then. He was principally known as a portraitist, and his work can still be viewed in at least one place I know of\u2014at New York University, my old alma mater. He did portraits of two of that institution\u2019s presidents before my time. He made them immortal, as only paintings can.\nThere were about twelve students in the room and busy at their easels, all making pictures of the same nude model. I looked forward to joining them. They seemed to be a happy family, and I needed one. I was not a member of the family at Leidveld and Moore. There was resentment there about how I\u2019d got my job.\nBauerbeck was old to be teaching\u2014about sixty-five, I\u2019d guess. I knew from the head of the art department at the ad agency, who had studied under him, that he was a native of Cincinnati, Ohio, but had spent most of his adult life in Europe, as so many American painters used to do. He was so old that he had conversed, however briefly, with James Whistler and Henry James and Emile Zola and Paul Cezanne! He also claimed to have been a friend of Hitler in Vienna, when Hitler was a starving artist before the First World War.\nOld Bauerbeck must have himself been a starving artist when I met him. Otherwise, he would not have been teaching at the Art Students League at that advanced age. I have never been able to find out what finally became of him. Now you see him, now you don\u2019t.\nWe did not become friends. He leafed through my portfolio while saying things like this, very quietly, thank God, so his students could not hear: \u201cOh, dear, dear, dear,\u201d and \u201cMy poor boy,\u201d and \u201cWho did this to you\u2014or did you do it to yourself?\u201d\nI asked him what on Earth was wrong, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can put it into words.\u201d He really did have to think hard about it. \u201cThis is going to sound very odd\u2014\u201d he said at last, \u201cbut, technically speaking, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do.

My hair may turn white before this very short speech is done.\n\u201cI now quote a previous owner of this house: \u2019When I find a well-drawn character in fiction or biography, I generally take a warm personal interest in him, for the reason that I have known him before\u2014met him on the river.\u2019\n\u201cI submit to you that this is a profoundly Christian statement, an echo of the Beatitudes. It is constructed, as many jokes are, incidentally, with a disarmingly pedestrian beginning and an unexpectedly provoking conclusion.\n\u201cI will repeat it, for we are surely here to repeat ourselves. Lovers do almost nothing but repeat themselves.\n\u201c\u2019When I find a well-drawn character in fiction or biography, I generally take a warm personal interest in him, for the reason that I have known him before\u2014met him on the river.\u2019\n\u201cThree words, in my opinion, make this a holy joke. They are \u2019warm\u2019 and \u2019personal\u2019 and \u2019river.\u2019 The river, of course, is life\u2014and not just to river pilots but even to desert people, to people who have never even seen water in that long and narrow form. Mark Twain is saying what Christ said in so many ways: that he could not help loving anyone in the midst of life.\n\u201cI am of course a skeptic about the divinity of Christ and a scorner of the notion that there is a God who cares how we are or what we do. I was raised this way\u2014in the midst of what provincial easterners imagine to be a Bible Belt. I was confirmed in my skepticism by Mark Twain during my formative years, and by some other good people, too. I have since bequeathed this lack of faith and my love for the body of literature which supports it to my children.\n\u201cI am moved on this occasion to put into a few words the ideal my parents and Twain and the rest held before me, and which I have now passed on. The ideal, achieved by few, is this: \u2019Live so that you can say to God on Judgment Day, \u201cI was a very good person, even though I did not believe in you.\u201d \u2019 The word \u2019God,\u2019 incidentally, is capitalized throughout this speech, as are all pronouns referring to Him.\n\u201cWe religious skeptics would like to swagger some in heaven, saying to others who spent a lot of time quaking in churches down here, \u2019I was never worried about pleasing or angering God\u2014never took Him into my calculations at all.\u2019", 0.22042592592592594], "title": "Palm Sunday"},

figures. Realistically, the searchers didn\u2019t have much of a chance. They made a lot of noise, and went only where they thought it would be pleasant or interesting to go. The thief, who was apparently a nut, would have had little trouble keeping his peculiar loot out of sight.\nBut the searchers were so caught up in the allegory of what they were doing that a powerful expectation grew of its own accord, with no help from the paper. Everyone was convinced that the holy family would be found on Christmas Eve.\nBut on that eve, no new star shone over the city save the five-hundred-watt lamp hung from a balloon over the mansion of J. Sprague Fleetwood, alias Mad Dog Gribbon, the victim of the theft.\nThe mayor, the president of a big manufacturing company, and the chairman of the Real Estate Board rode in the back seat of the mayor\u2019s limousine, while Hackleman and I sat on the jump seats in front of them. We were on our way to award the first-prize scroll to Gribbon, who had replaced the missing figures with new ones.\n\u201cTurn down this street here?\u201d said the chauffeur.\n\u201cJust follow the star,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a light, a goddamn electric light that anybody can hang over his house if he\u2019s got the money,\u201d said Hackleman.\n\u201cFollow the goddamn electric light,\u201d I said.\nGribbon was waiting for us, wearing a tuxedo, and he opened the car door himself. \u201cGentlemen\u2014Merry Christmas.\u201d His eyes down, his hands folded piously across his round belly, he led us down a path, bounded by ropes, that led around the display and back to the street again. He passed by the corner of the mansion, just short of the point where we would be able to see the display. \u201cI like to think of it as a shrine,\u201d he said, \u201cwith people coming from miles around, following the stars.\u201d He stepped aside, motioning us to go ahead.\nAnd the dumbfounding panorama dazzled us again, looking like an outdoor class in calisthenics, with expressionless figures bobbing, waving their arms, flapping their wings.", 0.09346285434995111], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["heaven", 0.18953276840028313], ["lemonade", 0.1710743518728734], ["waiting", 0.13563524578680533], ["mommy", 0.0855371759364367], ["lightly", 0.0855371759364367], ["lukewarm", 0.0855371759364367], ["fairways", 0.0855371759364367], ["ocean", 0.0855371759364367], ["wanting", 0.0855371759364367], ["twitted", 0.0855371759364367], ["greens", 0.0855371759364367], ["hawaii", 0.0855371759364367], ["daddy", 0.0855371759364367], ["people", 0.08244859466605978], ["dead", 0.0796803730323503], ["golf", 0.07435738270159888], ["sounds", 0.07435738270159888], ["afraid", 0.07435738270159888], ["assumed", 0.07435738270159888], ["sold", 0.07435738270159888], ["manicured", 0.07435738270159888], ["feeble", 0.07435738270159888], ["sounded", 0.07435738270159888], ["subject", 0.06781762289340267], ["described", 0.06781762289340267], ["fifty", 0.06781762289340267], ["talked", 0.06317758946676104], ["deal", 0.06317758946676104], ["paradise", 0.06317758946676104], ["open", 0.06317758946676104], ["woke", 0.06317758946676104], ["moved", 0.059578499929435084], ["running", 0.059578499929435084], ["drink", 0.059578499929435084], ["morning", 0.05199779623192322], ["arms", 0.05199779623192322], ["mother", 0.04900371852067144], ["turtle", 0.048398706694597254], ["bay", 0.04686144573001137], ["lot", 0.04545803642372702], ["vermont", 0.04416702500963773], ["place", 0.04416702500963773], ["replied", 0.04297173513619059], ["turned", 0.04185894688640106], ["knew", 0.04081800299708539], ["sort", 0.03891827661553082], ["find", 0.0364319753279944], ["love", 0.03427824318888919], ["years", 0.03067915365156323], ["house", 0.029141892686977346], ["course", 0.029141892686977346], ["father", 0.029141892686977346], ["good", 0.028660393281337324]], "sentiment": ["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI woke up one morning to find that I was almost fifty years old!

He was a General.\nThe sermon was based on what he claimed was a well-known fact, that there were no Atheists in foxholes.\nI asked Jack what he thought of the sermon afterward, and he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a Chaplain who never visited the front.\u201d\nTHE MORTICIAN, WHO is himself now in a covered trench by the stable, was Norman Updike, a descendant of the valley\u2019s early Dutch settlers. He went on to tell me with bow-wow cheerfulness back in 1987 that people were generally mistaken about how quickly things rot, turn into good old dirt or fertilizer or dust or whatever. He said scientists had discovered well-preserved meat and vegetables deep in city dumps, thrown away presumably years and years ago. Like Hermann and Sophia Shultz, these theoretically biodegradable works of Nature had failed to rot for want of moisture, which was life itself to worms and fungi and bacteria.\n\u201cEven without modern embalming techniques,\u201d he said, \u201cashes to ashes and dust takes much, much longer than most people realize.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraged,\u201d I said.\nI DID NOT see Pamela Ford Hall by the stable until it was too late for me to head off in the opposite direction. I was distracted from watching out for her and Zuzu by a parent who had fled the bagpipe music on the Quadrangle. He commented that I seemed very depressed about something.\nI still hadn\u2019t told anybody I had been fired, and I certainly didn\u2019t want to share the news with a stranger. So I said I couldn\u2019t help being unhappy about the ice caps and the deserts and the busted economy and the race riots and so on.\nHe told me to cheer up, that 1,000,000,000 Chinese were about to throw off the yoke of Communism.

And the water from the taps of Midland City was becoming more poisonous every day. He ate very little. He prepared his own food in his room. The preparation was simple, since vegetables and fruits were all he ate, and he munched them raw.\nHe not only did without dead meat\u2014he did without living meat, too, without friends or lovers or pets. He had once been highly popular. When he was at Prairie Military Academy, for instance, the student body was unanimous in electing him Cadet Colonel, the highest rank possible, in his senior year.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen Bunny played the piano bar at the Holiday Inn, he had many, many secrets. One of them was this: he wasn\u2019t really there. He was able to absent himself from the cocktail lounge, and from the planet itself, for that matter, by means of Transcendental Meditation. He learned this technique from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who once stopped off in Midland City during a world-wide lecture tour.\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi, in exchange for a new handkerchief, a piece of fruit, a bunch of flowers, and thirty-five dollars, taught Bunny to close his eyes, and to say this euphonious nonsense word to himself over and over again: \u201cAye-eeeeem, aye-eeeeem, aye-eeeeem.\u201d Bunny sat on the edge of his bed in the hotel room now, and he did it. \u201cAye-eeeeem, aye-eeeeem\u201d, he said to himself\u2014internally. The rhythm of the chant matched one syllable with each two beats in his heart. He closed his eyes. He became a skin diver in the depths of his mind. The depths were seldom used.\nHis heart slowed. His respiration nearly stopped. A single word floated by in the depths. It had somehow escaped from the busier parts of his mind. It wasn\u2019t connected to anything. It floated by lazily, a translucent, scarf-like fish. The word was untroubling. Here was the word: \u201cBlue.\u201d Here is what it looked like to Bunny Hoover:\nAnd then another lovely scarf swam by. It looked like this:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFifteen minutes later, Bunny\u2019s awareness bobbed to the surface of its own accord. Bunny was refreshed. He got up from the bed, and he brushed his hair with the military brushes his mother had given him when he was elected Cadet Colonel so long ago.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.11260799385799383], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["rough", 0.11709794974520599], ["tells", 0.11709794974520599], ["understands", 0.11709794974520599], ["sir", 0.09420331238017011], ["person", 0.08061392537169278], ["eagle", 0.08061392537169278], ["distracted", 0.07519461560999859], ["bulldoze", 0.07519461560999859], ["lousy", 0.07519461560999859], ["gutless", 0.07519461560999859], ["disk", 0.07519461560999859], ["wonders", 0.07519461560999859], ["damn", 0.07266349311510215], ["quietly", 0.06469238560151457], ["flat", 0.06469238560151457], ["angrily", 0.06469238560151457], ["follow", 0.06469238560151457], ["dictator", 0.06469238560151457], ["pal", 0.06469238560151457], ["touched", 0.06469238560151457], ["engineers", 0.06469238560151457], ["insignia", 0.058548974872602993], ["tired", 0.058548974872602993], ["finishing", 0.058548974872602993], ["scouts", 0.058548974872602993], ["cap", 0.058548974872602993], ["softly", 0.058548974872602993], ["lost", 0.05813097553140861], ["swore", 0.05419015559303056], ["kicked", 0.05419015559303056], ["mess", 0.05419015559303056], ["cry", 0.05419015559303056], ["europe", 0.05080919269433041], ["fight", 0.04804674486411898], ["struck", 0.04804674486411898], ["lady", 0.04571112850309991], ["quiet", 0.04571112850309991], ["handed", 0.04368792558454653], ["shoulder", 0.04368792558454653], ["mine", 0.04368792558454653], ["trouble", 0.04368792558454653], ["pop", 0.041903334135207394], ["exactly", 0.041903334135207394], ["teeth", 0.041903334135207394], ["war", 0.04179774823647871], ["town", 0.03886286905244753], ["desk", 0.03318569557606252], ["young", 0.03318569557606252], ["russians", 0.03226714070005593], ["marta", 0.03226714070005593], ["turned", 0.030581903804446465], ["half", 0.029804732677362365], ["captain", 0.02582951654906705], ["head", 0.020898874118239354], ["day", 0.01892837217508484], ["going", 0.013936263067050867]], "sentiment": ["\u201cPop, I\u2019m going to tell you something that I want you to get through your head.
