The black eye is vanishing, and the stitches will come out next Monday. And now it\u2019s cold out, but I have a bed here, and a kitchen downstairs.\nMost of all, I have done all I could to keep Lily out of a lockdown, punishing school, where she can be put away, pretty much out of sight, until she\u2019s eighteen. And I got lucky, since Jill, providing an alternative scheme to Northampton as quickly as possible, discovered a great little private school in a townhouse only two blocks north of here\u2014The Beekman School. It is for good kids like Lily who have gotten into some sort of not-so-terrible teen-age trouble. There is heavy one-on-one tutoring. Ninety per cent of the graduates go on to college. There is now only one other kid in Lily\u2019s English class! And it isn\u2019t all that expensive, much cheaper than Cushing Academy. I had no idea such a sweet institution existed so close to home. Lily likes it a lot, and it likes Lily.\nI am living one day at a time, and have to, Jill is so volatile. A Christmas and New Year\u2019s vacation in a beachfront cottage on St. Barts was planned and paid for (no refunds) almost a year ago. There are three airplane tickets, and it is now understood that I will not use one of them, but that Lily can bring along a friend in my place. I pray this really happens. Jill, as punishment for some very slight offense, could easily cancel so as to sicken me and make Lily cry. Departure date is December 22.\nLove\u2014\nDAD\nDecember 10, 1999", 0.09478535353535351], "title": "Letters"}}
