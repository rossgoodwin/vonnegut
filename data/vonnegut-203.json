Just as the lightning had revealed for a split second the gray men and gouged mountainsides\u2014so had this talk suddenly revealed in a merciless flash the naked, frightened soul of his brother.

Peter tried to lose himself in contemplation of the fossil ant again. Involuntarily, his powerful fingers clamped down on the white chip. The chip and priceless ant snapped in two.
