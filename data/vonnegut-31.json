No lining, no stitching, no nothing special.\nI made this one myself. It could doubtless be improved upon by professionals.\nIt is rather flashy in color, don\u2019t you think?

He had told the scouts to wait while he went back for the college bastard. He passed under a low branch now. It hit the top of his helmet with a clonk. Weary didn\u2019t hear it. Somewhere a big dog was barking. Weary didn\u2019t hear that, either. His war story was at a very exciting point. An officer was congratulating the Three Musketeers, telling them that he was going to put them in for Bronze Stars.\n\u201cAnything else I can do for you boys?\u201d said the officer.\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said one of the scouts. \u201cWe\u2019d like to stick together for the rest of the war, sir. Is there some way you can fix it so nobody will ever break up the Three Musketeers?\u201d\nBilly Pilgrim had stopped in the forest. He was leaning against a tree with his eyes closed. His head was tilted back and his nostrils were flaring. He was like a poet in the Parthenon.\nThis was when Billy first came unstuck in time. His attention began to swing grandly through the full arc of his life, passing into death, which was violet light. There wasn\u2019t anybody else there, or any thing. There was just violet light\u2014and a hum.\nAnd then Billy swung into life again, going backwards until he was in pre-birth, which was red light and bubbling sounds. And then he swung into life again and stopped. He was a little boy taking a shower with his hairy father at Ilium Y.M.C.A. He smelled chlorine from the swimming pool next door, heard the springboard boom.\nLittle Billy was terrified, because his father had said Billy was going to learn to swim by the method of sink-or-swim. His father was going to throw Billy into the deep end, and Billy was going to damn well swim.\nIt was like an execution. Billy was numb as his father carried him from the shower room to the pool. His eyes were closed. When he opened his eyes, he was on the bottom of the pool, and there was beautiful music everywhere. He lost consciousness, but the music went on. He dimly sensed that somebody was rescuing him. Billy resented that.\nFrom there he traveled in time to 1965. He was forty-one years old, and he was visiting his decrepit mother at Pine Knoll, an old people\u2019s home he had put her in only a month before.

grateful for, *Zenji got a letter from *MacIntosh asking him a full ten months in advance to be his guest on his estate outside of M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, in Mexico, and then on the maiden voyage of an Ecuadorian luxury ship called the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, in whose financing he had had a hand.\n*MacIntosh had said in the letter in English, which had to be translated for *Zenji: Let us take this opportunity to get to really know each other.\nWhat he meant to get from *Zenji, probably in Yucat\u00e1n, or surely during \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century,\u201d was *Zenji\u2019s signature on an agreement to head a new corporation, whose stock *MacIntosh would merchandise.\nLike James Wait, *MacIntosh was a fisherman of sorts. He hoped to catch investors, using for bait not a price tag on his shirt but a Japanese computer genius.\nAnd now it appears to me that the tale I have to tell, spanning a million years, doesn\u2019t change all that much from beginning to end. In the beginning, as in the end, I find myself speaking of human beings, regardless of their brain size, as fisherfolk.\nSo it was November now, and the Hiroguchis were in Guayaquil. On the advice of *MacIntosh, *Zenji had lied to his employers about where he was going. He had led them to believe that he was exhausted by the creation of Mandarax, and that he and Hisako wished to have two months all by themselves, far from any reminders of work, and incommunicado. He put his piece of misinformation into their big brains: he had chartered schooner with crew, whose name he did not wish to reveal, sailing from a Mexican port whose name he did not wish to reveal, for a cruise through the islands of the Caribbean.\nAnd, although the passenger list for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d had been widely publicized, *Zenji\u2019s employers never learned that their most productive employee and his wife were also expected to be aboard. Like James Wait, they were traveling under false identities.\nAnd, again like James Wait, they had evanesced!\nAnybody looking for them would not be able to find them anywhere. Any big-brained search for them wouldn\u2019t even start on the correct continent.\n12", 0.050454545454545446], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["mission", 0.08052730786277268], ["rightful", 0.08052730786277268], ["article", 0.07341388491350663], ["sky", 0.06836683101084383], ["owners", 0.06836683101084383], ["letter", 0.05229155501305162], ["unimportant", 0.04634389235735077], ["dealt", 0.04634389235735077], ["fearing", 0.04634389235735077], ["publication", 0.04634389235735077], ["masterpieces", 0.04634389235735077], ["lawsuits", 0.04634389235735077], ["bridge", 0.04634389235735077], ["5", 0.04634389235735077], ["shaef", 0.04634389235735077], ["brooklyn", 0.04634389235735077], ["printed", 0.04634389235735077], ["response", 0.04634389235735077], ["hovanissian", 0.04634389235735077], ["barn", 0.04472854711268101], ["cheat", 0.04026365393138634], ["kevork", 0.04026365393138634], ["evaluate", 0.04026365393138634], ["unseen", 0.04026365393138634], ["catalogue", 0.04026365393138634], ["stated", 0.04026365393138634], ["offer", 0.04026365393138634], ["accurately", 0.04026365393138634], ["familiar", 0.04026365393138634], ["recognize", 0.04026365393138634], ["amusing", 0.04026365393138634], ["jokes", 0.036706942456753315], ["discover", 0.036706942456753315], ["sight", 0.036706942456753315], ["belief", 0.036706942456753315], ["auction", 0.036706942456753315], ["force", 0.036706942456753315], ["raise", 0.036706942456753315], ["workshop", 0.036706942456753315], ["editor", 0.036706942456753315], ["keeping", 0.036706942456753315], ["silly", 0.036706942456753315], ["knocked", 0.036706942456753315], ["claimed", 0.036706942456753315], ["turning", 0.034183415505421914], ["worthless", 0.034183415505421914], ["selling", 0.034183415505421914], ["art", 0.03310136942112735], ["paintings", 0.032442395162330565], ["served", 0.03222601593249024], ["christmas", 0.03222601593249024], ["loose", 0.03222601593249024], ["described", 0.03222601593249024], ["played", 0.03222601593249024], ["southampton", 0.03222601593249024], ["armenian", 0.03188540045505723], ["returned", 0.03062670403078889], ["market", 0.03062670403078889], ["air", 0.03062670403078889], ["evidently", 0.03062670403078889], ["captured", 0.029274505084935745], ["platoon", 0.029274505084935745], ["fellow", 0.029274505084935745], ["camouflage", 0.029274505084935745], ["man", 0.028381871298605848], ["stolen", 0.02810317707945748], ["big", 0.027114633516747724], ["artists", 0.02614577750652581], ["locked", 0.02614577750652581], ["longer", 0.02614577750652581], ["works", 0.025309723297715945], ["secret", 0.025309723297715945], ["expressionist", 0.024546465604824454], ["dollars", 0.024546465604824454], ["greatest", 0.023844336590144313], ["german", 0.023194266658971317], ["europe", 0.023194266658971317], ["brought", 0.022589066031892792], ["exactly", 0.022022938653493047], ["children", 0.020989754130191437], ["serious", 0.020989754130191437], ["wrong", 0.020515480259399546], ["inside", 0.020515480259399546], ["true", 0.02006553908056138], ["order", 0.02006553908056138], ["abstract", 0.019637555184338292], ["time", 0.01947128806494696], ["money", 0.01810813950762972], ["wouldn", 0.01776409816417988], ["knew", 0.013768698789769128], ["wasn", 0.012385988752895592], ["will", 0.012385988752895592], ["father", 0.011683859738215448], ["three", 0.011516770308647954], ["house", 0.01000060528374084], ["told", 0.009862461801564183], ["war", 0.008588935399419462]], "sentiment": ["\u201cAs for what\u2019s inside the barn,\u201d I tell them, \u201cit\u2019s the worthless secret of a silly old man, as the world will discover when I have gone to the big art auction in the sky.\u201d\n5\nONE ART PUBLICATION claimed to know exactly what was in there: the very greatest of the Abstract Expressionist paintings, which I was keeping off the market in order to raise the value of relatively unimportant paintings in the house here.\nNot true.\nAfter that article was printed, my fellow Armenian in Southampton, Kevork Hovanissian, made a serious offer of three million dollars for everything in the barn, sight unseen.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to cheat you that way,\u201d I told him. \u201cThat would be un-Armenian.\u201d\nIf I had taken his money, it would have been like selling him Brooklyn Bridge.\nOne response to that same article wasn\u2019t that amusing.

["As has already been said, my father\u2019s mother Nanette was cheerful and sociable, and uninterested in the fine arts save for music\u2014and my father\u2019s father Bernard was a freak in the family for being able to draw and paint so well at an early age. He was also unsociable, and evidently unhappy in Indianapolis most of the time.\nUncle John said to me in conversation one time that my grandfather Bernard was probably relieved to die young\u2014\u201cto be well out of it.\u201d He died of intestinal cancer at fifty-three, five years younger than I am now. That was in 1908, so he did not see any of his grandchildren. He did not even see his children married.\n\u201cLike his brothers,\u201d says Uncle John, \u201che attended the public schools, the German-English school, and then the Indianapolis High School then situated at Pennsylvania and Michigan Streets. Recognizing his talents as an artist, Alexander Metzger, a friend of his father, suggested that Bernard be given a higher education. He was then sent to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, where he studied architecture. He later studied in Hannover, Germany, and then worked as draftsman, for a couple of years, with a leading firm in New York.\n\u201cReturning to Indianapolis in 1883, he engaged in the practice of architecture, first in his own office and later with Arthur Bohn in what became the well-known firm of Vonnegut & Bohn, whose successors are in practice today. This firm designed and supervised construction of many fine residences and public buildings in Indianapolis, including the first Chamber of Commerce, the Athenaeum, the John Herron Art Museum, the L. S. Ayres store, the Fletcher Trust Building, and many others.\n\u201cHe read the poems of Heine with delight. He was highly cultivated in the arts, but his sympathies and inclinations were definitely Germanic. He and his family frequently lived abroad, and he sent his two sons to school in Strasbourg when they were quite young. He fathered three children: Kurt, born in 1884; Alex, in 1888; and then Irma, in 1890.\n\u201cAside from his attachment to his profession, Bernard took little participation in the social or civic life of the community. He confined his activities to the arts. His favorite clubs were the Portfolio and the Lyra Casino. The former was composed of painters, sculptors, architects, and writers. It held monthly dinners and discussions, and considered itself to be the custodian of the aesthetic conscience of the community. The Lyra Casino was a society of musicians, and gave private concerts of classical music. Bernard was an active participant in both these organizations, and his son Kurt likewise joined them in his maturity. Bernard\u2019s wife, Nanette, had a thorough training in and acquaintance with musical literature, but she did not share her husband\u2019s other interests.\n\u201cWhen their children attained an age to enable them to make objective judgment, they agreed that their parents\u2019 marriage was not a particularly congenial one. Kurt and Irma definitely identified with their father, while Alex identified with his mother. Unlike his brothers, Bernard was never robust physically. He suffered much with indigestion and headaches.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI, too, identify with this unhappy Bernard, although I am more or less robust and can say, knocking on wood, that I am seldom ill. I sleep well always. My digestion is good.\nThe family legend is that Bernard Vonnegut when a boy was working with his brothers in the family hardware store, and he began to weep. He was asked what the trouble was, and he said that he didn\u2019t want to work in a store. He said he wanted to be an artist instead.", 0.09014993686868683], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["petrie", 0.3457892725338701], ["boss", 0.3229458057639061], ["verne", 0.2972384909557], ["hit", 0.20929593294801105], ["advancement", 0.1845778089006179], ["sections", 0.1845778089006179], ["competing", 0.1845778089006179], ["executive", 0.16147290288195304], ["fields", 0.16147290288195304], ["organization", 0.16147290288195304], ["strike", 0.14795739927834756], ["junior", 0.14795739927834756], ["entirely", 0.14795739927834756], ["describe", 0.13836799686328818], ["level", 0.13836799686328818], ["wasn", 0.10970093126052732], ["wrong", 0.10174758724101787], ["listen", 0.0882320836374124], ["times", 0.0864298429284032], ["office", 0.08309372764317045], ["talk", 0.07471658003380692], ["head", 0.05768905924160723], ["good", 0.04066153844940754]], "sentiment": ["A: I hit him on the head with the part you talk and listen in.\nQ: How many times did you strike him with it?\nA: Once.

During the remaining 355 days of each year, Diana had the twenty-six rooms all to herself. She cleaned and cleaned and cleaned alone, without even the luxury of having someone to blame for making dirt.\nWhen Diana was through for the day, she would retire to a room over the Rosewater's six-car garage. The only vehicles in the garage were a 1936 Ford Phaeton, which was up on blocks, and a red tricycle with a fire bell hanging from the handlebars. The tricycle had belonged to Eliot as a child.\nAfter work, Diana would sit in her room and listen to her cracked green plastic radio, or she would fumble with her Bible. She could not read. Her Bible was a frazzled wreck. On the table beside her bed was a white telephone, a so-called Princess telephone, which she rented from the Indiana Bell Telephone Company for seventy-five cents a month, over and above ordinary service charges.\nThere was a thunderclap.\nDiana yelled for help. She should have yelled. Lightning had killed her mother and father at a Rosewater Lumber Company picnic in 1916. She was sure lightning was going to kill her, too. And, because her kidneys hurt all the time, she was sure the lightning would hit her in the kidneys.\nShe snatched her Princess phone from its cradle. She dialed the only number she ever dialed.

cheeks of her ass went\u2014\nHere the singers, in order to complete the stanza, were required to clap three times.\n2\nMY OFFICIAL TITLE in the Nixon White House, the job I was holding when I was arrested for embezzlement, perjury, and obstruction of justice, was this: the President\u2019s special advisor on youth affairs. I was paid thirty-six thousand dollars a year. I had an office, but no secretary, in the subbasement of the Executive Office Building, directly underneath, as it happened, the office where burglaries and other crimes on behalf of President Nixon were planned. I could hear people walking overhead and raising their voices sometimes. On my own level in the subbasement my only companions were heating and air-conditioning equipment and a Coca-Cola machine that only I knew about, I think. I was the only person to patronize that machine.\nYes, and I read college and high-school newspapers and magazines, and Rolling Stone and Crawdaddy, and anything else that claimed to speak for youth. I catalogued political statements in the words of popular songs. My chief qualification for the job, I thought, was that I myself had been a radical at Harvard, starting in my junior year. Nor had I been cochairman of the Harvard chapter of the Young Communist League. I had been cochairman of a radical weekly paper, The Bay State Progressive. I was in fact, openly and proudly, a card-carrying communist until Hitler and Stalin signed a nonaggression pact in Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-nine. Hell and heaven, as I saw it, were making common cause against weakly defended peoples everywhere. After that I became a cautious believer in capitalistic democracy again.\nIt was once so acceptable in this country to be a communist that my being one did not prevent my winning a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford after Harvard, and then landing a job in Roosevelt\u2019s Department of Agriculture after that. What could be so repulsive after all, during the Great Depression, especially, and with yet another war for natural wealth and markets coming, in a young man\u2019s belief that each person could work as well as he or she was able, and should be rewarded, sick or well, young or old, brave or frightened, talented or imbecilic, according to his or her simple needs? How could anyone treat me as a person with a diseased mind if I thought that war need never come again\u2014if only common people everywhere would take control of the planet\u2019s wealth, disband their national armies, and forget their national boundaries; if only they would think of themselves ever after as brothers and sisters, yes, and as mothers and fathers, too, and children of all other common people\u2014everywhere. The only person who would be excluded from such friendly and merciful society would be one who took more wealth than he or she needed at any time.\nAnd even now, at the rueful age of sixty-six, I find my knees still turn to water when I encounter anyone who still considers it a possibility that there will one day be one big happy peaceful family on Earth\u2014the Family of Man. If I were this very day to meet myself as I was in Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-three, I would swoon with pity and respectfulness.\nSo my idealism did not die even in the Nixon White House, did not die even in prison, did not die even when I became, my most recent employment, a vice-president of the Down Home Records Division of The RAMJAC Corporation.\nI still believe that peace and plenty and happiness can be worked out some way.

The judges hadn\u2019t had a look at us yet, and neither had any reporters. We hadn\u2019t yet put up the sign that said what my name was and what school system I represented. We hadn\u2019t yet said anything worth remembering.\nIf we had folded up and vanished quietly right then and there, leaving nothing but an empty table, we might have entered the history of American science as noshows who got sick or something. There was already an empty table, which would stay empty, only 5 meters away from ours. Father and I had heard that it was going to stay empty and why. The would-be exhibitor and his mother and father were all in the hospital in Lima, Ohio, not Lima, Peru. That was their hometown. They had scarcely backed out of their driveway the day before, headed for Cleveland, they thought, with the exhibit in the trunk, when they were rear-ended by a drunk driver.\nThe accident wouldn\u2019t have been half as serious as it turned out to be if the exhibit hadn\u2019t included several bottles of different acids which broke and touched off the gasoline. Both vehicles were immediately engulfed in flames.\nThe exhibit was, I think, meant to show several important services that acids, which most people were afraid of and didn\u2019t like to think much about, were performing every day for Humanity.\nTHE PEOPLE WHO looked us over and asked us questions, and did not like what they saw and heard, sent for a judge. They wanted us disqualified. We were worse than dishonest. We were ridiculous!\nI wanted to throw up. I said to Father, \u201cDad, honest to God, I think we better get out of here. We made a mistake.\u201d\nBut he said we had nothing to be ashamed of, and that we certainly weren\u2019t going to go home with our tails between our legs.\nVietnam!\nSo a judge did come over, and easily determined that I had no understanding whatsoever of the exhibit. He then took Father aside and negotiated a political settlement, man to man. He did not want to stir up bad feelings in our home county, which had sent me to Cleveland as its champion.
