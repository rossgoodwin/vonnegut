He didn\u2019t feel that he had been painting for the past five hours. He felt that he had been trying to rescue a cigar-store Indian from quicksand. The quicksand was the paint on Lazarro\u2019s canvas.\nLazarro had given up on pulling the Indian to the surface. He had let the Indian slip away at last to the Happy Hunting Ground.\nThe surface of the painting closed over the Indian, closed over Lazarro\u2019s self-respect, too. Life had called Lazarro\u2019s bluff, as he\u2019d always known it would.\nHe smiled like a racketeer, hoped to feel that he had gotten away with a very funny swindle for a good number of years. But he couldn\u2019t feel that way. He cared terribly about painting, wanted terribly to go on painting. If he was a racketeer, he was the racket\u2019s most pathetic victim, too.\nAs Lazarro dropped his clumsy hands into his lap, he thought of what the deft hands of Stedman must now be doing. If Stedman told those magical hands to be worldly, like Picasso\u2019s, they would be worldly. If he told those hands to be rigidly rectilinear, like Mondrian\u2019s, they would be rigidly rectilinear. If he told those hands to be wickedly childish, like Klee\u2019s, they would be wickedly childish. If he told those hands to be fumblingly angry, like Lazarro\u2019s, those magical hands of Stedman\u2019s could be that way, too.\nLazarro had sunk so low that it actually flashed into his mind to steal a painting of Stedman\u2019s, to sign his own name to it, to threaten the poor old man with violence if he dared to say a word.\nLazarro could sink no lower. He began to paint now about how low he felt\u2014about how crooked, how crude, how dirty Lazarro was. The painting was mostly black. It was the last painting Lazarro was ever going to do, and its title was No Damn Good.\nThere was a sound at the studio\u2019s front door, as though a sick animal were outside.
