from noon until eight o\u2019clock that night, without food or water, or a toilet or the slightest sound from the outside\u2014on what was to have been my first full day of freedom. Thus began a test of my character that I failed.\nI thought about Mary Kathleen and all she had been through. I still did not know that she was Mrs. Jack Graham, but she had told me something else very interesting about herself: After I left Harvard, after I stopped answering her letters or even thinking much about her anymore, she hitchhiked to Kentucky, where Kenneth Whistler was still working as a miner and an organizer. She arrived at sundown at the shack where he was living alone. The place was unlocked, having nothing inside worth stealing. Whistler was still at work. Mary Kathleen had brought food with her. When Whistler came home, there was smoke coming out of his chimney. There was a hot meal waiting for him inside.\nThat was how she got down into the coalfields. And that was how she happened, when Kenneth Whistler became violent late at night because of alcohol, to run out into the moonlit street of a shantytown and into the arms of a young mining engineer. He was, of course, Jack Graham.\nAnd then I regaled myself with a story by my prison friend Dr. Robert Fender, which he had published under the name of \u201cKilgore Trout.\u201d It was called \u201cAsleep at the Switch.\u201d It was about a huge reception center outside the Pearly Gates of heaven\u2014filled with computers and staffed by people who had been certified public accountants or investment counselors or business managers back on Earth.\nYou could not get into heaven until you had submitted to a full review of how well you had handled the business opportunities God, through His angels, had offered to you on Earth.\nAll day long and in every cubicle you could hear the experts saying with utmost weariness to people who had missed this opportunity and then that one: \u201cAnd there you were, asleep at the switch again.\u201d\nHow much time had I spent in solitary by then? I will make a guess: five minutes.\n\u201cAsleep at the Switch\u201d was quite a sacrilegious story. The hero was the ghost of Albert Einstein. He himself was so little interested in wealth that he scarcely heard what his auditor had to say to him. It was some sort of balderdash about how he could have become a billionaire, if only he had gotten a second mortgage on his house in Bern, Switzerland, in Nineteen-hundred and Five, and invested the money in known uranium deposits before telling the world that E=Mc2.\n\u201cBut there you were\u2014asleep at the switch again,\u201d said the auditor.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Einstein politely, \u201cit does seem rather typical.\u201d", 0.052628968253968234], "title": "Jailbird"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["change", 0.14916784661645824], ["plausible", 0.14598443807057532], ["showmanship", 0.14598443807057532], ["introduce", 0.14598443807057532], ["leadership", 0.14598443807057532], ["leader", 0.12798061519888845], ["lose", 0.12798061519888845], ["magnificently", 0.11744905394932574], ["blood", 0.10418085592942988], ["led", 0.08891366982807612], ["religion", 0.08891366982807612], ["mars", 0.0820579246121791], ["die", 0.07564547180818026], ["seer", 0.07299221903528766], ["lack", 0.07299221903528766], ["unforgettable", 0.07299221903528766], ["fizzles", 0.07299221903528766], ["content", 0.07299221903528766], ["traceable", 0.07299221903528766], ["bloodshed", 0.07299221903528766], ["willingness", 0.06399030759944423], ["genial", 0.06399030759944423], ["repentance", 0.06399030759944423], ["intention", 0.06399030759944423], ["wheel", 0.06399030759944423], ["deal", 0.05872452697466287], ["foolishly", 0.05872452697466287], ["genially", 0.05872452697466287], ["horror", 0.05872452697466287], ["rise", 0.05872452697466287], ["war", 0.05764164893649337], ["suicide", 0.05498839616360078], ["horribly", 0.05498839616360078], ["uwtb", 0.05209042796471494], ["failure", 0.05209042796471494], ["rumfoord", 0.04888742956243945], ["millions", 0.04772065865794593], ["period", 0.04772065865794593], ["wished", 0.04445683491403806], ["great", 0.04437345091659751], ["future", 0.04185072198595818], ["phoebe", 0.04185072198595818], ["case", 0.03782273590409013], ["history", 0.034086605093028036], ["better", 0.030679276983060624], ["pocket", 0.030679276983060624], ["knew", 0.025750840337542397], ["salo", 0.02326960349646825], ["turned", 0.0224490982806042], ["earthling", 0.022186725458298754], ["things", 0.020485059712761038], ["people", 0.020259192924295205], ["three", 0.01624614302922245], ["man", 0.013447186844760756]], "sentiment": ["When Phoebe did rise, every wheel was turned by Salo\u2019s UWTB.\nIt was Rumfoord\u2019s intention that Mars should lose the war\u2014that Mars should lose it foolishly and horribly.

will consider it a miracle if there is anything left to eat or enjoy by the year two thousand, now only fourteen years away?\n\u201cLike the people on this accursed ship, my boy, they are led by captains who have no charts or compasses, and who deal from minute to minute with no problem more substantial than how to protect their self-esteem.\u201d\nAs in life, he still needed a shave. As in life, he was still pale and haggard. As in life, he was still smoking a cigarette. And one reason, surely, that I found it hard to take another step in his direction was that I did not like him.\nI had run away from home when I was sixteen because I was so ashamed of him.\nIf there had been an angel in the mouth of the blue tunnel, instead of my father, I might have skipped right in.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJames Wait ran away from home because people were inflicting physical pain on him all the time. He might as well have gone straight from the delivery room to the Spanish Inquisition, so ingenious were some of the tortures the big brains of foster parents had devised for him. I ran away from a real parent who had never once in anger laid a hand on me.\nBut when I was too young to know any better, my father had made me his co-conspirator in driving my mother away forever. He had me jeering along with him at Mother for wanting to take a trip somewhere, to make some friends and have them over to dinner, to go to a movie or a restaurant sometime. I agreed with my father. I then believed that he was the greatest writer in the world, since that was all I could think to be proud of. We had no friends, and ours was the shabbiest house in the neighborhood, and we didn\u2019t even own a television set or an automobile. So why wouldn\u2019t I have defended him against my mother? To his credit, anyway, he never suggested that he might have greatness. When I was green in judgment, though, I found greatness implied in his insistence on doing nothing but writing and smoking all the time\u2014and I mean all the time.\nOh, yes, and there was one other thing I could be proud of, and this really counted for something in Cohoes: My father had been a United States Marine.\nWhen I got to be sixteen, though, I myself had arrived at the conclusion my mother and the neighbors had reached so long ago: that my father was a repellent failure, his work appearing only in the most disreputable publications, which paid him almost nothing. He was an insult to life itself, I thought, when he went on doing nothing with it but writing and smoking all the time\u2014and I mean all the time.", 0.12668707482993197], "title": "Galapagos"},

"sentiment": ["Eliot didn't look up again until the bus reached the outskirts of Indianapolis. He was astonished to see that the entire city was being consumed by a firestorm. He had never seen a fire-storm, but he had certainly read and dreamed about many of them.\nHe had a book hidden in his office, and it was a mystery even to Eliot as to why he should hide it, why he should feel guilty every time he got it out, why he should be afraid of being caught reading it. His feelings about the book were those of a weak-willed puritan with respect to pornography, yet no book could be more innocent of eroticism than the book he hid. It was called The Bombing of Germany. It was written by Hans Rumpf.\nAnd the passage Eliot would read over and over again, his features blank, his palms sweating, was this description of the fire-storms in Dresden:\nAs the many fires broke through the roofs of the burning buildings, a column of heated air rose more than two and a half miles high and one and a half miles in diameter.... This column was turbulent, and it was fed from its base by in-rushing cooler ground-surface air. One and one and a half miles from the fires this draught increased the wind velocity from eleven to thirty-three miles per hour. At the edge of the area the velocities must have been appreciably greater, as trees three feet in diameter were uprooted. In a short time the temperature reached ignition point for all combustibles, and the entire area was ablaze. In such fires complete burn-out occurred; that is, no trace of combustible material remained, and only after two days were the areas cool enough to approach.\nEliot, rising from his seat in the bus, beheld the firestorm of Indianapolis. He was awed by the majesty of the column of fire, which was at least eight miles in diameter and fifty miles high. The boundaries of the column seemed absolutely sharp and unwavering, as though made of glass. Within the boundaries, helixes of dull red embers turned in stately harmony about an inner core of white. The white seemed holy.\n14\nEVERYTHING WENT BLACK for Eliot, as black as what lay beyond the ultimate rim of the universe. And then he awoke to find himself sitting on the flat rim of a dry fountain. He was dappled by sunlight filtering down through a sycamore tree. A bird was singing in the sycamore tree. \"Poo-tee-weet?\" it sang. \"Poo-tee-weet. Weet, weet, weet.\" Eliot was within a high garden wall, and the garden was familiar. He had spoken to Sylvia many times in just this place. It was the garden of Dr. Brown's private mental hospital in Indianapolis, to which he had brought her so many years before. These words were cut into the fountain rim:\n\"Pretend to be good always, and even God will be fooled.\"\nEliot found that someone had dressed him for tennis, all in snowy white, and that, as though he were a department store display, someone had even put a tennis racket in his lap. He closed his hand around the racket handle experimentally, to discover whether it was real and whether he was real. He watched the play of the intricate basketwork of his forearm's musculature, sensed that he was not only a tennis player, but a good one. And he did not wonder where it was that he played tennis, for one side of the garden was bounded by a tennis court, with morning-glories and sweet peas twining in the chicken wire.\n\"Poo-tee-weet?\"", 0.06737085137085137], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["lens", 0.36653991437922984], ["paul", 0.22871226290014865], ["slide", 0.18326995718961492], ["shout", 0.17220526209531567], ["shouted", 0.12687237762063694], ["louder", 0.12217997145974327], ["microscope", 0.11480350806354377], ["fresh", 0.10045438529596881], ["frosted", 0.07517475866151406], ["mist", 0.07517475866151406], ["triangles", 0.07517475866151406], ["bitten", 0.07517475866151406], ["damaged", 0.07517475866151406], ["sprinkled", 0.07517475866151406], ["screwed", 0.07517475866151406], ["unbelievable", 0.07517475866151406], ["unscrewed", 0.07517475866151406], ["grains", 0.07517475866151406], ["examined", 0.07517475866151406], ["milky", 0.07517475866151406], ["dot", 0.07517475866151406], ["yell", 0.06628825634664297], ["poisonous", 0.06628825634664297], ["terror", 0.06628825634664297], ["bewilderment", 0.06628825634664297], ["radio", 0.06584087973317354], ["tissue", 0.061089985729871635], ["cracked", 0.061089985729871635], ["ragged", 0.05740175403177188], ["sheet", 0.05740175403177188], ["damage", 0.05740175403177188], ["wanting", 0.05740175403177188], ["shaking", 0.05740175403177188], ["dusted", 0.05740175403177188], ["knob", 0.05220348341500054], ["trembling", 0.05220348341500054], ["cruel", 0.050227192647984406], ["salt", 0.050227192647984406], ["fight", 0.045654436956462194], ["bedroom", 0.043316981100129444], ["fell", 0.043316981100129444], ["awful", 0.043316981100129444], ["quiet", 0.043316981100129444], ["crazy", 0.03676793464159111], ["cried", 0.03497611486755061], ["turn", 0.03292043986658677], ["hard", 0.031149281680935267], ["high", 0.031149281680935267], ["floor", 0.028539038665021943], ["man", 0.02846258934594186], ["woman", 0.027255917401470882], ["stood", 0.026089612552679515], ["place", 0.025813891972923567], ["turned", 0.020525016648163866], ["door", 0.02034570585361592], ["looked", 0.01563128559559903], ["going", 0.01479616633699696]], "sentiment": ["Paul unscrewed the lens, and examined it for damage.\nNow the man shouted back\u2014shouted something awful, unbelievable.\nPaul got a sheet of lens tissue from his bedroom, and dusted at the frosted dot on the lens, where the lens had bitten into the slide.

the play I am going to have a character say what people should say to each other in real life at the end of a marriage: I\u2019m sorry. You, being human, need a hundred affectionate and like-minded companions. I\u2019m only one person. I\u2019ve tried, but I could never be a hundred people to you. You\u2019ve tried, but you could never be a hundred people to me. Too bad. Good-bye.\u2019\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about incompatibility between parents and children, which happens often merely because of genetic rotten luck. In a nuclear family, children and parents can be locked in hellish close combat for twenty-one years and more. In an extended family, a child has scores of other homes to go to in search of love and understanding. He need not stay home and torture his parents, and he need not starve for love.\n\u201cIn an extended family, anybody can bug out of his own house for months, and still be among relatives. Nobody has to go on a hopeless quest for friendly strangers, which is what most Americans have to do.\n\u201cMassage parlors come to mind\u2014bus stations and bars.\n\u201cYou graduates here are leaving an artificial extended family now. Even if you hated it here, you will find a nuclear family to be a very poor substitute for what you had here. As for those of us who have come to praise you for having graduated: we have fled here from loneliness, to be part of an artificial extended family for just a little while.\n\u201cAnd what we will all be seeking when we decamp, and for the rest of our lives, will be large, stable communities of like-minded people, which is to say relatives. They no longer exist. The lack of them is not only the main cause, but probably the only cause of our shapeless discontent in the midst of such prosperity.\n\u201cWe thought we could do without tribes and clans. Well, we can\u2019t.\n\u201cThere was a time when I was avid to invent new religions and social orders. It has now penetrated my skull that such schemes will not work without the support of huge and gruesome police forces and prison systems, unless they are allowed to invent themselves. The emperor Constantine did not, after all, invent anything. He had many religions to choose from. He selected Christianity because it seemed to him to be the most refreshing.\n\u201cHitler and Lenin and some others have also tried to refresh their people with ideas that had been around awhile. They chose abominably, as we know. It matters what we choose. And history and the deteriorating physical and moral environments are now telling us what we would rather not hear, what we would rather our children or grandchildren would hear: It is our turn to choose.\n\u201cAt least we do not have to choose between various theories of magic, of ways to manipulate God and the devil and whatever, which is what our ancestors had to do.

He is now in the process of requesting classification as a conscientious objector. I thoroughly approve of what he is doing. It is in keeping with the way I have raised him. All his life he has learned hatred for killing from me.\nI was a volunteer in the Second World War. I was an infantry scout, saw plenty of action, was finally captured and served about six months as a prisoner of war in Germany. I have a Purple Heart. I was honorably discharged. I am entitled, it seems to me, to pass on to my son my opinion of killing. I don\u2019t even hunt or fish any more. I have some guns which I inherited, but they are covered with rust.\nThis attitude toward killing is a matter between my God and me. I do not participate much in organized religion. I have read the Bible a lot. I preach, after a fashion. I write books which express my disgust for people who find it easy and reasonable to kill.\nWe say grace at meals, taking turns. Every member of my large family has been called upon often to thank God for blessings which have been ours. What Mark is doing now is in the service of God, Whose Son was exceedingly un-warlike.\nThere isn\u2019t a grain of cowardice in this. Mark is a strong, courageous young man. What he is doing requires more guts than I ever had\u2014and more decency.\nMy family has been in this country for five generations now. My ancestors came here to escape the militaristic madness and tyranny of Europe, and to gain the freedom to answer the dictates of their own consciences. They and their descendents have been good citizens and proud to be Americans.
