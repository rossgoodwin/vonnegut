His work was exhibited in fine-arts museums and galleries.\nDear Don\u2014\nSaul Steinberg said to me that the painter Ingres was hobbled by too much talent. You are hobbled by too much to write about. You help me understand why novelists are such avoiders of adventure. Real life could swamp them so easily. So not living is a sacrifice we make.\nI thank you for the friendly review. I hadn\u2019t seen it. The best review so far was in Punch. Frivolous scientific speculation is an art form little appreciated over here. Critics who have come up through English departments don\u2019t like science mixed in with novels. They feel it should be kept in separate volumes, like Lives of a Cell and The Double Helix and so on. Victorians felt the same way about sex. It should be sequestered in manuals for specialists, they thought, it could so easily spoil a tale.\nDid you notice that Rita\u2019s friend Irina Grivnina was finally sprung from the Worker\u2019s Paradise, and has now taken up residence with her family in the Netherlands? I had a little to do with that, I think, writing Dobrynin frequently about my dear friend in Moscow, and getting his embassy to O.K. my invitations, all plastered with stamps and seals, for the whole family to come visit me. When they finally got out, I sent him a copy of Galapagos, most respectfully and gratefully inscribed. He wrote back, thanking me for the book, and saying, as though an afterthought, that my dear friend had left his country.\nCheers\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut", 0.16747835497835498], "title": "Letters"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["kennard", 0.2758681469978634], ["robinson", 0.135896381791427], ["crusoe", 0.135896381791427], ["herb", 0.1143695951012729], ["fleetwood", 0.11034725879914535], ["bottle", 0.09064265739479178], ["window", 0.08760488047172636], ["ell", 0.08753727617096567], ["police", 0.07452295552130468], ["windows", 0.0729184701378872], ["holster", 0.0679481908957135], ["stealing", 0.0679481908957135], ["counting", 0.0679481908957135], ["burglar", 0.0679481908957135], ["sarcastic", 0.0679481908957135], ["snook", 0.0679481908957135], ["investigate", 0.0679481908957135], ["liquor", 0.05988833995896994], ["candlelight", 0.05988833995896994], ["mattress", 0.05988833995896994], ["pneumonia", 0.05988833995896994], ["castle", 0.05988833995896994], ["excited", 0.055173629399572675], ["candle", 0.055173629399572675], ["buttoned", 0.055173629399572675], ["closer", 0.051828489022226386], ["healthy", 0.051828489022226386], ["count", 0.051828489022226386], ["double", 0.051828489022226386], ["duty", 0.047113778462829124], ["showroom", 0.047113778462829124], ["wondering", 0.047113778462829124], ["concerned", 0.04532132869739589], ["house", 0.04270258678602067], ["asked", 0.04228355177433048], ["rooms", 0.04117394562834086], ["anonymous", 0.04117394562834086], ["fifteen", 0.04117394562834086], ["magazine", 0.04006568772363941], ["stuck", 0.04006568772363941], ["reading", 0.04006568772363941], ["piece", 0.04006568772363941], ["lovers", 0.03905392752608557], ["changed", 0.038123198367090966], ["worth", 0.038123198367090966], ["dog", 0.03726147776065234], ["yeah", 0.0364592350689436], ["floor", 0.035708787148739284], ["glass", 0.03433921696668832], ["rest", 0.033710528347266504], ["buy", 0.03254676720125508], ["open", 0.030519402234455335], ["understand", 0.030519402234455335], ["family", 0.02920162682390879], ["fine", 0.02801810712263039], ["happy", 0.027648936211995736], ["white", 0.02660693436676681], ["night", 0.025650677410522953], ["couldn", 0.024767120352640136], ["left", 0.023179032736294198], ["work", 0.022694466499078293], ["told", 0.022229288189616673], ["three", 0.02178200585440974], ["thought", 0.018382145813837725], ["thing", 0.017438825525321812], ["looked", 0.016849944911150244], ["people", 0.01615345489276572], ["time", 0.011992558856499328], ["man", 0.011083666148948906]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI mean, that old house has fifteen rooms, not counting the ell,\u201d said Kennard, \u201cand a family of four\u2014five, if you count the dog.

It was Dr. von Kleigstadt, EPICAC\u2019s designer, who gave me the terrible news. He was on the verge of tears. \"Ruined! Ausgespielt! Shot! Kaput! Buggered!\" he said in a choked voice. He hung up.\nWhen I arrived at EPICAC\u2019s room the air was thick with the oily stench of burned insulation. The ceiling over EPICAC was blackened with smoke, and my ankles were tangled in coils of paper ribbon that covered the floor. There wasn\u2019t enough left of the poor devil to add two and two. A junkman would have been out of his head to offer more than fifty dollars for the cadaver.\nDr. von Kleigstadt was prowling through the wreckage, weeping unashamedly, followed by three angry-looking Major Generals and a platoon of Brigadiers, Colonels, and Majors. No one noticed me. I didn\u2019t want to be noticed. I was through\u2014I knew that. I was upset enough about that and the untimely demise of my friend EPICAC, without exposing myself to a tongue-lashing.\nBy chance, the free end of EPICAC\u2019s paper ribbon lay at my feet. I picked it up and found our conversation of the night before. I choked up. There was the last word he had said to me, \"15-8,\" that tragic, defeated \"Oh.\" There were dozens of yards of numbers stretching beyond that point. Fearfully, I read on.\n\"I don\u2019t want to be a machine, and I don\u2019t want to think about war,\" EPICAC had written after Pat\u2019s and my light-hearted departure. \"I want to be made out of protoplasm and last forever so Pat will love me. But fate has made me a machine. That is the only problem I cannot solve. That is the only problem I want to solve. I can\u2019t go on this way.\" I swallowed hard. \"Good luck, my friend. Treat our Pat well. I am going to short-circuit myself out of your lives forever. You will find on the remainder of this tape a modest wedding present from your friend, EPICAC.\"\nOblivious to all else around me, I reeled up the tangled yards of paper ribbon from the floor, draped them in coils about my arms and neck, and departed for home. Dr. von Kleigstadt shouted that I was fired for having left EPICAC on all night. I ignored him, too overcome with emotion for small talk.\nI loved and won\u2014EPICAC loved and lost, but he bore me no grudge. I shall always remember him as a sportsman and a gentleman. Before he departed this vale of tears, he did all he could to make our marriage a happy one. EPICAC gave me anniversary poems for Pat\u2014enough for the next 500 years.\nDe mortuis nil nisi bonum\u2014Say nothing but good of the dead.\n(1950)\nADAM", 0.02408854166666667], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
