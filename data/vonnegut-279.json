[\u2026]\nCheers\u2014\nKYPT\nSeptember 8, 1979\nSagaponack, NY\nTO NANNY VONNEGUT\nDearest Nanny\u2014\nI want you to be the first person in our family to find this out: That Jill and I have decided to marry each other in November, probably a couple of days after Thanksgiving. Jill will then be three months shy of being forty, and we will have lived together about nine years. The first years of the relationship were tempestuous. Much of the tempest was my fault, surely. I was in a frenzied state of mourning and dismay over the failure of my once good marriage to Jane. Jill had nothing to do with that failure, but she was handy to blame. Be that as it may, Jill and I behave most affectionately and reasonably toward each other now, and unselfishly. We are in love. Our heads are clear. We are working and playing most cheerfully.\nI do not endorse serial marriage for anyone. I myself have always wished to be as monogamous as a swan. I was monogamous with your mother until the very end, and will be so with Jill.\nMarrying Jill was my idea. It seemed only fair. I told her parents last night at a restaurant on Shelter Island. Our table was by the water. Her parents almost fell in. They were the first to know. Now you are the second. Edie doesn\u2019t know yet.
