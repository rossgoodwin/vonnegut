The chair on Lasher\u2019s left was pulled out for him, and Finnerty took the chair on Lasher\u2019s right.\nAs Paul sat down, he noted that only Luke Lubbock wore a ghost shirt, and he supposed that Luke couldn\u2019t accomplish anything without a uniform of some sort.\n\u201cMeeting of the Ghost Shirt Society will come to order,\u201d said Lasher.\nPaul, with a trace of drug-inspired whimsey still in his bloodstream, had expected a show of fraternal-order nonsense, full of quasi-Indian talk. Instead, save for Luke Lubbock\u2019s shirt, the meeting belonged very much to the present, a sordid, realistic present, an angry present.\nThe Ghost Shirt Society, then, was simply a convenient and dramatic title for a businesslike group, a title whose historical roots were of interest principally to Lasher and his disciple Finnerty, who entertained each other with elaborate commentaries on the insufferable status quo. For the rest, simple commentaries, special personal resentments, were reasons enough for joining anything that promised a change for the better. Promised a change for the better, or, Paul amended his thought after looking into some of the eyes, promised some excitement for a change.\nWhat Bud Calhoun was doing here, Paul couldn\u2019t imagine, since Bud wasn\u2019t at all interested in political action and was without capacity for resentment. As Bud had said of himself, \u201cAll Ah want is time an\u2019 equipmen\u2019 to faht around with, and Ah\u2019m happy as a pig in mud.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start with you, Z-II,\u201d said Lasher, looking at Katharine.\nThere were circles under Katharine\u2019s gentle, wondering eyes, and she looked startled when Lasher called on her, as though Lasher, the meeting, the underground chamber, had suddenly risen about her in her clean, girlish world. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, and rattled the papers on the table before her. \u201cWe now have seven hundred and fifty-eight ghost shirts on hand. Our quota for now was a thousand,\u201d she said wearily, \u201cbut Mrs. Fishbein\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo names!\u201d cried several of the members.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d She blushed, and referred to her papers. \u201cEr, X-229 came down with cataracts and had to stop the design work. She\u2019ll be all right in about six weeks, and can get back to work.

That book in paperback still sells tens of thousands of copies every year.\nThe producers of the film, Max Youngstein and Bruce Campbell, asked me what actor should play the leading character, Dwayne Hoover, a very successful Pontiac dealer, and owner of a couple of fast food franchises, too, in an Ohio factory town of slightly under one-hundred thousand people. He is slowly going to pieces because of the success of foreign cars in the American market, because his son has grown up to be a flamboyant homosexual piano player in the local Holiday Inn cocktail lounge on the Interstate, and so on. If you know the book, then you know that he blows up spectacularly during the town\u2019s first Festival of the Arts.\nI told Max and Bruce that only you could project the charismatic, absolutely beautiful, one-hundred per cent American deep-seated insanity which afflicts this man.", 0.23070707070707072], "title": "Letters"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["crying", 0.1860367265150582], ["sheila", 0.11522763904137318], ["courses", 0.10511014768309009], ["plan", 0.07954355648930707], ["herb", 0.06691010325652699], ["extent", 0.059628004255422036], ["durham", 0.059628004255422036], ["laughs", 0.059628004255422036], ["adjustment", 0.059628004255422036], ["bluffers", 0.059628004255422036], ["luncheon", 0.059628004255422036], ["correspondence", 0.059628004255422036], ["bluff", 0.059628004255422036], ["bluffer", 0.059628004255422036], ["locksmiths", 0.059628004255422036], ["care", 0.05811861517300752], ["learning", 0.05255507384154504], ["pelk", 0.05255507384154504], ["extension", 0.05255507384154504], ["admit", 0.05255507384154504], ["swindle", 0.04841767477921684], ["degree", 0.04841767477921684], ["kennard", 0.04841767477921684], ["sessions", 0.04841767477921684], ["teach", 0.04841767477921684], ["bothered", 0.04841767477921684], ["housewifery", 0.04841767477921684], ["wasted", 0.04548214342766805], ["copy", 0.04548214342766805], ["studying", 0.04548214342766805], ["sex", 0.04548214342766805], ["wasn", 0.04346882347606228], ["wondered", 0.04320516841425775], ["sleeping", 0.04320516841425775], ["pretending", 0.04320516841425775], ["combination", 0.04320516841425775], ["polite", 0.04320516841425775], ["grown", 0.041344744365339844], ["answered", 0.041344744365339844], ["understanding", 0.041344744365339844], ["duty", 0.041344744365339844], ["discovery", 0.041344744365339844], ["la", 0.039771778244653534], ["joy", 0.039771778244653534], ["drugstore", 0.039771778244653534], ["summer", 0.038409213013791056], ["couch", 0.038409213013791056], ["couple", 0.038409213013791056], ["interesting", 0.038409213013791056], ["meeting", 0.038409213013791056], ["university", 0.038409213013791056], ["going", 0.03700455394290991], ["quit", 0.03515968514523458], ["silly", 0.03515968514523458], ["forever", 0.033455051628263496], ["question", 0.03269884783077654], ["awful", 0.03269884783077654], ["windows", 0.03199483893805254], ["laid", 0.03133628259991406], ["books", 0.030717664009950442], ["thing", 0.030606918268932158], ["week", 0.030134414889134643], ["passed", 0.029582708549642033], ["state", 0.02905930758650376], ["started", 0.028561448768448332], ["women", 0.028086754731357588], ["window", 0.025625917416899548], ["hadn", 0.024587318495369524], ["days", 0.024263352186037073], ["making", 0.02334894240348924], ["business", 0.02148851835457134], ["time", 0.02104816452365188], ["called", 0.021013824317480598], ["mind", 0.020784509461847348], ["school", 0.019709402159216464], ["told", 0.019507334533745244], ["woman", 0.01892408541292944], ["lot", 0.018736849304070293], ["love", 0.017514388081492534], ["things", 0.015988554061380656], ["years", 0.015436847721888046], ["looked", 0.014786686350601234], ["good", 0.012041891050196863]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYou going to do more, Sheila?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said.
