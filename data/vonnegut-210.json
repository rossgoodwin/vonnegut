I am told that he once said of the Nobel prize: \u201cEvery Vaseline-ass in Europe has one. Where\u2019s mine?\u201d\nAnd yet, compulsively, with no financial gain in prospect, and understanding that many people will believe that I share many of his authentically vile opinions, I continue to say that there were good things about this man. And my name is most snugly tied to his in the Penguin paperback editions of his last three books, Castle to Castle, North, and Rigadoon. My name is on each cover: \u201cWith a new introduction,\u201d it says, \u201cby Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.\u201d\nThat introduction to all three paperbacks goes like this:\nHe was in the worst possible taste, by which I mean that he had many educational advantages, becoming a physician, and he was widely traveled in Europe and Africa and North America\u2014and yet he wrote not a single phrase that hinted to similarly advantaged persons that he was something of a gentleman.\nHe did not seem to understand that aristocratic restraints and sensibilities, whether inherited or learned, accounted for much of the splendor of literature. In my opinion, he discovered a higher and more awful order of literary truth by ignoring the crippled vocabularies of ladies and gentlemen and by using, instead, the more comprehensive language of shrewd and tormented guttersnipes.\nEvery writer is in his debt, and so is anyone else interested in discussing lives in their entirety. By being so impolite, he demonstrated that perhaps half of all experience, the animal half, had been concealed by good manners. No honest writer or speaker will ever want to be polite again.\nC\u00e9line has been praised as a stylist. He himself mocked the endlessly repeated typographical trick that made every page he wrote easily recognizable as being his: \u2019Me and my three dots \u2026 my supposedly original style! \u2026 all the real writers will tell you what to think of it! \u2026\u2019\nThe only writers who admire that style enough to imitate it, as far as I know, are gossip columnists. They like its looks. They like the sense of urgency it imparts, willy-nilly, to any piece of information at all.\nWith no especial help from his eccentric typography, in my opinion, C\u00e9line gave us in his novels the finest history we have of the total collapse of Western civilization in two world wars, as witnessed by hideously vulnerable common women and men. That history should be read in the order in which it was written, for each volume speaks knowingly to the ones that came before it.\nAnd the resonating chamber for this intricate system of echoes through time is C\u00e9line\u2019s first novel, Journey to the End of the Night, published in 1932, when the author was thirty-eight. It is important that a reader of any C\u00e9line book know in his heart what C\u00e9line knew so well, that his writing career began with a masterpiece.", 0.08186033927313], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["crematorium", 0.45813743240998794], ["gasoline", 0.19344528196850191], ["bars", 0.16330520393383335], ["chocolate", 0.16330520393383335], ["smokeless", 0.16330520393383335], ["won", 0.15490050822789606], ["drive", 0.1423007439168653], ["guido", 0.1423007439168653], ["limits", 0.13001392245904214], ["rochester", 0.12915001162394055], ["surprised", 0.12129628389989729], ["dad", 0.10900946244207413], ["gas", 0.10900946244207413], ["smoke", 0.10900946244207413], ["hurt", 0.104338229720036], ["cinema", 0.09672264098425096], ["complex", 0.09672264098425096], ["meadowdale", 0.09672264098425096], ["pay", 0.08557946582893831], ["lost", 0.07252543806856092], ["hear", 0.0682902276935561], ["city", 0.06700054240813803], ["money", 0.061265936358485665], ["head", 0.05644579409697998], ["will", 0.0538834490052205], ["valley", 0.04795179515291458], ["time", 0.02227610241390841]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYou might be surprised,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWell, Dad,\u201d he said, \u201cit certainly won\u2019t be the first time.\u201d\n\u201cCAN YOU TELL me who in this valley might have gasoline?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll pay anything.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have enough gas to make it back to Rochester?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201chead back the way you came.

Jeffrey.\u201d And the noises inside were unfamiliar, too: dance music and women\u2019s voices. Nicky hadn\u2019t had much to do with women, except for his mother. The assumption, his assumption, was that women, hundreds of them and all beautiful and talented, would come his way automatically once his career was going full blast. That had been his father\u2019s experience, so it would certainly happen to Nicky, too.\nThen I remembered that George B. Jeffrey was Nicky\u2019s business name, and I knocked. A uniformed maid, carrying a tray of martinis, opened the door. \u201cYes?\u201d\nBehind her I saw Nicky\u2019s one room. It was now spotless, and elegantly furnished in dark Victorian furniture. The scrapbook was still there on the table, but rebound in expensive-looking plush and leather. And the pictures of his father and the posters still covered the walls, but they were now protected by glass in massive gilt frames. The room looked more like a well-run museum than a studio.\nThe sounds of celebration puzzled me, because I couldn\u2019t see anyone in the room behind the maid, and the only rooms opening onto it were the bathroom, the kitchenette, and a closet. \u201cIs Mr. Marino in?\u201d I said.\n\u201cMr. Jeffrey?\u201d said the maid.\n\u201cYes\u2014Mr. Jeffrey. I\u2019m a friend of his.\u201d\nThe heavy drapes on one side of the room parted, and Nicky appeared, flushed, happy, and I saw that the wall separating Nicky\u2019s old room from the next apartment had been knocked out, and that he now had a suite. The drapes closed behind him, so that I had only a glimpse of what lay beyond\u2014a room hazy with smoke and laughter, garishly modern. It was like looking into a sunset from the mouth of a cave.\n\u201cHappy birthday, happy birthday,\u201d said Nicky.\n\u201cCelebrating the sale of your business?\u201d\n\u201cHmmm?
