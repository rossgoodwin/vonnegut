Contrary to what you may wish to believe, one doesn\u2019t have to be Spanish to paint well. Prior\u2019s pictures, which are usually huge, look like color photographs of situations in dreams.\nThe gloomy reports of Jane\u2019s health are based on the informed pessimism of my son the doctor. The treatments with platinum have been stopped, since she responded with intolerable nausea that went on for weeks. So, as I understand it, she isn\u2019t being treated with much of anything just now, save for a sensible diet. So she is the same Jane you celebrate in your letter of nine days ago, except that she has lost all her hair. She will be merry, utterly open Jane at the wedding\u2014in a wig. And who knows? She could outlive all of us.\nEvery author in the world must have been deeply satisfied when M\u00e1rquez got the Nobel, and every author in the world would agree with you, that Borges should have got it first. My guess is that Borges will never get it. I have no idea why not. I only say that as a gambling man. What the hell. You can\u2019t buy a really good house with the prize money any more anyway. [\u2026]\nAs for your attachments to students we had at Iowa: those came very close to being blood relationships.

They came home on the main highways. Nobody was looking for them anymore.\nTheir radio was on, and every news broadcast told the world the splendid news: Annie and Rice were to be married at once. True love had won another stunning victory.\nBy the time the lovers reached the Indiana border, they had heard the news of their indescribable happiness a dozen times. They were beginning to look like department store clerks on Christmas Eve, jangled and exhausted by relentless tidings of great joy.\nRice turned off the radio. Annie gave an involuntary sigh of relief. They hadn\u2019t talked much on the trip home. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything to talk about: everything was so settled\u2014everything was so, as they say in business, finalized.\nAnnie and Rice got into a traffic jam in Indianapolis and were locked for stoplight after stoplight next to a car in which a baby was howling. The parents of the child were very young.
