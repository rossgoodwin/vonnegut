lugubriously historic shoal outside the *Captain\u2019s home! I was surprised that he wanted to look at it every day. It was down that same half-drowned hump that *Hisako Hiroguchi and the blind *Selena MacIntosh had waded hand in hand, seeking and finding together the blue tunnel into the Afterlife. *Selena was then forty-eight and still fertile. *Hisako was fifty-six, and had not ovulated for quite some time.\nAkiko was still upset every time she saw the shoal. She couldn\u2019t help feeling responsible for the suicides of the two women who had raised her\u2014even though *Mandarax had said it surely *Hisako\u2019s intractable, monopolar, and probably inherited depression which had killed them both.\nBut there was the fact, inescapable for Akiko, that *Hisako and *Selena had killed themselves soon after Akiko set up housekeeping on her own.\nShe was then twenty-two. Kamikaze hadn\u2019t reached puberty yet, so he had nothing to do with it. She was simply living alone, and enjoying it quite a bit. She was well past the age when most people flew the nest, and I was all for her doing it. I had seen how much pain it caused her when *Hisako and *Selena continued to speak to her in baby talk long after she had become such a robust and capable woman. And yet she had put up with it for an awfully long time\u2014because she was so grateful for all they had done for her when she was genuinely helpless.\nOn the day she left, they were still cutting up her booby meat for her, if you can believe it.\nFor a month after that, they still set a place for her at every meal, with the meat already all cut up, and they cooed at her and teased her gently even though she wasn\u2019t there anymore.\nAnd then, one day, life just wasn\u2019t worth living anymore.\n*Mary Hepburn, for all her ailments, was still self-sufficient when she went to see the *Captain on his deathbed. She still gathered and prepared her own food, and kept her home as neat as a pin. She was proud of this, and should have been. The *Captain was a burden on the community, which was to say a burden on Akiko. *Mary was surely not. She had often said that, if ever she felt that she was about to become a burden to anybody, she would follow Hisako and Selena down the shoal, and join her second husband on the ocean floor.\nThe contrast between her feet and those of the pampered *Captain were striking. Their feet certainly had very different stories to tell. His were white and soft. Hers were tough and brown as the rock-climbing boots she had brought with her to Guayaquil so long ago.\nSo she said to this man to whom she hadn\u2019t spoken for twenty years, \u201cThey tell me you\u2019re very sick.\u201d", 0.10958646616541357], "title": "Galapagos"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["monday", 0.18566613809790358], ["robo", 0.17096621015271685], ["magic", 0.14903270745458252], ["laundry", 0.13914624232985456], ["fred", 0.05576185817551493], ["billboard", 0.05565849693194183], ["advertising", 0.05565849693194183], ["balloon", 0.05182273596591808], ["motto", 0.044361192126779116], ["depression", 0.0410103330830337], ["women", 0.03811407457154546], ["clearest", 0.03515333039042498], ["recollections", 0.03515333039042498], ["1933", 0.03515333039042498], ["pearls", 0.03515333039042498], ["fallen", 0.03515333039042498], ["clumped", 0.03515333039042498], ["bitter", 0.03515333039042498], ["millipedes", 0.03515333039042498], ["exhausted", 0.03515333039042498], ["cleverly", 0.03515333039042498], ["traditionally", 0.03515333039042498], ["idleness", 0.03515333039042498], ["jostle", 0.03515333039042498], ["disgusted", 0.03515333039042498], ["barry", 0.032530482860100414], ["blue", 0.031047474391964088], ["hated", 0.030532349186692013], ["washday", 0.030532349186692013], ["fur", 0.030532349186692013], ["horrible", 0.030532349186692013], ["shriek", 0.030532349186692013], ["pleasant", 0.030532349186692013], ["leaving", 0.030532349186692013], ["low", 0.030532349186692013], ["depressing", 0.030532349186692013], ["reliable", 0.030532349186692013], ["beetles", 0.030532349186692013], ["gate", 0.030532349186692013], ["practically", 0.030532349186692013], ["coat", 0.030532349186692013], ["great", 0.027932609709544014], ["return", 0.027829248465970916], ["eve", 0.027829248465970916], ["stepmother", 0.027829248465970916], ["corporation", 0.027829248465970916], ["cheer", 0.027829248465970916], ["machine", 0.02738831644927395], ["mansion", 0.02591136798295904], ["washing", 0.02591136798295904], ["jobs", 0.02591136798295904], ["defunct", 0.02591136798295904], ["account", 0.02591136798295904], ["estate", 0.02591136798295904], ["separate", 0.02591136798295904], ["symbol", 0.02591136798295904], ["pretended", 0.02591136798295904], ["work", 0.024957362358687885], ["society", 0.024423744307530977], ["christmas", 0.024423744307530977], ["invented", 0.024423744307530977], ["afford", 0.024423744307530977], ["confused", 0.024423744307530977], ["sell", 0.024423744307530977], ["ads", 0.022180596063389558], ["decided", 0.022180596063389558], ["afternoon", 0.022180596063389558], ["persons", 0.022180596063389558], ["attention", 0.021290386779226074], ["ideas", 0.021290386779226074], ["main", 0.02050516654151685], ["basement", 0.02050516654151685], ["sales", 0.019802763103798006], ["day", 0.019258108827662025], ["family", 0.019167361905102508], ["suddenly", 0.019167361905102508], ["simply", 0.019167361905102508], ["message", 0.019167361905102508], ["call", 0.018587286058504977], ["rest", 0.01805366800734807], ["nigger", 0.01805366800734807], ["true", 0.01755961485965659], ["began", 0.016669405575493106], ["felt", 0.016265241430050207], ["incidentally", 0.01588418533778388], ["town", 0.01588418533778388], ["keedsler", 0.01588418533778388], ["mouth", 0.01588418533778388], ["coming", 0.01588418533778388], ["week", 0.015523737195982044], ["time", 0.015242801040937936], ["woman", 0.01518178190006504], ["company", 0.01518178190006504], ["idea", 0.014856514138935493], ["automobile", 0.013966304854772007], ["instance", 0.013432686803615099], ["young", 0.012704691523848486], ["high", 0.012048424371760135], ["wasn", 0.010902755992249075], ["long", 0.010902755992249075], ["called", 0.010729586082894002], ["going", 0.010396183279062927], ["people", 0.010016146420196086], ["black", 0.008437775822208506], ["midland", 0.006370076300182909], ["man", 0.006281774788516105], ["city", 0.0057752020753299585], ["hoover", 0.005614551731469555], ["dwayne", 0.0030721013546088625]], "sentiment": ["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe motto of the old Robo-Magic washing machine cleverly confused two separate ideas people had about Monday. One idea was that women traditionally did their laundry on Monday. Monday was simply washday, and not an especially depressing day on that account.\nPeople who had horrible jobs during the week used to call Monday \u201cBlue Monday\u201d sometimes, though, because they hated to return to work after a day of rest. When Fred T. Barry made up the Robo-Magic motto as a young man, he pretended that Monday was called \u201cBlue Monday\u201d because doing the laundry disgusted and exhausted women.\nThe Robo-Magic was going to cheer them up.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt wasn\u2019t true, incidentally, that most women did their laundry on Monday at the time the Robo-Magic was invented. They did it any time they felt like it. One of Dwayne Hoover\u2019s clearest recollections from the Great Depression, for instance, was when his stepmother decided to do the laundry on Christmas Eve. She was bitter about the low estate to which the family had fallen, and she suddenly clumped down into the basement, down among the black beetles and the millipedes, and did the laundry.\n\u201cTime to do the Nigger work,\u201d she said.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFred T. Barry began advertising the Robo-Magic in 1933, long before there was a reliable machine to sell. And he was one of the few persons in Midland City who could afford billboard advertising during the Great Depression, so the Robo-Magic sales message did not have to jostle and shriek for attention. It was practically the only symbol in town.\nOne of Fred\u2019s ads was on a billboard outside the main gate of the defunct Keedsler Automobile Company, which the Robo-Magic Corporation had taken over. It showed a high society woman in a fur coat and pearls. She was leaving her mansion for a pleasant afternoon of idleness, and a balloon was coming out of her mouth.

\u2019Must We Do without References?\u2019 Please cross that out, in case you want to remember later on what really happened here. The new title is Tear and Loathing in Morristown, New Jersey,\u2019 and I want you all to know how safe I feel up here. If I go crazy, you will know all the latest things to do about it. I will be out of the nuthouse and back on the streets in no time, coked to the gills on Thorazine.\n\u201cThe tide in your programs is a typographical error anyway. It should have been \u2019Must We Do without Reference Points?\u2019 You might want to add that word \u2019Points\u2019 to the original tide before you cross the whole thing out, which reminds me of a very funny story. There was a man in a restaurant, and he called the waiter over, and he said, \u2019Waiter\u2014there is a needle in my soup.\u2019 And the waiter said to him, \u2019Oh sir, I am so sorry. That is a typographical error. It should have been a noodle.\u2019\n\u201cWhen I thought I was going to talk about reference points, I had in mind the fixtures in a simpler and more stable civilization than what we have today. Examples: Shakepeare\u2019s Hamlet, Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony, Leonardo\u2019s Mona Lisa, Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address, Mark Twain\u2019s Huckleberry Finn\u2014the Great Wall of China, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Sphinx. These few works of art used to be enormous monuments in the minds of public school graduates in every corner of this country. They have now been drowned in our minds, like Atlantis, if you will, by the latest sensations on television and radio, and in our motion picture palaces and People magazine.\n\u201cTime was when a worker in the mental health field in America would have a few reference points in common with a native-born maniac, could begin a therapeutic conversation with comments on the smile of the Mona Lisa, say. It was a beginning. But nowadays, I would think, a therapist has to be prepared to discuss in depth Beach Blanket Bingo or The Texas Chainsaw Murders or Howdy Doody or Romper Room or Walter Cronkite\u2014and just on and on and on. Farrah Fawcett-Majors. No subject of conversation lives much longer than a lightning bug these days. I have a son who is a gag writer on the West Coast, and he wrote what he thought was a very funny skit about Howdy Doody. I had to explain to him that there were millions of Americans older and younger than he was, who did not know or care who Howdy Doody was. He was shattered. When he was seven years old, Howdy Doody was God to him.\n\u201cBut I have scrapped that particular speech, as I say. I didn\u2019t have the brains to pull it off It was too ambitious\u2014not only for me but for lunch at a New Jersey motel. So I have decided to talk instead about how honored I am to be here. If some of you are taking notes, you should write that down: \u2019Honored to be asked to speak on mental health\u2019\u2014something like that.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you invited me. Perhaps it is because my son Mark went insane. He is not the gag writer. That is another son. The one who went insane is well now. He graduated from Harvard Medical School a year ago, and is an intern in Boston now. He, too, is a magnificent speaker. He loves to ask an audience of workers in the mental health field, \u2019How many of you have ever taken Thorazine?\u2019 Almost no hands go up, and my son the doctor gives a little smile, and he says: \u2019It won\u2019t hurt you. You really ought to try it sometime, just to get an inkling, anyway, of what your patients are going through.\u2019\n\u201cYour organizers asked me what degrees I held. Even if I were a trapeze artist, they would have to ask me that, I guess. So I ransacked the drawers of my bedside table for documents. I found a long-lost pair of cuff links, unfortunately only gold-plated. I found a snapshot of my sister Alice when she was only sixteen. She died here in New Jersey at the age of forty-one, and not in the best of mental health. I found a diploma from the University of Chicago, which is west of here. It declared that I had earned a master\u2019s degree in anthropology. I looked up the word in a dictionary. It turned out to be the study of man.\n\u201cAt the University of Chicago so long ago, I had to select a specialty from these five fields in anthropology: archaeology, cultural anthropology, ethnology, linguistics, and physical anthropology. I chose cultural anthropology, since it offered the greatest opportunity to write high-minded balderdash. Culture, of course, is every object and idea which has been shaped by men and women and children, and not by God. Cultural anthropology is a broad specialty, you might say. I never heard of a cultural anthropologist who came down with claustrophobia.\n\u201cIt was that damn fool diploma which made me believe for a moment that I could speak to you as an expert on culture, about that bed of Procrustes which maladjusted persons find so uncomfortable. My one son Mark found it so uncomfortable that he tried to beat his brains out on it, and had to be put in a padded cell. Really. That is how cracy he was. He would have tried to kill himself with a Stradivarius violin, if there had been one around\u2014or the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or Walter Cronkite\u2019s mustache.\n\u201cBut I am a storyteller, not a cultural anthropologist, no matter what the diploma says. And I am not even the best storyteller in my own family when it comes to the relationship of culture to mental health. My son Mark is the best storyteller in that area. He wrote an excellent book about going crazy and recovering. It is called The Eden Express. Mark remembers everything. His wish is to tell people who are going insane something about the shape of the roller coaster they are on. It helps sometimes to know the shape of a roller coaster.

When I moved Margaret and Mildred into our new home in the ghost town and pulled down the blinds, it was to them as though we had never left Scipio. There was a surprise present for me on our freshly sodded front lawn, a rowboat. The Warden had found an old boat that had been lying in the weeds behind the ruins of the old Athena Post Office since before I was born, quite possibly. He had had some of his guards fiberglass the outside of it, making it watertight again after all these years.\nIt looked a lot like the hide-covered Eskimo umiak that used to be in the rotunda outside the Dean of Women\u2019s Office here, with the outlines of the ribs showing through the fiberglass.\nI know what happened to a lot of college property after the prison break, the GRIOT\u2122 and so on, but I haven\u2019t a clue what became of that umiak.\nIf it hadn\u2019t been on display in the rotunda, I and hundreds of Tarkington students and their parents would have gone all the way through life without ever seeing a genuine Eskimo umiak.\nI MADE LOVE to Muriel Peck in that boat. I lay on the bottom, and she sat upright, holding my mother-in-law\u2019s fishing rod, pretending to be a perfect lady and all alone.\nThat was my idea. What a good sport she was!\nI DON\u2019T KNOW what became of the man who claimed his name was John Donner, who wanted to teach shop at Athena, 8 years before the prison break. I do know that the Warden gave him very short shrift during his job interview, since the last things the prison needed inside its walls were chisels and screwdrivers and hacksaws and band saws and ball-peen hammers and so on.\nI had to wait for Donner outside the Warden\u2019s Office. He was my ticket back to civilization, to my home and family and copy of Black Garterbelt. I didn\u2019t watch Howdy Doody on the little screen. I interested myself in another person, who was waiting to see the Warden. His color-coding alone would have told me that he was a convict, but he was also wearing leg irons and handcuffs, and was seated quietly on a bench facing mine across the corridor, with a masked and rubber-gloved guard on either side of him.\nHe was reading a cheap-looking booklet. Since he was literate, I thought he might be one of the people I was being hired to divert with knowledge. I was right. His name was Abdullah Akbahr. With my encouragement, he would write several interesting short stories. One, I remember, was supposedly the autobiography of a talking deer in the National Forest who has a terrible time finding anything to eat in winter and gets tangled in barbed wire during the summer months, trying to get at the delicious food on farms. He is shot by a hunter. As he dies he wonders why he was born in the first place. The final sentence of the story was the last thing the deer said on Earth. The hunter was close enough to hear it and was amazed.

Celia in her casket there, all shot through with Drno and amphetamine, might have been a dead cell sloughed off by a pancreas the size of the Milky Way.\nHow comical that I, a single cell, should take my life so seriously!\nI found myself smiling at a funeral.\nI stopped smiling. I glanced around to see if anyone had noticed. One person had. He was at the other end of our pew, and he did not look away when I caught him gazing at me. He went right on gazing, and it was I who faced forward again. I had not recognized him. He was wearing large sunglasses with mirrored lenses. He could have been anyone.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut then I became the center of attention for the full congregation, for Reverend Harrell had mentioned my name. He was talking about Rudy Waltz. I was Rudy Waltz. To whoever might be watching our insignificant lives under an electron microscope: We cells have names, and, if we know little else, we know our names.\nReverend Harrell told the congregation of the six weeks when he and the late Celia Hoover, n\u00e9e Hildreth, and the playwright Rudy Waltz had known blissful unselfishness which could serve as a good example for the rest of the world. He was talking about the local production of Katmandu. He had played the part of John Fortune, the Ohio pilgrim to nowhere, and Celia had played the ghost of his wife. He was a gifted actor. He resembled a lion.\nFor all I know, Celia may have fallen in love with him. For all I know, Celia may have fallen in love with me. In any case, the Reverend and I were clearly unavailable.\nAs only a gifted actor could, the Reverend made the Mask and Wig Club\u2019s production of Katmandu, and especially Celia\u2019s performance, sound as though it had enriched lives all over town. My own calculation is that people were as moved by the play as they might have been by a good game of basketball.

the Watergate scandal, Jailbird. He used the technique of entering the novel with his own personal memories and experience, as he first had done in Slaughterhouse-Five.\nOne of the biggest changes in his life and career had come in 1970 with a break in his friendship and professional relationship with Knox Burger. Knox told me he started his literary agency with the belief that Kurt would be his star client and was shocked when it didn\u2019t work out. Knox said he wrote Kurt a long letter advising him on his career and that Kurt had not liked it and told him he \u201cdidn\u2019t want an uncle.\u201d Kurt\u2019s loyalty to his first agent, Max Wilkinson, and Wilkinson\u2019s reluctance to let him go was part of the tangle of misunderstandings. Bad blood developed between Knox and Kurt, which continued for a number of years, but finally the friendship, if not the business relationship, was restored.\nLater the same year Kurt formed what was to become a lifelong professional alliance with the theatrical attorney Don Farber, whom he had met at a dinner party on Long Island. Farber served as Kurt\u2019s agent, negotiator, and adviser in personal as well as professional matters\u2014in every part of life imaginable, from dealings with wives and children to publishers and producers. Don and his wife, Annie, became Kurt\u2019s closest friends and advisers, cornerstones and bulwarks of his life in all its aspects from the time they met.\nIn the midst of all the crises and changes in his life and the tremendous amount of work he did in this decade, Vonnegut found time for fun and good-humored enterprises. Taking time out from all his personal and professional concerns and pressures, Kurt wrote to Don Farber that \u201cThis is to let you know that I have gone completely bonkers, and am sponsoring a softball team in Lafayette, Indiana.\u201d He asked Farber to send a check, \u201ccertain that this is a tax-deductible item.
