Her name was Emma.\nShe was born into a mansion teeming with servants, right next door to my father\u2019s childhood home, but she would die penniless in 1978, four years ago now, in a little shitbox she and I shared in the suburb of Midland City called Avondale.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe remembered seeing Father\u2019s childhood home burn down when she was nine years old, when Father was on his way to Vienna. But Father made a far greater impression on her than the fire when he came home from Vienna and looked over the carriage house with the idea of turning it into a studio.\nShe had her first glimpse of him through the privet hedge between the two properties.

Your name appeared on it for the first time today.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did it say about me?\u201d asked Haley, with a trace of anxiety.\n\u201cYou get up at 5 sharp, take a cold shower, brush your teeth for two minutes, pick up your pajamas and hang them on the hook inside the closet door; eat breakfast, go help with the haying; eat lunch, go out and hay some more; eat supper, listen to the radio for an hour, brush your teeth for two minutes, take a cold shower, hang up your clothes, and go to bed. Every minute\u2019s accounted for,\u201d said the General proudly. He looked again at the kitchen clock. \u201cH-hour,\u201d he announced, and D-squad marched out into the vermilion sunrise.\nBy 11 a.m., the wagon was stacked high with the day\u2019s sixth load of hay. The hay, the General had explained to Haley, had been pounded and bound into bales by a machine that had passed over the field the day before. The dense bundles were as high as Haley\u2019s chest, weighed about half of what he imagined Hope to weigh, and were as wide and thick as the General\u2019s middle. There was room for three more bales on top. Haley hung his baling hook on a wheel spoke, swept away the sweat that streamed into his eyes, and begged for a rest.\n\u201cYou just had a rest period, Haley,\u201d said the General. \u201cYou\u2019ll find you won\u2019t get tired as quickly if you keep at it steadily. Breaking up your rhythm with rest periods all the time, no wonder you\u2019re pooped. You\u2019ll never get your second wind that way.\u201d He was atop the load, reins in hand, with Hope seated beside him, her legs dangling over the side.\nHaley shook his head wearily and sat down on the ground, panting, wishing to Heaven that the nightmare of heat, creeping time, and lamed muscles would end. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right in a minute, I guess\u2014soon as I get my breath,\u201d he said. Mr. Banghart, who had been working on the opposite side of the wagon, walked over to him and told him to climb onto the wagon, that he would finish the load.\n\u201cLet him learn to pull his own weight, Mr. Banghart,\u201d warned the General. \u201cHe can do it. Come on, boy, three to go.\u201d\nLimply, painfully, Haley sank his hook into a nearby bale. He worried it along the ground to the wagon. Hope waited, hook poised, for him to swing it upward to where she could catch it and drag it into place.\n\u201cPut your back into it, boy,\u201d shouted the General, and Haley swung the bale. Hope made a grab for it, but missed, for it was a full yard beyond her hook. Haley staggered backward under the weight, his eyes and lungs filled with the dust and splinters that showered down from the bale. His feet tangled, and he fell hard on the sharp stubble, the bale on top of him.\nHe was yanked to his feet at once by Mr. Banghart, who, with his mouth close to Haley\u2019s ear, whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry\u2014we\u2019ll take care of that old devil when the right time comes.

Bad as his first taste of rural life had been, Haley found himself looking with pride at the results of their labor, stacked bales rising like skyscrapers on either side of them. Mr. Banghart sat still for only a minute, arising again to feel along the upper surface of a rafter until he found what he wanted, a flashlight. \u201cWe can show Haley our secret, can\u2019t we, Hope?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI suppose so. It\u2019s really kind of silly, though.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like very much to see it. I wouldn\u2019t tell anybody,\u201d Haley promised.\nThey led him down the corridor to within a few feet of the window at its end. The bales had been stacked here before Haley\u2019s arrival at Ardennes Farm. Mr. Banghart pointed his flashlight at a bale in the bottom row. \u201cNotice anything different about that one?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a piece of cloth tied around the baling wire,\u201d said Haley.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a marker,\u201d said Mr. Banghart. \u201cTry and move that one.\u201d\nHaley tugged at the bale dutifully. He was surprised to find that it slid from its place easily, that the bales above did not rest upon it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tunnel!\u201d Mr. Banghart announced happily. He dropped onto all fours, and crawled into the opening and out of sight.\n\u201cGo on in, Haley,\u201d said Hope. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d\nHaley followed Mr. Banghart into the dark passage, finding that there was barely room in which to squirm. After snaking his way through nine feet of the snug, airless tunnel, with claustrophobia beginning to give him twinges of panic, he found himself in a chamber in which he could stand, lighted by Mr. Banghart\u2019s flashlight. It was a room hollowed in the stacked bales, as long and wide as the sunroom couch, with a ceiling, resting on planks, that barely brushed the top of his head.", -0.0007407407407407363], "title":

Europe expended millions of her treasures, and the blood of two million of her people; and a handful of quarrelsome knights retained possession of Palestine for about one hundred years!\nMackay told us that the Children\u2019s Crusade started in 1213, when two monks got the idea of raising armies of children in Germany and France, and selling them in North Africa as slaves. Thirty thousand children volunteered, thinking they were going to Palestine. They were no doubt idle and deserted children who generally swarm in great cities, nurtured on vice and daring, said Mackay, and ready for anything.\nPope Innocent the Third thought they were going to Palestine, too, and he was thrilled. \u201cThese children are awake while we are asleep!\u201d he said.\nMost of the children were shipped out of Marseilles, and about half of them drowned in shipwrecks. The other half got to North Africa where they were sold.\nThrough a misunderstanding, some children reported for duty at Genoa, where no slave ships were waiting. They were fed and sheltered and questioned kindly by good people there\u2014then given a little money and a lot of advice and sent back home.\n\u201cHooray for the good people of Genoa,\u201d said Mary O\u2019Hare.\nI slept that night in one of the children\u2019s bedrooms. O\u2019Hare had put a book for me on the bedside table. It was Dresden, History, Stage and Gallery, by Mary Endell. It was published in 1908, and its introduction began:\nIt is hoped that this little book will make itself useful. It attempts to give to an English-reading public a bird\u2019s-eye view of how Dresden came to look as it does, architecturally; of how it expanded musically, through the genius of a few men, to its present bloom; and it calls attention to certain permanent landmarks in art that make its Gallery the resort of those seeking lasting impressions.\nI read some history further on:\nNow, in 1760, Dresden underwent siege by the Prussians. On the fifteenth of July began the cannonade. The Picture-Gallery took fire. Many of the paintings had been transported to the K\u00f6nigstein, but some were seriously injured by splinters of bombshells,\u2014notably Francia\u2019s \u201cBaptism of Christ.\u201d Furthermore, the stately Kreuzkirche tower, from which the enemy\u2019s movements had been watched day and night, stood in flames. It later succumbed. In sturdy contrast with the pitiful fate of the Kreuzkirche, stood the Frauenkirche, from the curves of whose stone dome the Prussian bombs rebounded like rain. Friederich was obliged finally to give up the siege, because he learned of the fall of Glatz, the critical point of his new conquests. \u201cWe must be off to Silesia, so that we do not lose everything.\u201d", 0.14061234464460273], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["skip", 0.17336558021776746], ["shelves", 0.17188094250548389], ["presents", 0.13070699687714302], ["museum", 0.12352183688502259], ["expensive", 0.06535349843857151], ["residua", 0.06535349843857151], ["shells", 0.06535349843857151], ["endoskeletons", 0.06535349843857151], ["exoskeletons", 0.06535349843857151], ["armadillo", 0.06535349843857151], ["plank", 0.06535349843857151], ["beaches", 0.06535349843857151], ["unicorn", 0.06535349843857151], ["tusk", 0.06535349843857151], ["driftwood", 0.06535349843857151], ["orts", 0.06535349843857151], ["armor", 0.06535349843857151], ["narwhal", 0.06535349843857151], ["cartilage", 0.06535349843857151], ["chiton", 0.06535349843857151], ["dottles", 0.06535349843857151], ["child", 0.058822288659507775], ["playfully", 0.057293647501827964], ["beautifully", 0.057293647501827964], ["dodo", 0.057293647501827964], ["specimens", 0.057293647501827964], ["mortal", 0.057293647501827964], ["coral", 0.057293647501827964], ["labeled", 0.0525789369424307], ["souls", 0.0525789369424307], ["motioned", 0.0525789369424307], ["adult", 0.0525789369424307], ["horn", 0.0525789369424307], ["science", 0.0525789369424307], ["presumably", 0.04923379656508441], ["woods", 0.04923379656508441], ["remains", 0.04923379656508441], ["stuffed", 0.04923379656508441], ["biology", 0.04923379656508441], ["complete", 0.04923379656508441], ["male", 0.04923379656508441], ["um", 0.04923379656508441], ["skeleton", 0.04663910410794244], ["extraordinarily", 0.04663910410794244], ["bone", 0.04663910410794244], ["paint", 0.04451908600568715], ["chairs", 0.04272663624025391], ["easily", 0.04272663624025391], ["chief", 0.04272663624025391], ["constant", 0.04153549055836323], ["wing", 0.04117394562834086], ["interested", 0.03980437544628989], ["suit", 0.037470995266497435], ["long", 0.03668254878796744], ["spiral", 0.0364592350689436], ["nodded", 0.03552850590994899], ["family", 0.03386454261180163], ["window", 0.03386454261180163], ["sat", 0.03311409469159731], ["written", 0.03240915722861551], ["empty", 0.03240915722861551], ["course", 0.030519402234455335], ["blue", 0.027468654973205442], ["wall", 0.02702981395014908], ["rumfoord", 0.0262627819277291], ["human", 0.026198895764310184], ["find", 0.025804691675058077], ["newport", 0.02505424375485376], ["feet", 0.02305598495338098]], "sentiment": ["He nodded at shelves that ran six feet up the window wall.

In the early days of radio, I remember, people living too close to the transmitter of KDKA in Pittsburgh used to receive soap operas in their bedsprings and bridgework.\nAnd nowadays, surely, TV is such a pervasive part of so many Americans\u2019 lives that they might as well be hearing Wolf Blitzer in their bedsprings and bridgework.

an interest in natural history had come there, on their way to the islands to see what Darwin had seen, to feel what Darwin had felt, that three cruise ships had their home port there, the newest of which was the Bah\u00eda de Darwin. There were several modern tourist hotels, the newest of which was the El Dorado, and there were souvenir shops and boutiques and restaurants for tourists all up and down the Calle Diez de Agosto.\nThe thing was, though: When James Wait got there, a worldwide financial crisis, a sudden revision of human opinions as to the value of money and stocks and bonds and mortgages and so on, bits of paper, had ruined the tourist business not only in Ecuador but practically everywhere. So that the El Dorado was the only hotel still open in Guayaquil, and the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was the only cruise ship still prepared to sail.\nThe El Dorado was staying open only as an assembly point for persons with tickets for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century,\u201d since it was owned by the same Ecuadorian company which owned the ship. But now, less than twenty-four hours before the cruise was to begin, there were only six guests, including James Wait, in the two-hundred-bed hotel. And the other five guests were:\n*Zenji Hiroguchi, twenty-nine, a Japanese computer genius;\nHisako Hiroguchi, twenty-six, his very pregnant wife, who was a teacher of ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging;\n*Andrew MacIntosh, fifty-five, an American financier and adventurer of great inherited wealth, a widower;\nSelena MacIntosh, eighteen, his congenitally blind daughter;\nAnd Mary Hepburn, fifty-one, an American widow from Ilium, New York, whom practically nobody in the hotel had seen because she had stayed in her room on the fifth floor, and had taken all her meals up there, since arriving all alone the night before.\nThe two with stars by their names would be dead before the sun went down. This convention of starring certain names will continue throughout my story, incidentally, alerting readers to the fact that some characters will shortly face the ultimate Darwinian test of strength

honoring all the friends and relatives he had lost in the massacre.\nYou could say that he became his own Turk over here, knocking himself down and spitting on himself. He could have studied English and become a respected teacher there in San Ignacio, and started writing poetry again, or maybe translated the Armenian poets he loved so much into English. But that wasn\u2019t humiliating enough. Nothing would do but that he, with all his education, become what his father and grandfather had been, which was a cobbler.\nHe was good at that craft, which he had learned as a boy, and which I would learn as a boy. But how he complained] At least he pitied himself in Armenian, which only Mother and I could understand. There weren\u2019t any other Armenians within a hundred miles of San Ignacio.\n\u201cI am looking for William Shakespeare, your greatest poet,\u201d he might say as he worked. \u201cHave you ever heard of him?\u201d He knew Shakespeare backwards and forwards in Armenian, and would often quote him. \u201cTo be or not to be \u2026\u201dfor example, as far as he was concerned, was, \u201cLinel kam chlinel \u2026\u201d\n\u201cTear out my tongue if you catch me speaking Armenian,\u201d he might say. That was the penalty the Turks set in the seventeenth century for speaking any language but Turkish: a ripped-out tongue.\n\u201cWho are those people and what am I doing here?\u201d he might say, with cowboys and Chinese and Indians passing by outside.\n\u201cWhen is San Ignacio going to erect a statue of Mesrob Mashtots?\u201d he might say. Mesrob Mashtots was the inventor of the Armenian alphabet, unlike any other, about four hundred years before the birth of Christ. Armenians, incidentally, were the first people to make Christianity their national religion.\n\u201cOne million, one million, one million,\u201d he might say. This is the generally accepted figure for the number of Armenians killed by the Turks in the massacre from which my parents escaped. That was two thirds of Turkey\u2019s Armenians, and about half the Armenians in the whole wide world. There are about six million of us now, including my two sons and three grandchildren, who know nothing and care nothing about Mesrob Mashtots.\n\u201cMusa Dagh!\u201d he might say. This was the name of a place in Turkey where a small band of Armenian civilians fought Turkish militiamen to a standstill for forty days and forty nights before being exterminated\u2014about the time my parents, with me in my mother\u2019s belly, arrived safe and sound in San Ignacio.\n\u201cThank you, Vartan Mamigonian,\u201d he might say. This was the name of a great Armenian national hero, who led a losing army against the Persians in the fifth century.

They are in fact babies. They are not movie stars. They are not Duke Wayne. And realizing that was the key, I was finally free to tell the truth. We were children and the subtitle of Slaughterhouse Five became The Children\u2019s Crusade.\nWhy had it taken me twenty-three years to write about what I had experienced in Dresden? We all came home with stories, and we all wanted to cash in, one way or another. And what Mary O\u2019Hare was saying, in effect, was, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell the truth for a change?\u201d\nErnest Hemingway wrote a story after the First World War called \u201cA Soldier\u2019s Home\u201d about how it was very rude to ask a soldier what he\u2019d seen when he got back home. I think a lot of people, including me, clammed up when a civilian asked about battle, about war. It was fashionable. One of the most impressive ways to tell your war story is to refuse to tell it, you know. Civilians would then have to imagine all kinds of deeds of derring-do.\nBut I think the Vietnam War freed me and other writers, because it made our leadership and our motives seem so scruffy and essentially stupid. We could finally talk about something bad that we did to the worst people imaginable, the Nazis. And what I saw, what I had to report, made war look so ugly. You know, the truth can be really powerful stuff. You\u2019re not expecting it.\nOf course, another reason not to talk about war is that it\u2019s unspeakable.\n3\nHere is a lesson in creative writing.\nFirst rule: Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you\u2019ve been to college.\nAnd I realize some of you may be having trouble deciding whether I am kidding or not.

Hamlet had one big edge on me. His father's ghost told him exactly what he had to do, while I am operating without instructions. But from somewhere something is trying to tell me where to go, what to do there, and why to do it. Don't worry, I don't hear voices. But there is this feeling that I have a destiny far away from the shallow and preposterous posing that is our life in New York. And I roam.\nAnd I roam.\nYoung Mushari was disappointed to read that Eliot did not hear voices. But the letter did end on a definitely cracked note. Eliot described the fire apparatus of Elsinore, as though Sylvia would be avid for such details.\nThey paint their fire engines here with orange and black stripes, like tigers. Very striking! They use detergent in their water, so that the water will soak right through wallboard to get at a fire. That certainly makes good sense, provided it doesn't harm the pumps and hoses. They haven't been using it long enough to really know. I told them they should write the pump manufacturer and tell him what they're doing, and they said they would. They think I am a very big volunteer fireman from back East. They are wonderful people. They aren't like the sparrowfarts and dancing masters who come tapping at the Rosewater Foundation's door. They're like the Americans I knew in the war.\nBe patient, Ophelia.\nLove,\nHamlet.\nEliot went from Elsinore to Vashti, Texas, and was soon arrested. He wandered up to the Vashti firehouse, covered with dust, needing a shave. He started talking to some idlers there about how the government ought to divide up the wealth of the country equally, instead of some people having more than they could ever use, and others having nothing.\nHe rambled on, said such things as, \"You know, I think the main purpose of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps is to get poor Americans into clean, pressed, unpatched clothes, so rich Americans can stand to look at them.\" He mentioned a revolution, too. He thought there might be one in about twenty years, and he thought it would be a good one, provided infantry veterans and volunteer firemen led it.\nHe was thrown in jail as a suspicious character. They let him go after a mystifying series of questions and answers.

December fifteenth the wife of Colin Jarvis, called Ma, led a delegation of twenty other strikers\u2019 wives to the main gate of the factory, asking to see Daniel McCone. He sent Alexander down to them with a scribbled note, which Alexander found himself able to read out loud to them without any speech impediment at all. It said that Daniel McCone was too busy to give time to strangers who had nothing to do with affairs of the Cuyahoga Bridge and Iron Company anymore. It suggested that they had mistaken the company for a charitable organization. It said that their churches or police precinct stations would be able to give them a list of organizations to which they might more appropriately plead for help\u2014if they really needed help and felt that they deserved it.\nMa Jarvis told Alexander that her own message was even simpler: The strikers would return to work on any terms. Most of them were now being evicted from their homes and had no place to go.\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI can only read my father\u2019s note again, if you would like me to.\u201d\nAlexander McCone would say many years later that the confrontation did not bother him a bit at the time. He was in fact elated, he said, to find himself such a reliable \u201c\u2026 muh-muh-muh-machine.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA police captain now stepped forward. He warned the women that they were in violation of the law, assembling in such great numbers as to impede traffic and constitute a threat to public safety. He ordered them to disperse at once, in the name of the law.\nThis they did. They retreated across the vast plaza before the main gate. The fa\u00e7ade of the factory had been designed to remind cultivated persons of the Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy. The factory\u2019s clock-tower was a half-scale replica of San Marco\u2019s famous campanile.\nIt was from the belfry of that tower that Alexander and his father and his brother would watch the Cuyahoga Massacre on Christmas morning. Each would have his own binoculars. Each would have his own little revolver, too.\nThere were no bells in the belfry. Neither were there caf\u00e9s and shops around the plaza below. The architect had justified the plaza on strictly utilitarian grounds. It provided any amount of room for wagons and buggies and horse-drawn streetcars as they came and went. The architect had also been matter-of-fact about the virtues of the factory as a fort. Any mob meaning to storm the front gate would first have to cross all that open ground.", 0.25384259259259256], "title": "Jailbird"}, "petrified-ants": {"tfidf": [["short", 0.09212378203352957], ["early", 0.0870879724875362], ["vonnegut", 0.07972691807162903], ["birdie", 0.0720707462613079], ["stories", 0.0720707462613079], ["unpublished", 0.061415854689019715], ["classic", 0.05638004514302635], ["hardcover", 0.05638004514302635], ["featured", 0.05638004514302635], ["perceptive", 0.05638004514302635], ["ascent", 0.05638004514302635], ["landscape", 0.05638004514302635], ["stardom", 0.05638004514302635], ["20", 0.05638004514302635], ["provide", 0.05638004514302635], ["unparalleled", 0.05638004514302635], ["editions", 0.05638004514302635], ["satirist", 0.05638004514302635], ["ebook", 0.05638004514302635], ["unimitative", 0.05638004514302635], ["startlingly", 0.05638004514302635], ["international", 0.05638004514302635], ["inimitable", 0.05638004514302635], ["change", 0.05638004514302635], ["fourteen", 0.05638004514302635], ["forever", 0.05638004514302635], ["sinister", 0.05638004514302635], ["harper", 0.05638004514302635], ["points", 0.05638004514302635], ["social", 0.05638004514302635], ["mind", 0.0435439862437681], ["vintage", 0.0435439862437681], ["frequently", 0.0435439862437681], ["america", 0.0435439862437681], ["ruefully", 0.0435439862437681], ["american", 0.0435439862437681], ["2009", 0.0435439862437681], ["published", 0.0435439862437681], ["literary", 0.03603537313065395], ["october", 0.03603537313065395], ["began", 0.030707927344509858], ["master", 0.030707927344509858], ["fiction", 0.02657563935720968], ["kurt", 0.02657563935720968], ["man", 0.023199314231395703], ["years", 0.020344672012372403]], "sentiment": ["Early, unpublished short stories by America\u2019s\n\u201cunimitative and inimitable social satirist\u201d *\nKurt Vonnegut\nLOOK AT THE BIRDIE\nUNPUBLISHED SHORT FICTION\nAvailable in hardcover and eBook editions\nOctober 20, 2009\nFrequently startlingly perceptive, at points ruefully sinister, always vintage Vonnegut, the fourteen never-before-published short stories featured in Look at the Birdie date from the years before this American master began his ascent to international stardom and provide an unparalleled look into the early mind of the man who would go on to change the literary landscape forever.\n* Harper\u2019s\nCLASSIC VONNEGUT", -0.007692307692307697], "title": "Petrified Ants"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["jonah", 0.3924385830568317], ["appointed", 0.19621929152841586], ["ago", 0.18677161617125299], ["john", 0.17231766461255568], ["000", 0.15833610916055002], ["younger", 0.14841603769669554], ["ended", 0.14072143247896413], ["collect", 0.09810964576420793], ["unlucky", 0.09810964576420793], ["motives", 0.09810964576420793], ["parents", 0.09810964576420793], ["conveyances", 0.09810964576420793], ["factual", 0.09810964576420793], ["sam", 0.08615883230627784], ["250", 0.08615883230627784], ["1", 0.08615883230627784], ["conventional", 0.08615883230627784], ["material", 0.08615883230627784], ["quarts", 0.08615883230627784], ["plan", 0.08615883230627784], ["126", 0.08615883230627784], ["127", 0.08615883230627784], ["cigarettes", 0.08615883230627784], ["fail", 0.07916805458027501], ["bizarre", 0.07916805458027501], ["pipes", 0.07916805458027501], ["compelled", 0.07916805458027501], ["wives", 0.07916805458027501], ["soft", 0.07916805458027501], ["3", 0.07420801884834777], ["booze", 0.07420801884834777], ["called", 0.07170488074758054], ["provided", 0.07036071623948206], ["book", 0.06495506774323243], ["listen", 0.06455947078049563], ["began", 0.06455947078049563], ["day", 0.06345558112462076], ["second", 0.060226463396342085], ["places", 0.05526642766441483], ["play", 0.05260865732256555], ["place", 0.05141912505554914], ["call", 0.04645908932362188], ["times", 0.04128487221240916], ["man", 0.037766882903085185]], "sentiment": ["126 SOFT PIPES, PLAY ON\n127 THE END\n1\nTHE DAY THE WORLD ENDED\nCALL ME JONAH.

This was the name of a Roman emperor who had a sculptor make a hollow, life-size iron bull with a door on it. The door could be locked from the outside. The bull\u2019s mouth was open. That was the only other opening to the outside.\nHeliogabalus would have a human being put into the bull through the door, and the door would be locked. Any sounds the human being made in there would come out of the mouth of the bull. Heliogabalus would have guests in for a nice party, with plenty of food and wine and beautiful women and pretty boys\u2014and Heliogabalus would have a servant light kindling.

But did I cry? No.\nI said, \u201cA funny thing happened on the way down the birth canal, Doc. A bum came up to me and said he hadn\u2019t had a bite for three days. So I bit him!\u201d\nBut seriously, my fellow Hoosiers, there\u2019s good news and bad news tonight. This is the best of times and the worst of times. So what else is new?\nThe bad news is that the Martians have landed in Manhattan, and have checked in at the Waldorf-Astoria. The good news is that they only eat homeless people of all colors, and they pee gasoline.\nAm I religious? I practice a disorganized religion. I belong to an unholy disorder. We call ourselves \u201cOur Lady of Perpetual Consternation.\u201d We are as celibate as fifty percent of the heterosexual Roman Catholic clergy.\nActually\u2014and when I hold up my right hand like this, it means I\u2019m not kidding, that I give my Word of Honor that what I\u2019m about to say is true. So actually, I am honorary President of the American Humanist Society, having succeeded the late, great science fiction writer Isaac Asimov in that utterly functionless capacity. We Humanists behave as well as we can, without any expectation of rewards or punishments in an Afterlife. We serve as best we can the only abstraction with which we have any real familiarity, which is our community.\nWe don\u2019t fear death, and neither should you. You know what Socrates said about death, in Greek, of course? \u201cDeath is just one more night.\u201d\nAs a Humanist, I love science. I hate superstition, which could never have given us A-bombs.\nI love science, and not only because it has given us the means to trash the planet, and I don\u2019t like it here. It has found the answers to two of our biggest questions: How did the Universe begin, and how did we and all other animals get the wonderful bodies we have, with eyes and brains and kidneys and so on?\nOK. So science sent the Hubble telescope out into space, so it could capture light and the absence thereof, from the very beginning of time. And the telescope really did that. So now we know that there was once absolutely nothing, such a perfect nothing that there wasn\u2019t even nothing or once. Can you imagine that?
