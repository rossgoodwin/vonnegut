I am taller than he was, but I know as did he what it was like to be a Corporal, and then to be ousted from scenes of triumphs in later years. My own Corporalcy was a brevet rank, awarded shortly before my discharge. I don\u2019t know about his. His quarters on Elba were reasonably comfortable, as are mine in Northampton\u2014and he too must have received well made and tasteful gifts like yours from those who still thought well of him. Smoke and flames in my face from a fire possibly but not certainly caused by my own careless disposal of smoking materials were my own Waterloo. In any case, Napoleon was humbled, and so am I. Come see me! I have a guestroom with its own sanitary facilities indoors. Do you suppose Napoleon had to use a privy out back?\nSmith College is only two thousand yards from here, and I expect to teach \u201ccreative writing\u201d there next fall. Can do! I will not do there what I did when in exile in Iowa City in 1965, which was to interfere with a student\u2019s clothing.\nI have been asked by New American Library to write a preface for their popular volume containing The Scarlet Letter, The Red Badge of Courage, Billy Budd, and Huckleberry Finn. Before setting to work, I intend to read all four of those. What I have already read is Oscar Wilde\u2019s De Profundis, which knocked my effing block off.\nThank you so much, dearest of old friends.\nKurt\nAugust 6, 2000\nSagaponack, NY\nTO ROBERT MASLANSKY\nDear Bob\u2014", 0.08802308802308802], "title": "Letters"}}
