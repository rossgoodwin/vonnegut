But then, after all the others had got out, I got out, too\u2014to stretch my legs. I strolled into the old part of the cemetery, which had been all filled up, by and large, before I was born. I stationed myself at the foot of the most imposing monument in the bone orchard, a sixty-two-foot gray marble obelisk with a stone football on top. It celebrated George Hick-man Bannister, a seventeen-year-old whose peephole was closed while he was playing high school football on the morning of Thanksgiving in 1924. He was from a poor family, but thousands of people had seen him die, our parents not among them\u2014and many of them had chipped in to buy him the obelisk.\nOur parents had no interest in sports.\nMaybe twenty feet away from the obelisk was the most fanciful marker in the cemetery, a radial, air-cooled airplane engine reproduced in pink marble, and fitted with a bronze propeller. This was the headstone of Will Fairchild, the World War One ace in the Lafayette Escadrille, after whom the airport was named. He hadn\u2019t died in the war. He\u2019 had crashed and burned, again with thousands watching, in 1922, while stunt flying at the Midland County Fair.\nHe was the last of the Fairchilds, a pioneering family after which so much in the city was named. He had failed to reproduce before his peephole closed.\nInscribed in the bronze propeller were his name and dates, and the euphemism fliers in the Lafayette Escadrille used for death in an airplane in wartime: \u201cGone West.\u201d", 0.16313319530710838], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["potapov", 0.26300578849235484], ["farthest", 0.2193918773396262], ["twisted", 0.2193918773396262], ["flown", 0.2193918773396262], ["kidnaped", 0.2193918773396262], ["communist", 0.16394010289483057], ["iona", 0.1550143608422622], ["asked", 0.14991032166771442], ["kraft", 0.14777686190114153], ["wall", 0.14155547137741367], ["moscow", 0.14155547137741367], ["picked", 0.13621421567243278], ["sat", 0.13150289424617742], ["colonel", 0.13150289424617742], ["mexico", 0.12347606642769139], ["stood", 0.12347606642769139], ["magazine", 0.12347606642769139], ["trial", 0.11382958415501586], ["agent", 0.10606334357737757], ["city", 0.10161431817296858], ["heard", 0.09063684434489817], ["resi", 0.0613421285963691]], "sentiment": ["\u201cOh,\u201d said Kraft.

I am certainly more dependent on you\u2014and on Nanny, too\u2014than you will ever be on me.\nThere is a screening of Slaughterhouse late this afternoon\u2014for college people. I will be there to run a discussion afterwards. There will be no big premiere. The thing simply starts running at a theater three blocks from here on Wednesday, at noon.\nI was going to let my lease here run out in a month. But I\u2019ll renew it now, since I can\u2019t think of anyplace else to go. The landlord, who is an architect, is going to bust through a new front door, so people don\u2019t come in through the kitchen any more, and he\u2019s going to cut a door through from the bedroom to the bathroom. That will close up two doors in the kitchen, making room for lots more counter space. It will be a really classy kitchen when he gets through, and I\u2019m getting deeper into the cooking thing, so I\u2019ll appreciate that.\nMy old war buddy, BV O\u2019Hare, will be coming to New York to see the movie on Thursday. That will be a great adventure for me\u2014watching him get his mind blown by a nearly perfect recreation of the past.\nI am at last finishing up another book. That\u2019s what I do all the time now. Sure is a slow process, as you know. If I can ever help you with opinions on your book, I hope you\u2019ll use me. As a teacher, I was usually pretty good at helping people become what they wanted to become. I didn\u2019t try to make them resemble me.\nMartha Friedman would be most affectionately pleased if you were ever to ask her for advice or information on the profession you propose to enter.
