Not just male writers, but male artists of every sort, are no longer pressured to prove that they are real men, even though they have artistic sensibilities. As I\u2019ve said elsewhere, my father was a gun nut like Ernest Hemingway, mainly to prove that he wasn\u2019t effeminate, even though he was an architect and a painter.
