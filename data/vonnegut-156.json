He told the butler to give me a pousse-caf\u00e9 without further ado.\nHe and Ubriaco went into the library, and the rest of us entered the living room, which had a swimming pool. I had never seen a living room with a swimming pool before. I had heard of such a thing, of course, but hearing of and actually seeing that much water in a living room are two very different things.\nI knelt by the pool and swirled my hand in the water, curious about the temperature, which was soupy. When I withdrew my hand and considered its wetness, I had to admit to myself that the wet was undreamlike. My hand was really wet and would remain so for some time, unless I did something about it.\nAll this was really going on. As I stood, the butler arrived with my pousse-caf\u00e9.\nOutrageous behavior was not the answer. I was going to have to start paying attention again. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said to the butler.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sir,\u201d he replied.\nClewes and Edel were seated at one end of a couch about half a block long. I joined them, wanting their appreciation for how sedate I had become.\nThey were continuing to speculate as to when Mrs. Graham might have caught them behaving so virtuously.\nClewes mourned that he had not had many opportunities to be virtuous, selling advertising matchbooks and calendars from door to door. \u201cAbout the best I can do is let a building custodian tell me his war stories,\u201d he said. He remembered a custodian in the Flatiron Building who claimed to have been the first American to cross the bridge over the Rhine at Remagen, Germany, during World War Two. The capture of this bridge had been an immense event, allowing the Allied Armies to pour at high speed disguised as a man, though. \u201cI sometimes think that the custodian could have been Mrs. Jack Graham, though.", 0.09373333333333335], "title": "Jailbird"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["faceless", 0.07252130149312451], ["splendid", 0.07252130149312451], ["dry", 0.0662550249364051], ["searchlights", 0.0583456590586973], ["wept", 0.0583456590586973], ["bowls", 0.051754360687523225], ["civilization", 0.049401824470827034], ["image", 0.049401824470827034], ["blank", 0.04741278344079789], ["unk", 0.045399757691169246], ["fountain", 0.042810526099652954], ["imagined", 0.04158071732798425], ["easy", 0.04045798988295677], ["remarkable", 0.036260650746562255], ["eluded", 0.036260650746562255], ["lapsed", 0.036260650746562255], ["everbody", 0.036260650746562255], ["abraded", 0.036260650746562255], ["skillfully", 0.036260650746562255], ["cycling", 0.036260650746562255], ["nameless", 0.036260650746562255], ["majestic", 0.036260650746562255], ["flourishing", 0.036260650746562255], ["abstractions", 0.036260650746562255], ["artifacts", 0.036260650746562255], ["families", 0.036260650746562255], ["reverie", 0.036260650746562255], ["clicking", 0.036260650746562255], ["hopes", 0.036260650746562255], ["whirring", 0.036260650746562255], ["flourish", 0.036260650746562255], ["wouldn", 0.03596370995691527], ["beautiful", 0.035226182036399815], ["giant", 0.03178873345262713], ["descending", 0.03178873345262713], ["swept", 0.03178873345262713], ["dense", 0.03178873345262713], ["passion", 0.03178873345262713], ["increasing", 0.03178873345262713], ["nervously", 0.03178873345262713], ["buzzing", 0.03178873345262713], ["hits", 0.03178873345262713], ["diameters", 0.03178873345262713], ["tingled", 0.03178873345262713], ["sophisticated", 0.03178873345262713], ["beckoned", 0.03178873345262713], ["fingertips", 0.03178873345262713], ["imagination", 0.03178873345262713], ["cone", 0.03178873345262713], ["ideal", 0.03178873345262713], ["stupendous", 0.03178873345262713], ["furnish", 0.03178873345262713], ["produced", 0.02917282952934865], ["nests", 0.02917282952934865], ["hazards", 0.02917282952934865], ["oily", 0.02917282952934865], ["avoiding", 0.02917282952934865], ["woke", 0.02917282952934865], ["fashion", 0.02917282952934865], ["skyscrapers", 0.02917282952934865], ["bones", 0.02917282952934865], ["wake", 0.02917282952934865], ["sensing", 0.02917282952934865], ["weeks", 0.027316816158691998], ["seeking", 0.027316816158691998], ["cooed", 0.027316816158691998], ["apt", 0.027316816158691998], ["girls", 0.027316816158691998], ["flashed", 0.027316816158691998], ["crystals", 0.027316816158691998], ["rattled", 0.025877180343761613], ["ruins", 0.025877180343761613], ["bone", 0.025877180343761613], ["bore", 0.025877180343761613], ["faces", 0.025877180343761613], ["quietly", 0.025877180343761613], ["mauser", 0.025877180343761613], ["weeping", 0.025877180343761613], ["lives", 0.025877180343761613], ["equipment", 0.025877180343761613], ["friends", 0.024700912235413517], ["landing", 0.024700912235413517], ["asleep", 0.024700912235413517], ["forest", 0.024700912235413517], ["playing", 0.024700912235413517], ["porthole", 0.023706391720398946], ["respect", 0.023706391720398946], ["described", 0.023706391720398946], ["sides", 0.023706391720398946], ["town", 0.023706391720398946], ["mistake", 0.023706391720398946], ["buildings", 0.022844898864756866], ["friendship", 0.022844898864756866], ["climb", 0.022844898864756866], ["birds", 0.022085008312135036], ["surely", 0.022085008312135036], ["names", 0.022085008312135036], ["stay", 0.022085008312135036], ["controlled", 0.022085008312135036], ["boaz", 0.021537511575944808], ["navigator", 0.020790358663992124], ["truth", 0.020228994941478385], ["rifle", 0.019712590375842668], ["family", 0.018789359126548], ["pilot", 0.018789359126548], ["talking", 0.018372981570821734], ["filled", 0.017981854978457636], ["play", 0.017981854978457636], ["stevenson", 0.017613091018199908], ["wife", 0.017613091018199908], ["memory", 0.017264270235811032], ["standing", 0.016933345755891345], ["stony", 0.016318441370056995], ["bee", 0.015493709940960962], ["blue", 0.015240673081907534], ["father", 0.014762557132528683], ["love", 0.01453616152084307], ["friend", 0.01453616152084307], ["white", 0.014105894588593572], ["place", 0.012624769158629057], ["son", 0.012461428461956216], ["eyes", 0.010894033761244027], ["long", 0.010176449018597418], ["things", 0.010176449018597418], ["people", 0.01006424422690794], ["head", 0.009530749285971725], ["chrono", 0.008851004023663168], ["going", 0.008320435647940768], ["malachi", 0.008236099637828814], ["three", 0.008070664601613733], ["ship", 0.007989511168021086], ["man", 0.006680215400300504], ["constant", 0.0057613744968052225]], "sentiment": ["It was easy to believe that the searchlights were playing over a sophisticated civilization indeed.

He would not say a word, and would soon go home again. And one person there wasn\u2019t a painter at all, as far as we knew. He was a tailor. His name was Isadore Finkelstein, and his shop was right above the tavern. After a couple of drinks, he could talk painting as well as anyone. His grandfather, he said, had been a tailor in Vienna, and had made several suits for the painter Gustav Klimt before the First World War.\nAnd we got on the subject of why, even though we had been given shows which had excited some critics, and which had inspired a big story in Life magazine about Pollock, we still weren\u2019t making anywhere near enough to live on.\nWe concluded that it was our clothing and grooming which were holding us back. This was a kind of joke. Everything we said was a kind of joke. I still don\u2019t understand how things got so gruesomely serious for Pollock and Kitchen after only six more years went by.\nSlazinger was there, too. That was where I met him. He was gathering material for a novel about painters\u2014one of dozens of novels he never wrote.\nAt the end of that evening, I remember, he said to me: \u201cI can\u2019t get over how passionate you guys are, and yet so absolutely unserious.\u201d\n\u201cEverything about life is a joke,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\nFinkelstein declared himself eager to solve the clothing problem of anybody who thought he had one. He would do it for a small down payment and a manageable installment plan. So the next thing I knew, Painters X, Y and Z and I and Kitchen were all upstairs in Finkelstein\u2019s shop, getting measured for suits. Pollock and Slazinger came along, but only as spectators. Nobody else had any money, so, in character, I made everybody\u2019s down payment with the traveler\u2019s checks I had left over from my trip to Florence.\nPainters X, Y and Z, incidentally, would pay me back with pictures the very next afternoon. Painter X had a key to our apartment, which I had given him after he was thrown out of his fleabag hotel for setting his bed on fire.

him were being baked out forever. He was riding home on a bus from his job as a linoleum salesman in a department store. The day marked the end of his seventh year of marriage to Madelaine, who had the car, and who, in fact, owned it. He carried red roses in a long green box under his arm.\nThe bus was crowded, but no women were standing, so Lowell\u2019s conscience was unencumbered. He sat back in his seat and crackled his knuckles absently, and thought pleasant things about his wife.\nHe was a tall, straight man, with a thin, sandy mustache and a longing to be a British colonel. At a distance, it appeared that his longing had been answered in every respect save for a uniform. He seemed distinguished and purposeful. But his eyes were those of a wistful panhandler, lost, baffled, inordinately agreeable. He was intelligent and healthy, but decent to a point that crippled him as master of his home or an accumulator of wealth.\nMadelaine had once characterized him as standing on the edge of the mainstream of life, smiling and saying, \u201cPardon me,\u201d \u201cAfter you,\u201d and \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\nMadelaine was a real estate saleswoman, and made far more money than Lowell did. Sometimes she joked with him about it. He could only smile amiably, and say that he had never, at any rate, made any enemies, and that, after all, God had made him, even as he had made Madelaine\u2014presumably with some good end in mind.\nMadelaine was a beautiful woman, and Lowell had never loved anyone else. He would have been lost without her. Some days, as he rode home on the bus, he felt dull and ineffectual, tired, and afraid Madelaine would leave him\u2014and not blaming her for wanting to.\nThis day, however, wasn\u2019t one of them. He felt marvelous. It was, in addition to being his wedding anniversary, a day spiced with mystery. The mystery was in no way ominous, as far as Lowell could see, but it was puzzling enough to make him feel as though he were involved in a small adventure. It would give him and Madelaine a few minutes of titillating speculation. While he\u2019d been waiting for the bus, someone had thrown a paper knife to him.\nIt had come, he thought, from a passing car or from one of the offices in the building across the street. He hadn\u2019t seen it until it clattered to the sidewalk by the pointed black toes of his shoes. He\u2019d glanced around quickly without seeing who\u2019d thrown it; had picked it up gingerly, and found that it was warm and remarkably light. It was bluish silver in color, oval in cross section, and very modern in design. It was a single piece of metal, seemingly hollow, sharply pointed at one end and blunt at the other, with only a small, pearl-like stone at its midpoint to mark off the hilt from the blade.\nLowell had identified it instantly as a paper knife because he had often noticed something like it in a cutlery window he passed every day on his way to and from the bus stop downtown. He\u2019d made an effort to locate the knife\u2019s owner by holding it over his head, and looking from car to car and from office window to office window, but no one had looked back at him as though to claim it. So he had put it in his pocket.\nLowell looked out of the bus window, and saw that the bus was going down the quiet, elm-shaded boulevard on which he and Madelaine lived. The mansions on either side, though now divided into expensive apartments, were still mansions outside, magnificent. Without Madelaine\u2019s income, it would have been impossible for them to live in such a place.", 0.08194319569319568], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["senator", 0.18025416348585804], ["lamprey", 0.15026840913673026], ["codpieces", 0.07513420456836513], ["shaft", 0.07513420456836513], ["creature", 0.07513420456836513], ["snopes", 0.06563903771137958], ["lampreys", 0.06563903771137958], ["hoobler", 0.06563903771137958], ["sheriff", 0.056143870854394026], ["ate", 0.056143870854394026], ["mustard", 0.05308710987748705], ["cut", 0.05058955430496712], ["grace", 0.05058955430496712], ["fuck", 0.04503523775554021], ["space", 0.0435919430205015], ["tore", 0.037567102284182564], ["dreading", 0.037567102284182564], ["cried", 0.037567102284182564], ["ships", 0.037567102284182564], ["joyful", 0.037567102284182564], ["fate", 0.037567102284182564], ["screaming", 0.037567102284182564], ["interviewing", 0.037567102284182564], ["eliminate", 0.037567102284182564], ["brokenly", 0.037567102284182564], ["lakes", 0.037567102284182564], ["represented", 0.037567102284182564], ["squirming", 0.037567102284182564], ["rushed", 0.037567102284182564], ["screamed", 0.037567102284182564], ["noxious", 0.037567102284182564], ["codpiece", 0.037567102284182564], ["ooze", 0.037567102284182564], ["stumbled", 0.037567102284182564], ["heraldry", 0.037567102284182564], ["unbeknownst", 0.037567102284182564], ["bloodworm", 0.037567102284182564], ["hear", 0.03632306286896492], ["asked", 0.03358868489960129], ["rocket", 0.03281951885568979], ["bore", 0.03281951885568979], ["bird", 0.03281951885568979], ["customarily", 0.03281951885568979], ["heartbreaking", 0.03281951885568979], ["explained", 0.03281951885568979], ["ironical", 0.03281951885568979], ["thick", 0.03281951885568979], ["countdown", 0.03281951885568979], ["embroidered", 0.03281951885568979], ["sobbing", 0.03281951885568979], ["big", 0.032182229007691854], ["wet", 0.030042360580976337], ["confederacy", 0.030042360580976337], ["eagle", 0.030042360580976337], ["led", 0.030042360580976337], ["reminded", 0.030042360580976337], ["bald", 0.030042360580976337], ["mouth", 0.030042360580976337], ["horrible", 0.028071935427197013], ["campaign", 0.028071935427197013], ["dwayne", 0.028071935427197013], ["vile", 0.028071935427197013], ["cruel", 0.028071935427197013], ["fashion", 0.028071935427197013], ["finding", 0.028071935427197013], ["bars", 0.026543554938743524], ["houses", 0.026543554938743524], ["clarke", 0.026543554938743524], ["mankind", 0.026543554938743524], ["shape", 0.02529477715248356], ["wearing", 0.02529477715248356], ["national", 0.02529477715248356], ["duty", 0.02529477715248356], ["night", 0.024948428593986417], ["deliver", 0.02423895057832426], ["continued", 0.023324351998704237], ["watching", 0.023324351998704237], ["conversation", 0.023324351998704237], ["area", 0.023324351998704237], ["voice", 0.023324351998704237], ["land", 0.023324351998704237], ["hadn", 0.022517618877770106], ["report", 0.022517618877770106], ["arthur", 0.022517618877770106], ["stars", 0.022517618877770106], ["story", 0.022392456599734194], ["carry", 0.02179597151025075], ["stand", 0.021143162059536195], ["weren", 0.019998956000199436], ["modern", 0.019998956000199436], ["honor", 0.01949136714983148], ["letters", 0.01901881323553729], ["television", 0.018576768570211462], ["reading", 0.01816153143448246], ["eyes", 0.01816153143448246], ["beings", 0.017399712015919278], ["question", 0.01704838808175797], ["general", 0.01704838808175797], ["true", 0.016714208875118028], ["news", 0.016395578631043416], ["care", 0.016395578631043416], ["supposed", 0.016091114503845927], ["set", 0.016091114503845927], ["close", 0.016091114503845927], ["named", 0.014992877174563877], ["men", 0.014271229807044518], ["interviewer", 0.014271229807044518], ["better", 0.014046641979489786], ["history", 0.013215403232885213], ["friends", 0.013215403232885213], ["country", 0.013022452020784555], ["left", 0.012834787814016646], ["times", 0.0126521285874265], ["human", 0.011647995202550642], ["told", 0.011196228299867097], ["long", 0.01011961471409715], ["great", 0.009755848787289285], ["man", 0.009523646378551742], ["good", 0.006521900276283555]], "sentiment": ["The man who was interviewing Senator Snopes asked him to stand up so everybody could get a good look at his codpiece, which the Senator did. Codpieces were very much in fashion, and many men were wearing codpieces in the shape of rocket ships, in honor of the Big Space Fuck. These customarily had the letters \u201cU.S.A.\u201d embroidered on the shaft. Senator Snopes\u2019 shaft, however, bore the Stars and Bars of the Confederacy.\nThis led the conversation into the area of heraldry in general, and the interviewer reminded the Senator of his campaign to eliminate the bald eagle as the national bird. The Senator explained that he didn\u2019t like to have his country represented by a creature that obviously hadn\u2019t been able to cut the mustard in modern times.\nAsked to name a creature that had been able to cut the mustard, the Senator did better than that: he named two\u2014the lamprey and the bloodworm. And, unbeknownst to him or to anybody, lampreys were finding the Great Lakes too vile and noxious even for them. While all the human beings were in their houses, watching the Big Space Fuck, lampreys were squirming out of the ooze and onto land. Some of them were nearly as long and thick as the Arthur C. Clarke.\nAnd Grace Hoobler tore her wet eyes from what she had been reading, and she asked the sheriff the question he had been dreading to hear: \u201cWhat made her do this to us?\u201d\nThe sheriff told her, and then he cried out against cruel Fate, too. \u201cThis is the most horrible duty I ever had to carry out\u2014\u201d he said brokenly, \u201cto deliver news this heartbreaking to friends as close as you two are\u2014on a night that\u2019s supposed to be the most joyful night in the history of mankind.\u201d\nHe left sobbing, and stumbled right into the mouth of a lamprey. The lamprey ate him immediately, but not before he screamed.

I think any form of government, not just Capitalism, is whatever the people who have all our money, drunk or sober, sane or insane, decide to do today.\nWARDEN MATSUMOTO WAS an odd duck. Many of his quirks were no doubt a consequence of his having had an atomic bomb dropped on him in childhood. The buildings and trees and bridges and so on which had seemed so substantial vanished like fantasies.\nAs I\u2019ve said, Hiroshima was suddenly a blank tableland with little dust devils spinning here and there.\nAfter the flash, little Hiroshi Matsumoto was the only real thing on the table. He began a long, long walk in search of anything else that was also real. When he reached the edge of the city, he found himself among structures and creatures both real and fantastic, living people with their skins hanging on their exposed muscles and bones like draperies, and so on.\nThese images about the bombing are all his, by the way. But I wouldn\u2019t hear them from him until I had been teaching at the prison and living next door to him by the lake for 2 long years.\nWHATEVER ELSE BEING atom-bombed had done to him, it had not destroyed his conscience. He had hated turning away poor people from the emergency room at the hospital-for-profit he ran in Louisville. After he took over the prison-for-profit at Athena, he thought there ought to be some sort of educational program there, even though his corporation\u2019s contract with New York State required him to keep the prisoners from escaping and nothing more.\nHE WORKED FOR Sony. He never worked for anybody but Sony.\n\u201cNEW YORK STATE,\u201d he said, \u201cdoes not believe that education can rehabilitate the sort of criminal who ends up at Athena or Attica or Sing Sing.\u201d Attica and Sing Sing were for Hispanics and Whites respectively, who, like the inmates at Athena, had been convicted of at least 1 murder and 2 other violent crimes. The other 2 were likely to be murders, too.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, either,\u201d he said. \u201cI do know this, though: 10 percent of the people inside these walls still have minds, but there is nothing for those minds to play with. So this place is twice as painful for them as it is for the rest. A good teacher just might be able to give their minds new toys, Math or Astronomy or History, or who knows what, which would make the passage of time just a little bit more bearable.

My own brother came home from New York City\u2014bombed on Darvon and Ritalin and methaqualone and Valium, and God only knows what all. He had prescriptions for every bit of it. He said he was home to discover his roots, but, after I heard about all the pills he was taking, I thought he would be lucky to find his own behind with both hands. I thought it was a miracle that he had even found the right exit off the Interstate.\nAs it was, he had an accident on his way home\u2014in a brand new white Rolls-Royce convertible. The car itself was drug-inspired madness. The day after he was fired and his fourth wife walked out on him, he bought a seventy-thousand-dollar motorcar.\nHe loaded it up like a truck with his buttonless wardrobe, and took off for Midland City. And when he first got home, his conversation, if you could call it that, was repetitious, obsessed. There were only two things he wanted to do: One was to find his roots, and the other was to find some woman who would sew all his buttons back on. The only buttons he had were on the clothes on his back. He had been particularly vulnerable to an attack on his buttons, too, since his suits and coats were made in London, with buttons instead of zippers on their flies, and with buttons at the wrists which actually buttoned and unbuttoned. He put on one of his buttonless coats for Mother and me, and those floppy cuffs made him look like a pirate in Peter Pan.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere was a big dent in the left front fender of that brand new Rolls-Royce, and a crease and a sort of chalky blue stripe that ran back from the dent and across the left-hand door.

were lighthearted, unhaunted by ambition as they sauntered along the factory street to the main gate, outside of which was the Acme Grille. It had been made clear to both of them that they didn\u2019t have the priceless stuff of which executives were made. So, unlike so many wide-eyed and hustling men all around them, they were free to dress comfortably and inexpensively, and go out for coffee as often as they pleased.\nThey also had a field of humor that was closed to those with big futures in the organization. They could make jokes about the American Forge and Foundry Company, its products, its executives, and its stockholders.\nCarmody, who was forty-five, was theoretically in charge of the section, of young Sterling, Miss Daily, and the files. But he was spiritually an anarchist, and never gave orders. He was a tall, thin dreamer, who prided himself on being creative rather than domineering, and his energies went into stuffing the suggestion box, decorating the office for holidays, and collecting limericks, which he kept in a locked file in his desk.\nCarmody had been lonely and a little sour, as wave after wave of enterprising young men passed him on the ladder of success. But then the twenty-eight-year-old Sterling, also tall, thin, and dreamy, had joined the section after unappreciated performances in other departments, and life in the section had become vibrant. Carmody and Sterling stimulated each other to new peaks in creativity\u2014and out of the incredibly fruitful union of their talents had come many things, the richest being the myth of Bomar Fessenden III.\nThere really was a Bomar Fessenden III, and he was a stockholder of the company, but neither Carmody nor Sterling knew anything about him save the number of shares he owned, one hundred, and his home address, 5889 Seaview Terrace, Great Neck, Long Island, New York. But Bomar\u2019s splendid name had caught Sterling\u2019s fancy. He started talking knowingly about the debauched life Fessenden led with the dividends the section mailed to him, claiming Fessenden as an old friend, a fraternity brother who wrote regularly from fleshpots around the world\u2014Acapulco, Palm Beach, Nice, Capri \u2026 Carmody had been charmed by the myth, and had contributed heavily to it.\n\u201cSome day!\u201d said Carmody, as they walked through the main gate. \u201cToo bad Bomar Fessenden III isn\u2019t here to see it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the many reasons I would never trade places with Bomar,\u201d said Sterling. \u201cNot for all his wealth and comfort and beautiful women. He never gets to see the seasons come and go.\u201d\n\u201cCut off from life, that\u2019s what Bomar is,\u201d said Carmody. \u201cHe might as well be dead. When winter comes, what does he do?\u201d\n\u201cBomar runs away from it,\u201d said Sterling. \u201cPathetic. He runs away from everything. I just got a card from him saying he\u2019s pulling out of Buenos Aires because of the dampness.\u201d", 0.1395339262187088], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}}
