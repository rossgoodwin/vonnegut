\u201cthis teaching job\u201d that he hopes \u201cwill fill me with a little more zowie\u201d was a school on Cape Cod for boys with behavior problems.\nGordon Forbes was considered one of the best \u201cdoubles\u201d tennis players in the world.\nBill Stern was a famous sportscaster of the thirties and forties. He had his own radio show that featured stories of famous athletes who overcame great odds.\nDear Knox:\nAugust would be fine. That\u2019s not a bad guess as to when the fish will be back in force. During June, even the village idiot was taking ten and twenty a day, dangling an unbaited bent pin in the cesspool of the county jail. Now even Brooks, with live sea worms, is getting skunked.\nAs I told you, I\u2019ve doubled the range of my boat by doubling the fuel supply, so maybe we can venture up the coast to Wellfleet, which has a reputation for bigger fish. Also\u2014if the money falls in on me between now and then (I will never let go of that dream), we can hire Charley Mayo in Provincetown, and no kidding catch a tuna.\nI am glad you find life stimulating. I do, too, kind of\u2014but not nearly enough. I am hoping that this teaching job will fill me with a little more zowie. What I\u2019d really like to do, I think, is make a movie. A commercial artist friend of mine up here nearly flipped his wig, and he did the very bright thing of going out to a working ranch in Colorado, ditching his twanging wife and kids, and riding and fishing and stepping in fresh bear dung and things like that. Did it for six weeks. What is called for is violent physical movement. The Brahmins up here have the violence thing beautifully worked out with tennis and sailing. I\u2019m not good enough at either one to frisk with them, which makes me sulky and sore-headed, and explains, I\u2019m sure, my yen for class warfare. I would be on the side of the volunteer firemen. I still can\u2019t believe Gordon Forbes learned to be a tennis champ in such a short time. Even Bill Stern would have some trouble swallowing that tale. Some body.\nI used to ride a horse pretty good, and I used to swim better than good.

Free will! Fire! Fire!\u201d he shouted at Prince.\nPrince did not move a muscle. He batted his eyes, but those were reflexes, and not free will, like me and the chicken noodle soup. One thing Prince was thinking, by his own account, was that if he moved a muscle, he might find himself in the New York State Maximum Security Adult Correctional Facility at Athena back in 1991 again.\nUnderstandable!\nSo Trout bypassed Prince for the moment, confessedly still looking out for numero uno. A smoke alarm was raising hell. if the building was really on fire, and the fire could not be brought under control, then Trout was going to have to find someplace else where a senior citizen could hunker down until whatever was going on outside died down some.\nHe found a lit cigar resting on a saucer in the picture gallery. The cigar, although illegal everywhere in New York County, was not yet, and probably never would be, a danger to anyone but itself. Its midpoint was centered in the saucer, so it wasn\u2019t going anywhere else as it oxidized. But the smoke alarm was yelling about the end of civilization as we had known it.\nTrout, in My Ten Years on Automatic Pilot, would synthesize what he should have said to the smoke alarm that afternoon: \u201cNonsense!

Jeff says he enjoyed his physics course in high school, and got top grades, but \u201cever since I have had physics at the university I have had much trouble with it. This was a huge blow to me because I was used to doing well in school.

His antique business consisted of trying to sell off what little was left of all the loot he had brought back from Europe in his glory days.\nThat was one way we went on eating\u2014and heating. Another source of cash was a small legacy Mother received from a relative in Germany. She inherited it after the lawsuit was settled. Otherwise, the Metzgers would have got that, too. But most of our money came from Felix, who was extraordinarily generous without our ever asking him for anything.\nAnd I told Miss Shoup that Mother gardened and helped me a lot with the housework, and helped Father with his antique business, and wrote letters to friends, and read a lot, and so on.\nWhat Miss Shoup wanted to see me about, though, was an essay on this assigned subject: \u201cThe Midland City Person I Most Admire.\u201d My hero was John Fortune, who died in Katmandu when I was only six years old.

time to call a forklift.\u201d The instant that slipped out he could have killed himself. Of all the heartless things to say! Who the hell did he think he was: Count Dracula?\nSheldon Hayes hissed at Berman with undiluted hatred. \u201cJesus Christ, man.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a cue. It was an expletive.\nThe two cops were now leaning backward, their arms dangling helplessly behind them, their faces aghast. How could they play this serious game with such a smart-ass making wisecracks? Lily Matthews had bared her clenched teeth and was sucking in air through the cracks in between them.\nGil Berman made a gesture that may have been instinctive for all comedians throughout history, comedians who have really stunk up a joint with abysmal tastelessness. He held up his hands palms outward, petting the hostile air as though it were an enormous sheepdog, meaning: \u201cHey, gimme a break. Gimme a chance, you guys. You guys know me,\u201d and so on.\nAnd then he said directly to Martha Jones, squatting so his eyes were almost level with hers: \u201cI admit it, Aunt Martha: I am Jesus Christ, I am Jesus Christ.\u201d\nFrom Martha Jones\u2019s lips and tongue, still Minnie Mouse, came these six words: \u201cYou bet your ass you are.\u201d But she was still a corpse, not about to leave there. And the iguana said to Lily, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d\nBefore answering she sent darts of contempt from her eyes into those of the great comedian. Then she said, \u201cFirst I have to sing to her. And then we all have to sing so we can march her out of here.\u201d Can you beat it? Martha Jones had made it all the way from Ithaca to Syracuse to Springfield to Northampton, and to the public library and then the Calvin Theater, in a town strange to her, without any songs or marching. Lily felt the need to explain: \u201cAfter she completes a mission, she tries to die, hopes to die.\u201d Sheldon Hayes and the two cops nodded in perfect understanding.\nGilbert Lanz Berman didn\u2019t nod. He was too upset about the bad impression he had made on this perfect micro-woman. He had fallen in love with her. Without Desamol to protect him, he had fallen in love with Dr. Helen Newman Klein back at Caldwell as well. He had so far found love an easily manageable side effect of sobriety, just as he had managed the occasional dizziness caused by Desamol: no need for panic or drastic revisions of lifestyle. The feeling would pass. What eighteen years of daily doses of Phillips\u2019 Milk of Magnesia had done to his lifestyle was something else again. His large intestine had become slack and pouchy and demoralized, causing him to be a loner, if for no other reason than that at any moment he might become what he himself had called, in a high-society proctologist\u2019s office, \u201ca carpet-bombing fart machine.\u201d\nNow the perfect Lily knelt before her catatonic Aunt Martha and crooned to her, in perfect pitch, the song \u201cSomewhere\u201d by the late genius Leonard Bernstein, a chain-smoker of cigarettes like Gil Berman\u2019s mother, from the great musical comedy West Side Story. Yes, and having heard the song, Martha Jones was on her feet and simpering. Lazarus! But she did not appear to be ready to go anywhere. At any moment, she might just sit down again. Lily explained: \u201cShe feels safe in there. It\u2019s so cold and wet outside. But she loves parades. Is there some song we all know that we can sing while we march her out to the car?\u201d\nSheldon Hayes jumped down from the stage, so excited to be taking part in a miracle. He said: \u201cRow, Row, Row Your Boat!\u201d He was back in nursery school! Asserting leadership, he broke into song, clumping his feet in a march tempo. The two cops and Lily joined in, singing the endless song while marching in place. Soon Martha Jones was singing and making the floor boom with her heavy footfalls.

The song its engines sang was a very low organ note. All her lights were on.\nTwo beautiful people, a young man and a young woman in evening clothes, were at the rail in the stern, loving each other and their dreams and the lake. They were honeymooning, too. They were Lance Rumfoord, of Newport, Rhode Island, and his bride, the former Cynthia Landry, who had been a childhood sweetheart of John F. Kennedy in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.\nThere was a slight coincidence here. Billy Pilgrim would later share a hospital room with Rumfoord\u2019s uncle, Professor Bertram Copeland Rumfoord of Harvard, official Historian of the United States Air Force.\nWhen the beautiful people were past, Valencia questioned her funny-looking husband about war.

And the soldiers and the barricades would surely have stopped them from getting there, if Private Geraldo Delgado had not opened up that pathway through the store.\n28\nTHESE CHILDREN would become six Eves to Captain von Kleist\u2019s Adam on Santa Rosalia, and they wouldn\u2019t have been in Guayaquil if it weren\u2019t for a young Ecuadorian bush pilot named Eduardo Xim\u00e9nez. During the previous summer, on the day after Roy Hepburn was buried, in fact, Xim\u00e9nez was flying his own four-passenger amphibious plane over the rain forest, near the headwaters of the Tiputini River, which flowed to the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Ocean. He had just delivered a French anthropologist and his survival equipment to a point downstream, on the border of Peru, where the Frenchman planned to begin a search for the elusive Kanka-bonos.\nXim\u00e9nez was headed next for Guayaquil, five hundred kilometers away and across two high and rugged mountain barriers. In Guayaquil, he was to pick up two Argentinian millionaire sportsmen, and take them to the landing field on the Gal\u00e1pagos island of Baltra, where they had chartered a deep-sea fishing boat and crew. They would not be going after just any sort of fish, either. They hoped to hook great white sharks, the same creatures who, thirty-one years later, would swallow Mary Hepburn and Captain von Kleist and Mandarax.\nXim\u00e9nez saw from the air these letters trampled in the mud of the riverbank: SOS. He landed on the water and then made his plane waddle ashore like a duck.\nHe was greeted by an eighty-year-old Roman Catholic priest from Ireland named Father Bernard Fitzgerald, who had lived with the Kanka-bonos for half a century. With him were the six little girls, the last of the Kanka-bonos. He and they had trampled the letters in the river-bank.\nFather Fitzgerald, incidentally, had a great-grandfather in common with John F. Kennedy, the first husband of Mrs. Onassis and the thirty-fifth president of the United States. If he had mated with an Indian, which he never did, everybody now alive might claim to be an Irish blue blood\u2014not that anybody today claims to be much of anything.\nAfter only about nine months of life, people even forget who their mothers were.\nThe girls had been at choir practice with Father Fitzgerald when everybody else in the tribe got sprayed. Some of the victims were still dying, so the old priest was going to stay with them. He wanted Xim\u00e9nez, though, to take the girls someplace where somebody could look after them.\nSo in only five hours those girls were flown from the Stone Age to the Electronics Age, from the freshwater swamps of the jungle to the brackish marshes of Guayaquil. They spoke only Kanka-bono, which only a few dying relatives in the jungle and, as things would turn out, one dirty old white man in Guayaquil could understand.", 0.04967171717171717], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["celeste", 0.1913772634900039], ["blurted", 0.16009708268902995], ["revised", 0.16009708268902995], ["threatening", 0.16009708268902995], ["instantly", 0.16009708268902995], ["dorothy", 0.15606991076580476], ["dismayingly", 0.1390926226720619], ["close", 0.13567765400088275], ["roof", 0.12680580121423873], ["stupid", 0.12680580121423873], ["treated", 0.11132623685769358], ["scared", 0.10580134119727072], ["marry", 0.10580134119727072], ["live", 0.0823713445841349], ["weren", 0.0760792426211578], ["care", 0.07251005972247952], ["human", 0.07087165907792571], ["women", 0.06642912955695979], ["man", 0.0653643096573953], ["death", 0.06508210644875269], ["mother", 0.06255539102635721], ["young", 0.06136688456716686], ["person", 0.0591211884412965], ["cook", 0.05703049536593434], ["god", 0.05507478260418976], ["wife", 0.05323767285217658], ["heard", 0.052359262643896204], ["thing", 0.046121321607406854]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI can\u2019t tell if it is or not,\u201d I said.\nAnd then she blurted: \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry you!\nMy God! \u201cWho would?\u201d I said.\n\u201cI just want to be a human being and not a nobody and a nothing, if I have to live under the same roof with a man\u2014any man,\u201d she said.

It took place at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where I taught in the famed Writers\u2019 Workshop in 1965 and 1966. My most famous colleagues were the novelists Vance Bourjaily, Nelson Algren, and Richard Yates, and the Chilean Jos\u00e9 Donoso, and the poets George Starbuck, James Tate, Marvin Bell, Donald Justice\u2014and the poet-founder of the Workshop, of course, who is Paul Engle.\nAmong those students of ours who would really amount to something as writers by and by, incidentally, were Jane Barnes and John Casey and Bruce Dobler and Andre Dubus and Gail Godwin and John Irving and Jonathan Penner.\nSo Algren and Donoso and I were new arrivals, and we went together to the first autumn meeting of the English department, against whose treasury our paychecks were drawn. We thought we should be there. Nobody had told us that lecturers in the Writers\u2019 Workshop traditionally ignored all such bureaucratic, sesquipedalian sniveling and obfuscation.\nSo Algren and Donoso and I were going down a staircase afterward. Algren had come late, and so had sat separate from Donoso and me. He and Donoso had never met before, so I introduced them on the staircase, explaining to Algren that Donoso was from Chile, but a graduate of Princeton University.\nAlgren shook Donoso\u2019s hand, but said nothing to him until we reached the bottom. He at last thought of something to say to a Chilean novelist: \u201cIt must be nice,\u201d he said, \u201cto come from a country that long and narrow.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAre many novelists schizophrenic\u2014at least marginally so? Do they hallucinate, seeing and hearing things that healthy people cannot sense? Do they turn disordered perceptions into gold in the literary marketplace? If writers are usefully crazy, what is the medical name for their disease? Or, if writers themselves aren\u2019t lunatics, perhaps a lot of their ancestors were.\nThe psychiatric department of the University of Iowa\u2019s hospital, it turns out, has wondered some about these questions, which have their roots in folklore. It has taken advantage of the large numbers of reputable writers who come to Iowa City, usually down on their luck, to teach at the Writers\u2019 Workshop. So they have questioned us about our mental health and about that of our ancestors and siblings, too.\nIt is apparent to them, I am told, that we are not hallucinators, nor are many of us descended from those who saw or heard things which weren\u2019t really there. Overwhelmingly, we are depressed, and are descended from those who, psychologically speaking, spent more time than anyone in his or her right mind would want to spend in gloom.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.10516638243910968], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["dogs", 0.14920073876808157], ["amy", 0.1363422314098649], ["depression", 0.09306444146249641], ["concessionaire", 0.08141490901611077], ["tough", 0.07460036938404078], ["bar", 0.07460036938404078], ["kind", 0.07070074159776102], ["bus", 0.056136297305585156], ["hostetter", 0.0487105367630803], ["gentlest", 0.04653222073124821], ["bloodhounds", 0.04653222073124821], ["butterfinger", 0.04653222073124821], ["mounds", 0.04653222073124821], ["banquet", 0.04653222073124821], ["corners", 0.04653222073124821], ["caramel", 0.04653222073124821], ["helplessness", 0.04653222073124821], ["bayed", 0.04653222073124821], ["involuntarily", 0.04653222073124821], ["teach", 0.04653222073124821], ["shift", 0.04653222073124821], ["attentive", 0.04653222073124821], ["coconut", 0.04653222073124821], ["weakened", 0.04653222073124821], ["coonhound", 0.04653222073124821], ["theater", 0.04653222073124821], ["spectator", 0.04653222073124821], ["works", 0.04448676485919953], ["heavily", 0.040707454508055387], ["jig", 0.040707454508055387], ["silicones", 0.040707454508055387], ["sweets", 0.040707454508055387], ["complexion", 0.040707454508055387], ["cent", 0.040707454508055387], ["chocolate", 0.040707454508055387], ["hurried", 0.040707454508055387], ["crowded", 0.040707454508055387], ["elation", 0.040707454508055387], ["problems", 0.040707454508055387], ["solve", 0.040707454508055387], ["hear", 0.03830651645373201], ["peanuts", 0.03730018469202039], ["customers", 0.03730018469202039], ["candy", 0.03730018469202039], ["settled", 0.03730018469202039], ["satisfaction", 0.03730018469202039], ["claim", 0.03730018469202039], ["ended", 0.034882688284862566], ["recognized", 0.034882688284862566], ["customer", 0.034882688284862566], ["squeezed", 0.034882688284862566], ["counter", 0.034882688284862566], ["barrow", 0.033007532391465845], ["movie", 0.033007532391465845], ["purse", 0.033007532391465845], ["bench", 0.03147541846882757], ["policeman", 0.03147541846882757], ["ma", 0.03147541846882757], ["display", 0.03147541846882757], ["watch", 0.030180034604732967], ["entitled", 0.030180034604732967], ["mouth", 0.030180034604732967], ["rest", 0.029057922061669753], ["grew", 0.029057922061669753], ["special", 0.029057922061669753], ["polite", 0.029057922061669753], ["wife", 0.028356078408545846], ["lights", 0.028068148652792578], ["evening", 0.028068148652792578], ["alive", 0.02718276616827303], ["pulled", 0.02718276616827303], ["hurt", 0.026381840287564417], ["half", 0.023233155838476936], ["red", 0.023233155838476936], ["suddenly", 0.023233155838476936], ["big", 0.022906672220552933], ["lady", 0.022723705234977482], ["care", 0.022243382429599765], ["sweet", 0.021789036032370552], ["felt", 0.021357999945080215], ["hard", 0.019825886022441938], ["sat", 0.019825886022441938], ["coming", 0.019825886022441938], ["stood", 0.019153258226866005], ["heard", 0.018836112613564767], ["company", 0.01823561711791649], ["men", 0.01795073012904522], ["real", 0.016898939011784662], ["things", 0.01665534626495061], ["girl", 0.016418616206406944], ["love", 0.015964269809177735], ["twenty", 0.015745988410831007], ["room", 0.015533233721887396], ["wasn", 0.01382784847821773], ["looked", 0.0115836233920913], ["good", 0.010250808012455682], ["going", 0.008907541617985968], ["time", 0.008812587372154596]], "sentiment": ["The corners of my wife-to-be\u2019s sweet red mouth pulled down involuntarily.\nSomewhere out in the works, dogs bayed.\n\u201cHear that?\u201d said the policeman with satisfaction. \u201cThey got dogs looking for him now.

obvious, if somebody had not started to do something about it and then stopped. There was a tall stepladder set against one wall. There was a bucket at the base of it, filled with dirty water and with a brush floating on top. Someone had clearly scaled the ladder with the bucket. He had scrubbed as much of the wall as he could reach from the top. He had created a circle of cleanliness, dribbling filth at its bottom, to be sure, but as bright as a harvest moon.\nI do not know who made the harvest moon. There was no one to ask. There had been no doorman to invite us in. There were no bellboys and no guests inside. There wasn\u2019t a soul behind the reception desk in the distance. The newsstand and the theater-ticket kiosk were shuttered. The doors of the unmanned elevators were propped open by chairs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re in business anymore,\u201d said Sarah.\n\u201cSomebody accepted my reservation on the telephone,\u201d I said. \u201cHe called me \u2018monsieur.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAnybody can call anybody \u2018monsieur\u2019 on the telephone,\u201d said Sarah.\nBut then we heard a Gypsy violin crying somewhere\u2014sobbing as though its heart would break. And when I hear that violin\u2019s lamenting in my memory now, I am able to add this information: Hitler, not yet in power, would soon cause to be killed every Gypsy his soldiers and policemen could catch.\nThe music was coming from behind a folding screen in the lobby. Sarah and I dared to move the screen from the wall. We were confronted by a pair of French doors, which were held shut with a padlock and hasp. The panes in the doors were mirrors, showing us yet again how childish and rich we were. But Sarah discovered one pane that had a flaw in its silvering. She peeped through the flaw, then invited me to take a turn. I was flabbergasted. I might have been peering into the twinkling prisms of a time machine. On the other side of the French doors was the famous dining room of the Hotel Arapahoe in pristine condition, complete with a Gypsy fiddler\u2014almost atom for atom as it must have been in the time of Diamond Jim Brady. A thousand candles in the chandeliers and on the tables became billions of tiny stars because of all the silver and crystal and china and mirrors in there.\nThe story was this: The hotel and the restaurant, while sharing the same building, one minute from Times Square, were under separate ownerships. The hotel had given up\u2014was no longer taking guests. The restaurant, on the other hand, had just been completely refurbished, its owner believing that the collapse of the economy would be brief, and was caused by nothing more substantial than a temporary loss of nerve by businessmen.", 0.08833333333333335], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["craft", 0.15174291878197493], ["essay", 0.13325899396704308], ["morgana", 0.10882457445039893], ["fata", 0.10882457445039893], ["pleasure", 0.0999442454752823], ["seas", 0.06662949698352154], ["mirage", 0.06122329554207935], ["peak", 0.0573875345760556], ["frank", 0.054533307606167605], ["cruel", 0.04992599073691663], ["swamped", 0.03793572969549373], ["fins", 0.03793572969549373], ["shod", 0.03793572969549373], ["le", 0.03793572969549373], ["gull", 0.03793572969549373], ["fay", 0.03793572969549373], ["appearing", 0.03793572969549373], ["clouds", 0.03793572969549373], ["rocky", 0.03793572969549373], ["cleaving", 0.03793572969549373], ["fairy", 0.03793572969549373], ["biscuits", 0.03793572969549373], ["decision", 0.03793572969549373], ["nuzzled", 0.03793572969549373], ["visited", 0.03793572969549373], ["glorious", 0.03793572969549373], ["deception", 0.03793572969549373], ["opportunity", 0.03793572969549373], ["indicate", 0.03793572969549373], ["teethed", 0.03793572969549373], ["dorsal", 0.03793572969549373], ["messina", 0.03793572969549373], ["boil", 0.03793572969549373], ["jug", 0.03793572969549373], ["alit", 0.03793572969549373], ["strait", 0.03793572969549373], ["calabria", 0.03793572969549373], ["poetic", 0.03793572969549373], ["waters", 0.03793572969549373], ["luxurious", 0.03793572969549373], ["shores", 0.03793572969549373], ["eaten", 0.03793572969549373], ["chris", 0.03793572969549373], ["departure", 0.03793572969549373], ["point", 0.03733316928570528], ["sharks", 0.03331474849176077], ["lake", 0.03331474849176077], ["sinking", 0.03331474849176077], ["immortal", 0.03331474849176077], ["relative", 0.03331474849176077], ["eating", 0.03331474849176077], ["crap", 0.03331474849176077], ["sicily", 0.03331474849176077], ["needle", 0.03331474849176077], ["morgan", 0.03331474849176077], ["40", 0.03331474849176077], ["wanted", 0.030974181657834488], ["cuba", 0.030611647771039675], ["admitted", 0.030611647771039675], ["maker", 0.030611647771039675], ["passport", 0.030611647771039675], ["stepped", 0.030611647771039675], ["eyes", 0.028853319062771988], ["caribbean", 0.0286937672880278], ["bottom", 0.0286937672880278], ["sixty", 0.0286937672880278], ["dry", 0.0286937672880278], ["thermos", 0.0286937672880278], ["accept", 0.0286937672880278], ["warm", 0.0286937672880278], ["jail", 0.0286937672880278], ["explain", 0.027206143612599733], ["gentle", 0.027206143612599733], ["mountain", 0.027206143612599733], ["barracuda", 0.027206143612599733], ["capital", 0.025990666567306704], ["blood", 0.025990666567306704], ["lived", 0.025990666567306704], ["ashore", 0.025990666567306704], ["bitch", 0.024962995368458314], ["wide", 0.024962995368458314], ["famous", 0.02407278608429483], ["meaningless", 0.02407278608429483], ["opened", 0.023287565846585607], ["fact", 0.023287565846585607], ["raised", 0.022585162408866766], ["mount", 0.022585162408866766], ["piece", 0.022585162408866766], ["short", 0.022585162408866766], ["reading", 0.021949761210171267], ["city", 0.021949761210171267], ["foot", 0.021369685363573736], ["mercy", 0.021369685363573736], ["learned", 0.021369685363573736], ["moment", 0.021369685363573736], ["lorenzo", 0.020843000923719587], ["named", 0.020342014164725346], ["bolivar", 0.020342014164725346], ["san", 0.019416705996357347], ["door", 0.019047640735118963], ["happened", 0.01866658464285264], ["days", 0.01866658464285264], ["hope", 0.0183061365010508], ["felix", 0.01703243492263274], ["mccabe", 0.01647655752970573], ["son", 0.016215086108683857], ["making", 0.015487090828917244], ["house", 0.0152610804844127], ["sea", 0.015042481665592763], ["monzano", 0.014830823676828895], ["ice", 0.014625679285717202], ["life", 0.01226807901742668], ["looked", 0.011990261041422891], ["going", 0.011855576325972762], ["dr", 0.011594104904950888], ["god", 0.011100051757259408], ["papa", 0.010866109625184275], ["hoenikker", 0.010314831519550186], ["told", 0.009241962407465937], ["asked", 0.007863332985381402], ["man", 0.007301597361263136]], "sentiment": ["In the essay, Frank told of being all alone on a nearly swamped sixty-eight-foot Chris-Craft in the Caribbean. He didn\u2019t explain what he was doing on it or how he happened to be alone. He did indicate, though, that his point of departure had been Cuba.\n\u201cThe luxurious pleasure craft was going down, and my meaningless life with it,\u201d said the essay. \u201cAll I\u2019d eaten for four days was two biscuits and a sea gull. The dorsal fins of man-eating sharks were cleaving the warm seas around me, and needle-teethed barracuda were making those waters boil.\n\u201cI raised my eyes to my Maker, willing to accept whatever His decision might be. And my eyes alit on a glorious mountain peak above the clouds. Was this Fata Morgana\u2014the cruel deception of a mirage?\u201d\nI looked up Fata Morgana at this point in my reading; learned that it was, in fact, a mirage named after Morgan le Fay, a fairy who lived at the bottom of a lake. It was famous for appearing in the Strait of Messina, between Calabria and Sicily. Fata Morgana was poetic crap, in short.\nWhat Frank saw from his sinking pleasure craft was not cruel Fata Morgana, but the peak of Mount McCabe. Gentle seas then nuzzled Frank\u2019s pleasure craft to the rocky shores of San Lorenzo, as though God wanted him to go there.\nFrank stepped ashore, dry shod, and asked where he was. The essay didn\u2019t say so, but the son of a bitch had a piece of ice-nine with him\u2014in a thermos jug.\nFrank, having no passport, was put in jail in the capital city of Bolivar. He was visited there by \u201cPapa\u201d Monzano, who wanted to know if it were possible that Frank was a blood relative of the immortal Dr. Felix Hoenikker.\n\u201cI admitted I was,\u201d said Frank in the essay. \u201cSince that moment, every door to opportunity in San Lorenzo has been opened wide to me.\u201d\n40\nHOUSE OF HOPE AND MERCY", -0.005718954248366017], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["illusion", 0.15298883070233385], ["unexplained", 0.08654002666362991], ["absences", 0.08654002666362991], ["mysteries", 0.08654002666362991], ["mysteriousness", 0.08654002666362991], ["secretiveness", 0.08654002666362991], ["shadowy", 0.08654002666362991], ["unsuspected", 0.08654002666362991], ["implication", 0.08654002666362991], ["anita", 0.0803648904997038], ["indulged", 0.07649441535116693], ["conspiratorial", 0.07649441535116693], ["impulse", 0.07649441535116693], ["gladly", 0.07649441535116693], ["worlds", 0.07649441535116693], ["appetite", 0.07061810943655585], ["lift", 0.07061810943655585], ["love", 0.07002648632756663], ["sharing", 0.06644880403870394], ["reach", 0.06644880403870394], ["surprising", 0.06644880403870394], ["finnerty", 0.0657959381355933], ["katharine", 0.06405976011875074], ["told", 0.063393397271658], ["odd", 0.0632148395269038], ["supper", 0.0632148395269038], ["planned", 0.0632148395269038], ["easily", 0.06057249812409286], ["reached", 0.05178792126075496], ["afraid", 0.05178792126075496], ["friends", 0.05052688681162989], ["goodbye", 0.04936684756998443], ["late", 0.04829281898804643], ["feeling", 0.04635758141377799], ["filled", 0.04386699798005829], ["drink", 0.04241651307343536], ["thinking", 0.04241651307343536], ["club", 0.04241651307343536], ["wife", 0.04048127549916691], ["pittsburgh", 0.038247207675583456], ["air", 0.038247207675583456], ["small", 0.035866004033680905], ["felt", 0.03543335239383045], ["country", 0.03543335239383045], ["call", 0.034604969584555834], ["knew", 0.034604969584555834], ["open", 0.03202988005937537], ["day", 0.02984404107771473], ["hell", 0.02744528109977889], ["life", 0.026041660433258344], ["thought", 0.025387741081367477], ["man", 0.024732406590542242], ["kroner", 0.02009122262492595], ["looked", 0.01841712281156589], ["paul", 0.017271801311244644]], "sentiment": ["\u201cAll right.
