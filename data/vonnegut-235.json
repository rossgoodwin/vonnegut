Knopf, who moved to a house across the street\u2014and Jill Krementz, who is now my wife, and I moved in.\nJill runs her photographic business out of the bottom floor. I run my writing business out of the top floor. We share the two floors in between.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe people in this city have been very friendly to me, although I was born far away. They have uses for strangers who do good work in the arts here, and I have done reasonably good work as a novelist from time to time.\nThe most satisfying kindness which has been done me here was an invitation from St. Clement\u2019s Episcopal Church, whose congregation includes many actors, to preach on Palm Sunday in 1980. It is the custom of that church, which is also a theater, to have a stranger preach just once a year.\nThe altar there is portable, since the front of the church is also a stage. Very few plays would work well with an altar as a fixed centerpiece. So, on the morning I preached, the altar had been trundled temporarily onto a set which was the kitchen of a Manhattan tenement of perhaps sixty years ago or more\u2014before I was born.\nI do not know what play the set was for. I have not asked. I want to imagine that it was for a play about European immigrants to New York City and their children. I was happy to speak from that set as a descendent of immigrants who settled much farther inland, immigrants about whom native New Yorkers often know nothing and imagine the worst.\nI had this to say:\n\u201cI am enchanted by the Sermon on the Mount. Being merciful, it seems to me, is the only good idea we have received so far. Perhaps we will get another idea that good by and by\u2014and then we will have two good ideas. What might that second good idea be? I don\u2019t know. How could I know? I will make a wild guess that it will come from music somehow. I have often wondered what music is and why we love it so. It may be that music is that second good idea\u2019s being born.\n\u201cI choose as my text the first eight verses of John twelve, which deal not with Palm Sunday but with the night before\u2014with Palm Sunday Eve, with what we might call \u2019Spikenard Saturday.\u2019 I hope that will be close enough to Palm Sunday to leave you more or less satisfied. I asked an Episcopalian priest the other day what I should say to you about Palm Sunday itself. She told me to say that it was a brilliant satire on pomp and circumstance and high honors in this world.

He drove a new Cadillac the color of lobster bisque. And on the back bumper of the Cadillac was a big trailer-hitch that hauled Stedman\u2019s silver home on wheels to Cape Cod in the springtime and to Florida in the fall. Stedman was an artist\u2014a picture painter. But he didn\u2019t look like one. Part of his stock-in-trade was looking like a four-square businessman, like a no-nonsense free-enterpriser who knew what it was to meet a payroll, like a man\u2019s man who thought most artists were dreamers, who thought most art was bunk. He was sixty years old, and he looked a good deal like George Washington.\nThe sign over his studio in the art colony of Seminole Highlands, Florida, said it all: \u201cDurling Stedman\u2014Art Without Bunk.\u201d He set up shop right in the middle of struggling abstract painters. That was slick of him, because a majority of the tourists were confused and angered by the abstractionists. And then, in the middle of all the gibberish, the disgruntled tourists came upon Stedman and his work. Stedman\u2019s paintings were as pretty as postcards. And Stedman himself looked like a friend from home.\n\u201cI am an oasis,\u201d he liked to say.\nEvery night he did a demonstration painting on an easel in front of his studio. He did a painting in an hour flat with a crowd watching. He signified that he was done by putting a golden frame around the painting. The crowd knew then that it was all right to talk and applaud. A sudden noise couldn\u2019t spoil the masterpiece now, because the masterpiece was done.\nThe price of the masterpiece was on a card tacked to the frame: \u201c65.00, frame included. Ask about our lay-away plan.\u201d The \u201cour\u201d on the card referred to Stedman and his wife Cornelia. Cornelia didn\u2019t know much about art, but she thought her husband was another Leonardo da Vinci.\nAnd Cornelia wasn\u2019t the only one who thought so.\n\u201cI swear,\u201d said a thunderstruck woman in the demonstration crowd one night, \u201cwhen you was doing them birch trees, it looked like you was using some kind of birch-bark paint\u2014like all a body had to do was gob it on and it\u2019d come out birch bark. And the same with them clouds\u2014like you was using cloud paint, and all a body had to do was scrootch it on up top without hardly thinking.\u201d\nStedman offered her his palette and brush playfully. \u201cHelp yourself, Madam,\u201d he said. He smiled serenely, but it was an empty smile\u2014a case of the show\u2019s going on. All was not well.

It assumes that I am a teacher. I explained in an earlier chapter, I believe, how my name happened to find its way onto a list of supposed educators, how I became recipient of mail promoting materials useful to those in charge of training the young.\nThe letter at hand is from \u201cCreative Playthings, Inc.\u201d\nDear Friend: [Creative Playthings says to me, here in a Jerusalem jail] Would you like to foster a creative environment for your students in their own homes? What happens to them after they leave school certainly is important. You may have a child under your direction an average of 25 waking hours per week, but the parents guide him for 45 hours. What a parent does with these hours can complicate or facilitate your program.\nWe believe the kind of toys Creative Playthings sponsors will genuinely stimulate\u2014in the home\u2014the creative environment you, as an early childhood leader, are trying to foster.\nHow can Creative Playthings\u2019 toys in the home do this?\nSuch toys can provide for the physical needs of growing children. Such toys help a child discover and experiment with life in the home and community. Such toys promote opportunities for individual expression which may be lacking in the group life of the school.\nSuch toys help the child work off aggressions. \u2026\nTo which I reply:\nDear Friends: As one who has experienced extensively with life in the home and community, using real people in true-to-life situations, I doubt that any playthings could prepare a child for one millionth of what is going to hit him in the teeth, ready or not.\nMy own feeling is that a child should start experimenting with real people and real communities from the moment of birth, if possible.
