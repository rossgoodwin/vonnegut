I could not really argue with her, since she, clearly, was going to be the one who had to raise it. But she had a miscarriage a week ago, having carried the child for three months. We will start again. \u201cDa capo,\u201d as you said to me one time, after we had had some falling out, and had to start the friendship over again.\nJane, who has so long sought to renew and reinvigorate herself through magic, through credulousness in the presence of religious quacks, has at last had startling success, I am told, with ordinary therapy. She has always been a wonderful writer, you know, who could write only with painful clumsiness. Now, Edith told me yesterday at lunch, she writes like the wind every day. Her subject: What it was like to already have three kids, and then to adopt three more. Why not? The book could easily be delightful and wise. I wish her nothing but success and happiness.\nAs for Edith: She has a decent studio at last, in what used to be manufacturing space on Twelfth Street, right off Fifth Avenue. She is painting enormous, surrealistic allegories. Yes\u2014she has heard of Goya, and some others, too. There are women carrying men. The men are content to be carried everywhere.\nWhen can we see another book?\nCheers\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut\nP.S. I had dinner with Nelson Algren in Sag Harbor (Long Island) last summer, and brought John Irving and his wife along. Nelson\u2019s jokes were more obscure than usual.

Every so often, I catch myself getting gloomy over what happened to the pay-toilet business it took me thirty years to build.\nBut the youngsters don\u2019t have any hangovers like that from the past. They don\u2019t even worry much about something happening to the storage centers, the way us oldsters do.\nSo I guess maybe that\u2019ll be the next step in evolution\u2014to break clean like those first amphibians who crawled out of the mud into the sunshine, and who never did go back to the sea.\n(1953)\nTHE KID NOBODY COULD HANDLE\nIT WAS SEVEN-THIRTY in the morning. Waddling, clanking, muddy machines were tearing a hill to pieces behind a restaurant, and trucks were hauling the pieces away. Inside the restaurant, dishes rattled on their shelves. Tables quaked, and a very kind fat man with a headful of music looked down at the jiggling yolks of his breakfast eggs. His wife was visiting relatives out of town. He was on his own.\nThe kind fat man was George M. Helmholtz, a man of forty, head of the music department of Lincoln High School, and director of the band. Life had treated him well. Each year he dreamed the same big dream. He dreamed of leading as fine a band as there was on the face of the earth. And each year the dream came true.\nIt came true because Helmholtz was sure that a man couldn\u2019t have a better dream than his. Faced by this unnerving sureness, Kiwanians, Rotarians, and Lions paid for band uniforms that cost twice as much as their best suits, school administrators let Helmholtz raid the budget for expensive props, and youngsters played their hearts out for him. When youngsters had no talent, Helmholtz made them play on guts alone.\nEverything was good about Helmholtz\u2019s life save his finances. He was so dazzled by his big dream that he was a child in the marketplace. Ten years before, he had sold the hill behind the restaurant to Bert Quinn, the restaurant owner, for one thousand dollars. It was now apparent, even to Helmholtz, that Helmholtz had been had.\nQuinn sat down in the booth with the bandmaster. He was a bachelor, a small, dark, humorless man. He wasn\u2019t a well man. He couldn\u2019t sleep, he couldn\u2019t stop working, he couldn\u2019t smile warmly. He had only two moods: one suspicious and self-pitying, the other arrogant and boastful. The first mood applied when he was losing money. The second mood applied when he was making it.", 0.16181681681681678], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["lowers", 0.43823796050041575], ["trigger", 0.43823796050041575], ["falters", 0.43823796050041575], ["squeeze", 0.43823796050041575], ["knees", 0.3144350441593311], ["rifle", 0.26111603027010455], ["better", 0.24709129513210804], ["dead", 0.22992640656947652], ["woodly", 0.08172034602121299], ["harold", 0.07177282507070595]], "sentiment": ["No.\n(goes down on his knees) No.\nHAROLD\nGet up.\nWOODLY\nNo.\nHAROLD\nHave it your way.
