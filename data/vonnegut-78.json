About three of \u2019em, now mine, all mine. She stopped when there was nothing more about her in the morning paper.

There was wall-to-wall carpeting in federal gold, except in the kitchen and bathroom areas and over the iron manhole cover in the center of the floor. There were magazines arranged in a fan on the coffee table in front of the couch.\nThere was a stereophonic phonograph. The phonograph worked. The television didn\u2019t.

He had a great head of curly hair which had once been golden, which now was white. He had been put in command of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, with the understanding that his first mate would do all the serious thinking, for the same reason *Siegfried had been put in charge of the hotel: His uncles in Quito had wanted a close relative to watch over their famous guests and valuable property.\nThe Captain and his brother had beautiful homes in the chilly mists above Quito, which they would never see again. They had also inherited considerable wealth from their murdered mother and both sets of grandparents. Almost none of it was in worthless sucres. Almost all of it was managed by the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City, which had caused it to be represented by U.S. dollars and Japanese yen.\nDancing there in the shower stall, the Captain did not think he had much to worry about, as troubled as things seemed to be in Guayaquil. No matter what happened, Hernando Cruz would know what to do.\nHis big brain came up with what he thought might be a good idea to pass on to Cruz after he had dried himself off. If it looked like crewmen were about to desert, he thought, Cruz could remind them that the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was technically a ship of war, which meant that deserters would be subject to strict punishment under regulations of the Navy.\nThis was bad law, but he was right that the ship on paper was a part of the Ecuadorian Navy. The Captain himself, in his role as admiral, had welcomed her to that fighting force when she arrived from Malm\u00f6 during the summer. Her decks had yet to be carpeted, and the bare steel was dotted here and there with plugged holes which could accept the mounts for machine guns and rocket launchers and racks of depth charges and so on, should war ever come.\nShe would then become an armored troop carrier, with, as the Captain had said on The Tonight Show, \u201c\u2026 ten bottles of Dom P\u00e9rignon and one bidet for every hundred enlisted men.\u201d\nThe Captain had some other ideas in the shower, but they had all come from Hernando Cruz. For instance: If the cruise was canceled, which seemed almost a certainty, then Cruz and a few men would anchor the ship out on the marsh somewhere, away from looters. Cruz could think of no reason for the Captain to come along on a trip like that.\nIf all hell broke loose, and there seemed no safe place for the ship anywhere near the city, then Cruz planned to take her out to the naval base on the Gal\u00e1pagos Island of Baltra. Again, Cruz hadn\u2019t been able to think of a reason for the Captain to come along.\nOr, if the celebrities from New York City were still, incredibly, going to arrive the next morning, then it would be vital that the Captain be aboard to greet and reassure them. While waiting for them, Cruz would anchor the Bah\u00eda de Darwin offshore, like the Colombian freighter San Mateo. He would bring the ship back to the wharf only when the celebrities were right there, ready to board.

Nobody ever laughs. But one is an old \u2019Two Black Crows\u201d joke. The \u201cTwo Black Crows\u201d were white guys in blackface\u2014named Moran and Mack. They made phonograph records of their routines, two supposedly black guys talking lazily to each other. Anyway, one of them says, \u201cLast night I dreamed I was eating flannel cakes.\u201d The other one says, \u201cIs that so?\u201d And the first one says, \u201cAnd when I woke up, the blanket was gone.\u201d\nINTERVIEWER: Um.\nVONNEGUT: I told you you wouldn\u2019t laugh.\nINTERVIEWER: YOU seem to prefer Laurel and Hardy over Chaplin.

In his own way, he\u2019s as brilliant as Picasso, and this is intimidating to me.\nINTERVIEWER: Will you ever write another short story?\nVONNEGUT: Maybe. I wrote what I thought would be my last one about eight years ago. Har\u00edan Ellison asked me to contribute to a collection he was making. The story\u2019s called \u201cThe Big Space Fuck.\u201d I think I am the first writer to use \u201cFuck\u201d in a title. It was about firing a space ship with a warhead full of jizzum at Andromeda. Which reminds me of my good Indianapolis friend, about the only Indianapolis friend I\u2019ve got left\u2014William Failey.

When the Civil War came, George raised a company of Indiana riflemen, marched off with them to join the nearly legendary Black Hat Brigade. Under George's command was Noah's substitute, the Rosewater village idiot, Fletcher Moon. Moon was blown to hamburger by Stonewall Jackson's artillery at Second Bull Run.\nDuring the retreat through the mud toward Alexandria, Captain Rosewater took time out to write his brother Noah this note:\nFletcher Moon kept up his end of the deal to the utmost of his ability. If you are put out about your considerable investment in him being used up so quickly, I suggest you write General Pope for a partial refund. Wish you were here.\nGeorge\nTo which Noah replied:\nI am sorry about Fletcher Moon, but, as the Bible says, \"A deal is a deal.\" Enclosed find some routine legal papers for you to sign. They empower me to run your half of the farm and the saw factory until your return, etc., etc. We are undergoing great privations here at home. Everything is going to the troops. A word of appreciation from the troops would be much appreciated.\nNoah.\nBy the time of Antietam, George Rosewater had become a Lieutenant Colonel, and had, curiously, lost the little fingers from both hands. At Antietam, he had his horse shot out from under him, advanced on foot, grabbed the regimental colors from a dying boy, found himself holding only a shattered staff when Confederate cannister carried the colors away. He pressed on, killed a man with the staff. At the moment he was doing the killing, one of his own men fired off a musket that still had its ramrod jammed down the bore. The explosion blinded Colonel Rosewater for life.\nGeorge returned to Rosewater County a blind brevet brigadier. People found him remarkably cheerful. And his cheerfulness did not seem to fade one iota when it was explained to him by bankers and lawyers, who kindly offered to be his eyes, that he didn't own anything any more, that he had signed everything over to Noah. Noah, unfortunately, was not in town to explain things in person to George.

idealized Julius Caesar. Most of all, though, Cady had know-how, know-how of a priceless variety that caused large manufacturing concerns to bid for his services like dying sultans offering half their kingdoms for a cure.\nCady could stroll through a plant that had been losing money for a generation, glance at the books, yawn and tell the manager how he could save half a million a year in materials, reduce his staff by a third, triple his output, and sell the stuff he\u2019d been throwing out as waste for more than the cost of installing air-conditioning and continuous music throughout the plant. And the air-conditioning and music would increase individual productivity by as much as ten percent and cut union grievances by a fifth.\nThe latest firm to hire him was the Federal Apparatus Corporation, which had given him the rank of vice-president and sent him to Ilium, New York, where he was to see that the new company headquarters were built properly from the ground up. When the buildings were finished, hundreds of the company\u2019s top executives would move their offices from New York City to Ilium, a city that had virtually died when its textile mills moved south after the Second World War.\nThere was jubilation in Ilium when the deep, thick foundations for the new headquarters were poured, but the exultation was possibly highest in the village of Spruce Falls, nine miles from Ilium, for it was there that Newell Cady had rented, with an option to buy, one of the mansions that lined the shaded main street.\nSpruce Falls was a cluster of small businesses and a public school and a post office and a police station and a firehouse serving surrounding dairy farms. During the second decade of the century it experienced a real estate boom. Fifteen mansions were built back then, in the belief that the area, because of its warm mineral springs, was becoming a spa for rich invalids and hypochondriacs and horse people, as had Saratoga, not far away.\nIn 1922, though, it was determined that bathing in the waters of the spring, while fairly harmless, was nonetheless responsible for several cases of a rash that a Manhattan dermatologist, with no respect for upstate real estate values, named \u201cSpruce Falls disease.\u201d\nIn no time at all the mansions and their stables were as vacant as the abandoned palaces and temples of Angkor Thorn in Cambodia. Banks foreclosed on those mansions that were mortgaged. The rest became property of the town in lieu of unpaid taxes. Nobody arrived from out of town to bid for them at any price, as though Spruce Falls disease were leprosy or cholera or bubonic plague.\nNine mansions were eventually bought from the banks or the town by locals, who could not resist getting so much for so little. They set up housekeeping in maybe six rooms at most, while dry rot and termites and mice and rats and squirrels and kids wrought havoc with the rest of the property.\n\u201cIf we can make Newell Cady taste the joys of village life,\u201d said Fire Chief Stanley Atkins, speaking before an extraordinary meeting of the volunteer firemen on a Saturday afternoon, \u201che\u2019ll use that option to buy, and Spruce Falls will become the fashionable place for Federal Apparatus executives to live. Without further ado,\u201d said Chief Atkins expansively, \u201cI move that Mr. Newell Cady be elected to full membership in the fire department and be named head judge of the annual Hobby Show.\u201d\n\u201cAudaces fortune juvat!\u201d said Upton Beaton, who was a tall, fierce-seeming sixty-five. He was the last of what had been the first family of Spruce Falls. \u201cFortune,\u201d he translated after a pause, \u201cfavors the bold, that\u2019s true. But gentlemen\u2014\u201d and he paused again, portentously, while Chief Atkins looked worried and the other members of the fire department shifted about on their folding chairs. Like his forebears, Beaton had an ornamental education from Harvard, and like them, he lived in Spruce Falls because it took little effort for a Beaton to feel superior to his neighbors there. He survived on money his family had made during the short-lived boom.", 0.1600806768988587], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["lyle", 0.23796154270064424], ["1954", 0.10761223588905605], ["button", 0.08519157693664564], ["nose", 0.08519157693664564], ["kyle", 0.07932051423354808], ["broken", 0.06789978386751905], ["happened", 0.06062070337897348], ["overalls", 0.053806117944528026], ["phenomenon", 0.053806117944528026], ["crib", 0.053806117944528026], ["couples", 0.053806117944528026], ["enviable", 0.053806117944528026], ["triggered", 0.053806117944528026], ["halfway", 0.053806117944528026], ["suck", 0.053806117944528026], ["healthier", 0.053806117944528026], ["derby", 0.053806117944528026], ["adopting", 0.053806117944528026], ["thumbs", 0.053806117944528026], ["side", 0.04979155539811286], ["children", 0.04862505715648126], ["text", 0.04673318753065103], ["pork", 0.04673318753065103], ["cathedral", 0.04673318753065103], ["couch", 0.04673318753065103], ["hat", 0.04673318753065103], ["bubbles", 0.04673318753065103], ["moby", 0.04673318753065103], ["dick", 0.04259578846832282], ["frame", 0.04259578846832282], ["stepbrothers", 0.04259578846832282], ["chaos", 0.04259578846832282], ["adopted", 0.04259578846832282], ["twins", 0.04259578846832282], ["agreed", 0.04259578846832282], ["pie", 0.04259578846832282], ["roller", 0.04259578846832282], ["leather", 0.04259578846832282], ["glad", 0.03966025711677404], ["talking", 0.03738328210336374], ["alike", 0.03738328210336374], ["inner", 0.03738328210336374], ["familiar", 0.03738328210336374], ["apart", 0.035522858054445834], ["bodies", 0.035522858054445834], ["bosom", 0.032587326702897046], ["babies", 0.032587326702897046], ["wearing", 0.032587326702897046], ["programmed", 0.032587326702897046], ["shoes", 0.032587326702897046], ["office", 0.03138545899211762], ["fight", 0.03138545899211762], ["cave", 0.03138545899211762], ["closed", 0.03138545899211762], ["creature", 0.03031035168948674], ["wore", 0.03031035168948674], ["crazy", 0.02933779883434057], ["common", 0.02933779883434057], ["remembered", 0.02933779883434057], ["dwayne", 0.028213175705591592], ["picture", 0.025514396289020056], ["hadn", 0.02489577769905643], ["incidentally", 0.02431252857824063], ["coming", 0.02431252857824063], ["week", 0.023760822238748026], ["real", 0.02323742127560975], ["woman", 0.02323742127560975], ["mind", 0.022739562457554322], ["door", 0.022739562457554322], ["sat", 0.022264868420463577], ["francine", 0.01980403110600554], ["person", 0.019445956414053802], ["work", 0.019100022213281543], ["couldn", 0.018441465875143063], ["men", 0.016687891824871032], ["lot", 0.014518897518915184], ["black", 0.012914962993176283], ["looked", 0.010025919565462811], ["hoover", 0.008593701629800337], ["people", 0.0076654181787214936]], "sentiment": ["There was a picture of a crazy person to go with the text.
