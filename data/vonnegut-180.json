The message was from Arpad Leen. It was a holograph, like Mary Kathleen\u2019s will, which I had in the inner pocket of my suitcase\u2014along with my Doctor of Mixology degree. The pockets of my raincoat were stuffed with other materials from Mary Kathleen\u2019s shoes. They bulged like saddlebags.\nLeen wrote that the letter was for my eyes only. He said that in the midst of the confusion at his penthouse he had never gotten around to offering a specific job to me. He suggested that I would be happy in his old division, which was Down Home Records. It now included The New York Times and Universal Pictures and Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey and Dell Publishing, among other things. There was also a catfood company, he said, which I needn\u2019t worry about. It was about to be transferred to the General Foods Division. It had belonged to the Times.\n\u201cIf this is not your cup of tea,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe\u2019ll find something that is. I am absolutely thrilled to know that we will have an observer for Mrs. Graham among us. Please give her my warmest regards.\u201d\nThere was a postscript. He said that he had taken the liberty of making an appointment for me at eleven the next morning with someone named Morty Sills. There was an address. I assumed that Sills was a RAMJAC personnel director or something. It turned out that he was a tailor.\nOnce again a multimillionaire was sending Walter F. Starbuck to his own tailor, to be made into a convincing counterfeit of a perfect gentleman.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOn the following morning I was still numbed by my dread of the avalanche. I was four thousand dollars richer and technically a thief. Mary Kathleen had had four one-thousand-dollar bills as insoles for her basketball shoes.\nThere was nothing in the papers about the death of Mary Kathleen. Why would there have been? Who cared? There was an obituary for the patient Sarah Clewes had lost\u2014the woman with the bad heart. She left three children behind. Her husband had died in an automobile accident a month before, so the children were orphans now.\nAs I was being measured for a suit by Morty Sills, I found it unbearable to think of Mary Kathleen\u2019s not being claimed by anyone. Clyde Carter was there, too, fresh off the plane from Atlanta.

He gets a realistic novel out of the branch library in his neighborhood.

Even the figures in the distance, no bigger than flyspecks, when examined through one of several magnifying glasses I keep in the barn, prove to be concentration-camp victims or slave laborers or prisoners of war from this or that country, or soldiers from this or that military unit on the German side, or local farmers and their families, or lunatics set free from asylums, and on and on.\nThere is a war story to go with every figure in the picture, no matter how small. I made up a story, and then painted the person it had happened to. I at first made myself available in the barn to tell anyone who asked what the story was of this person or that one, but soon gave up in exhaustion. \u201cMake up your own war stories as you look at the whatchamacallit,\u201d I tell people. I stay in the house here, and simply point the way out to the potato barn.\nThat night with Circe Berman, though, I was glad to tell her any of the stories she wished to hear.", 0.13220238095238096], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["eddie", 0.28984600070914757], ["red", 0.1789137657593456], ["letter", 0.08877084560222678], ["plenty", 0.07450882669468996], ["happen", 0.07246150017728689], ["felt", 0.068834425357822], ["daydreamed", 0.06546494596850227], ["confuse", 0.06546494596850227], ["riffled", 0.06546494596850227], ["booming", 0.06546494596850227], ["angered", 0.06546494596850227], ["crest", 0.06546494596850227], ["righteousness", 0.06546494596850227], ["squashing", 0.06546494596850227], ["poise", 0.06546494596850227], ["phony", 0.06546494596850227], ["flow", 0.06546494596850227], ["godliness", 0.06546494596850227], ["stopped", 0.060442073735734174], ["packet", 0.05731027325603233], ["refused", 0.05731027325603233], ["succeeded", 0.05731027325603233], ["bluff", 0.05731027325603233], ["anger", 0.05254009551358334], ["strength", 0.05254009551358334], ["humbly", 0.05254009551358334], ["health", 0.05254009551358334], ["violet", 0.04915560054356238], ["frightened", 0.04915560054356238], ["devoted", 0.04915560054356238], ["rode", 0.04915560054356238], ["begging", 0.04915560054356238], ["letters", 0.04438542280111339], ["hate", 0.04438542280111339], ["writing", 0.04438542280111339], ["charge", 0.04438542280111339], ["growing", 0.04438542280111339], ["dropped", 0.042571885391380945], ["waved", 0.042571885391380945], ["figured", 0.042571885391380945], ["empty", 0.042571885391380945], ["softly", 0.04100092783109244], ["cold", 0.0396152450586644], ["nose", 0.0396152450586644], ["married", 0.0396152450586644], ["hope", 0.03725441334734498], ["loved", 0.03725441334734498], ["kid", 0.036230750088643446], ["picked", 0.03360553183788804], ["stood", 0.03360553183788804], ["suddenly", 0.03213302427372326], ["ago", 0.03213302427372326], ["top", 0.030221036867867087], ["will", 0.029647034936462], ["coming", 0.02909974063487503], ["guess", 0.028076077376173503], ["time", 0.027242380236669184], ["lot", 0.025065096503971145], ["long", 0.02266981467760362], ["things", 0.02149236222399206], ["wasn", 0.020422106009807043], ["told", 0.01875562933847731], ["thing", 0.017899636935154627], ["good", 0.01405967711594908], ["man", 0.011169410476252166]], "sentiment": ["Red saw now how frightened Eddie was, saw how phony his poise and godliness were.

But there you have a problem in relativity again. I continued to be comforted by music of my own making, the scat singing, the brainless inward fusillades of \u201cskeedee wahs\u201d and \u201cbodey oh dohs,\u201d and so on. I had a Blaupunkt FM-AM stereophonic radio in my Mercedes, but I hardly ever turned it on.\nAs for scat singing: I came across what I consider a most amusing graffito, written in ball-point pen on tile in the men\u2019s room at Will Fairchild Memorial Airport one morning. It was dawn, and I was seized by an attack of diarrhea on my way home from work, just as I was passing the airport. It was caused, I\u2019m sure, by my having eaten so many polka-dot brownies before going to work the night before.\nSo I swung into the airport, and jumped out of my four-door Mercedes. I didn\u2019t expect to get into the building. I just wanted to get out of sight. But there was another car in the parking lot at that unlikely hour. So I tried a side door, and it was unlocked.\nIn I flew, and up to the men\u2019s room, noting in flight that somebody was running a floor-waxing machine. I relieved myself, and became as calm and respectable as any other citizen again, or even more so. For a few moments there, I was happier than happy, healthier than healthy, and I saw these words scrawled on the tiles over a wash basin:\n\u201cTo be is to do\u201d\u2014Socrates.\n\u201cTo do is to be\u201d\u2014Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\u201cDo be do be do\u201d\u2014Frank Sinatra.\nEPILOGUE\nI HAVE NOW SEEN with my own eyes what a neutron bomb can do to a small city. I am back at the Hotel Oloffson after three days in my old hometown. Midland City was exactly as I remembered it, except that there were no people living there. The security is excellent. The perimeter of the flash area is marked by a high fence topped with barbed wire, with a watchtower every three hundred yards or so. There is a minefield in front of that, and then a low barbed wire entanglement beyond that, which wouldn\u2019t stop a truly determined person, but which is meant as a friendly warning about the mines.", 0.2927333333333333], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["class", 0.20389998948641316], ["conducted", 0.11669780709554585], ["fled", 0.11669780709554585], ["route", 0.11669780709554585], ["37", 0.11669780709554585], ["courtesy", 0.11669780709554585], ["coalbin", 0.11669780709554585], ["cards", 0.11669780709554585], ["remained", 0.10194999474320658], ["mistress", 0.10194999474320658], ["members", 0.09332307754941586], ["dat", 0.09332307754941586], ["rule", 0.09332307754941586], ["missed", 0.08720218239086731], ["returned", 0.08720218239086731], ["flag", 0.08720218239086731], ["steps", 0.08720218239086731], ["furnace", 0.08245444725652244], ["understood", 0.0785752651970766], ["cellar", 0.07529546349862429], ["playing", 0.07529546349862429], ["golden", 0.07245437003852806], ["constitution", 0.07245437003852806], ["jones", 0.07236626806691038], ["sons", 0.06994834800328587], ["hadn", 0.06567875873813371], ["fact", 0.06382745284473734], ["place", 0.06212441651125783], ["iron", 0.0577065576861888], ["fuehrer", 0.0577065576861888], ["guard", 0.056416672115626364], ["room", 0.0552005356509466], ["best", 0.054050169240940735], ["door", 0.054050169240940735], ["keeley", 0.05295882255184391], ["friend", 0.05093094638579445], ["black", 0.049079640492398074], ["wanted", 0.049079640492398074], ["left", 0.045799838793945766], ["wirtanen", 0.04505321496817406], ["white", 0.0436342495533087], ["knew", 0.04295874533384954], ["father", 0.04105210365960088], ["american", 0.03433182814005881], ["resi", 0.03262879180657931]], "sentiment": ["37\nDAT OLD\nGOLDEN RULE \u2026\nI LEFT WIRTANEN.\nBut I hadn\u2019t taken many steps before I understood that the only place I wanted to be was back in Jones\u2019 cellar with my mistress and my best friend.\nI knew them for what they were, but the fact remained that they were all I had.\nI returned by the same route over which I had fled, went in through Jones\u2019 coalbin door.\nResi, Father Keeley, and the Black Fuehrer were playing cards when I got back.\nNobody had missed me.\nThe Iron Guard of the White Sons of the American Constitution was having a class in flag courtesy in the furnace room, a class conducted by one of its own members.", 0.17948717948717946], "title": "Mother Night"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["organ", 0.19911621423280018], ["glencannon", 0.17639007716526098], ["repair", 0.09955810711640009], ["gibbon", 0.09955810711640009], ["zoo", 0.09955810711640009], ["italy", 0.09955810711640009], ["submarine", 0.09955810711640009], ["panda", 0.09955810711640009], ["transaction", 0.09955810711640009], ["titled", 0.08819503858263049], ["chinese", 0.08819503858263049], ["agrees", 0.08819503858263049], ["apes", 0.08819503858263049], ["timbuktu", 0.08819503858263049], ["beautiful", 0.0865264698234511], ["memories", 0.08154806959725075], ["aired", 0.08154806959725075], ["stiff", 0.08154806959725075], ["pipe", 0.08154806959725075], ["nanny", 0.07816934688480225], ["london", 0.07317387904370992], ["educational", 0.07317387904370992], ["parts", 0.07018500106348115], ["scared", 0.06765794073844413], ["apart", 0.06765794073844413], ["charming", 0.0654689015150913], ["darling", 0.06181081050994032], ["project", 0.06181081050994032], ["takes", 0.06024834854593499], ["reminded", 0.06024834854593499], ["television", 0.05882193252971155], ["post", 0.055163841524560574], ["1971", 0.05311198672203589], ["2", 0.05217496354433181], ["national", 0.04745886399594196], ["sold", 0.04614668846031022], ["birthday", 0.04552799455895206], ["working", 0.04223831102678565], ["piece", 0.04223831102678565], ["idea", 0.04081189501056221], ["happy", 0.036440933317874534], ["mark", 0.03356873513713534], ["story", 0.032993467599245666], ["october", 0.032713230986798125], ["long", 0.030875242493016056], ["knox", 0.026536020292572085], ["thing", 0.025609590616123848], ["year", 0.023900393725559764], ["going", 0.022954355731778668], ["love", 0.0178596379080667], ["good", 0.01354131904819539], ["time", 0.012865204973866713], ["city", 0.009440595226347588], ["york", 0.009108059633372086], ["vonnegut", 0.008399391853850446], ["dear", 0.005253637627455276], ["kurt", 0.004098338337989938]], "sentiment": ["Dear Knox\u2014\nThat\u2019s so beautiful that you sold a piece for Mark.
