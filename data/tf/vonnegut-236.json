Her parish is All Angels\u2014on West Eightieth, just off Broadway. She sold the church but hung on to the parish house. I assume that most, if not all, of the angels are still around.\n\u201cNow, as to the verses about Palm Sunday Eve: I choose them because Jesus says something in the eighth verse which many people I have known have taken as proof that Jesus himself occasionally got sick and tired of people who needed mercy all the time. I read from the Revised Standard Bible rather than the King James, because it is easier for me to understand. Also, I will argue afterward that Jesus was only joking, and it is impossible to joke in King James English. The funniest joke in the world, if told in King James English, is doomed to sound like Charlton Heston.\n\u201cI read:\n\u201c\u2019Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. There they made him a supper; Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him.\n\u201c\u2019Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.\n\u201c\u2019But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was to betray him), said, \u201cWhy was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?\u201d This he said, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box he used to take what was put into it. Jesus said, \u201cLet her alone, let her keep it for the day of my burial. The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.\u201d \u2019\n\u201cThus ends the reading, and although I have promised a joke, there is not much of a chuckle in there anywhere. The reading, in fact, ends with at least two quite depressing implications: That Jesus could be a touch self-pitying, and that he was, with his mission to earth about to end, at least momentarily sick and tired of hearing about the poor.\n\u201cThe King James version of the last verse, by the way, is almost identical: \u2019 \u201cFor the poor always ye have with you; but you do not always have me.\u201d \u2019\n\u201cWhatever it was that Jesus really said to Judas was said in Aramaic, of course\u2014and has come to us through Hebrew and Greek and Latin and archaic English. Maybe he only said something a lot like, The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.\u2019 Perhaps a little something has been lost in translation. And let us remember, too, that in translations jokes are commonly the first things to go.\n\u201cI would like to recapture what has been lost. Why? Because, I, as a Christ-worshiping agnostic, have seen so much un-Christian impatience with the poor encouraged by the quotation, \u2019For the poor always ye have with you.\u2019", -0.13206453634085213], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["stedman", 0.04142011834319527], ["cornelia", 0.03550295857988166], ["paper", 0.023668639053254437], ["knew", 0.023668639053254437], ["husband", 0.023668639053254437], ["art", 0.023668639053254437], ["studio", 0.023668639053254437], ["humbug", 0.01775147928994083], ["tears", 0.011834319526627219], ["gonna", 0.011834319526627219], ["awful", 0.011834319526627219], ["good", 0.011834319526627219], ["people", 0.011834319526627219], ["ten", 0.011834319526627219], ["weeping", 0.011834319526627219], ["called", 0.011834319526627219], ["high", 0.011834319526627219], ["wife", 0.011834319526627219], ["painting", 0.011834319526627219], ["sentence", 0.005917159763313609], ["pointed", 0.005917159763313609], ["years", 0.005917159763313609], ["dreadful", 0.005917159763313609], ["representing", 0.005917159763313609], ["window", 0.005917159763313609], ["peculiar", 0.005917159763313609], ["painters", 0.005917159763313609], ["spoken", 0.005917159763313609], ["exhibition", 0.005917159763313609], ["speech", 0.005917159763313609], ["passed", 0.005917159763313609], ["instantly", 0.005917159763313609], ["woman", 0.005917159763313609], ["mercy", 0.005917159763313609], ["showing", 0.005917159763313609], ["speechless", 0.005917159763313609], ["cataclysm", 0.005917159763313609], ["iridescent", 0.005917159763313609], ["hands", 0.005917159763313609], ["bit", 0.005917159763313609], ["association", 0.005917159763313609], ["bewildered", 0.005917159763313609], ["shy", 0.005917159763313609], ["magnitude", 0.005917159763313609], ["unevenly", 0.005917159763313609], ["shocking", 0.005917159763313609], ["em", 0.005917159763313609], ["crowd", 0.005917159763313609], ["scared", 0.005917159763313609], ["lips", 0.005917159763313609], ["street", 0.005917159763313609], ["wonder", 0.005917159763313609], ["palette", 0.005917159763313609], ["stood", 0.005917159763313609], ["paintings", 0.005917159763313609], ["pictures", 0.005917159763313609], ["closed", 0.005917159763313609], ["full", 0.005917159763313609], ["led", 0.005917159763313609], ["drew", 0.005917159763313609], ["admits", 0.005917159763313609], ["sixty", 0.005917159763313609], ["precious", 0.005917159763313609], ["wait", 0.005917159763313609], ["talent", 0.005917159763313609], ["couldn", 0.005917159763313609], ["annual", 0.005917159763313609], ["days", 0.005917159763313609], ["thing", 0.005917159763313609], ["trailer", 0.005917159763313609], ["opinion", 0.005917159763313609], ["tongue", 0.005917159763313609], ["plainly", 0.005917159763313609], ["appeared", 0.005917159763313609], ["sweet", 0.005917159763313609], ["brush", 0.005917159763313609], ["sounds", 0.005917159763313609], ["finally", 0.005917159763313609], ["muck", 0.005917159763313609], ["fought", 0.005917159763313609], ["expected", 0.005917159763313609], ["white", 0.005917159763313609], ["perfectly", 0.005917159763313609], ["abstract", 0.005917159763313609], ["affectionate", 0.005917159763313609], ["life", 0.005917159763313609], ["lived", 0.005917159763313609], ["door", 0.005917159763313609], ["lot", 0.005917159763313609], ["offered", 0.005917159763313609], ["rejected", 0.005917159763313609], ["coherent", 0.005917159763313609], ["highlands", 0.005917159763313609], ["understand", 0.005917159763313609], ["broke", 0.005917159763313609], ["housewives", 0.005917159763313609], ["entered", 0.005917159763313609], ["painter", 0.005917159763313609], ["tonight", 0.005917159763313609], ["kind", 0.005917159763313609], ["suddenly", 0.005917159763313609], ["supposed", 0.005917159763313609], ["beautiful", 0.005917159763313609], ["wakes", 0.005917159763313609], ["taste", 0.005917159763313609], ["universal", 0.005917159763313609], ["moved", 0.005917159763313609], ["quiet", 0.005917159763313609], ["critic", 0.005917159763313609], ["evening", 0.005917159763313609], ["loosened", 0.005917159763313609], ["throat", 0.005917159763313609], ["kissed", 0.005917159763313609], ["seminole", 0.005917159763313609], ["huge", 0.005917159763313609], ["muckety", 0.005917159763313609], ["lip", 0.005917159763313609], ["nice", 0.005917159763313609], ["picture", 0.005917159763313609], ["drink", 0.005917159763313609], ["birthday", 0.005917159763313609], ["man", 0.005917159763313609], ["land", 0.005917159763313609], ["longer", 0.005917159763313609], ["humble", 0.005917159763313609], ["trembling", 0.005917159763313609], ["thought", 0.005917159763313609], ["tenderly", 0.005917159763313609], ["greatest", 0.005917159763313609], ["position", 0.005917159763313609]], "sentiment": ["Cornelia, he supposed, was still weeping in the trailer behind the studio\u2014was still weeping over the evening paper.

[\u2026] We\u2019ll both be around. I\u2019m going to a P.E.N. meeting in Vienna in a couple of weeks. That\u2019s all the traveling for me this year. I\u2019m surprised that you expect to see a production of Slaughterhouse-Five in Moscow. The most recent information I had on that was that it had been cancelled\u2014probably because I, as an officer of P.E.N., sent a cable to the Writer\u2019s Union, asking them to do all they could to protect the rights of Amalrik.\nRita, I know, feels that such cables should not be sent, since they cripple efforts to produce good American books and plays over there. P.E.N. knows this, but has decided to keep up its complaints about the mistreatment of writers anyway. It\u2019s a tough choice to have to make. I think we\u2019ve made the right one.\nYou might tell Rita that many writers (in Iran, Korea, Greece, Yugoslavia, and so on) have told P.E.N., after getting out of prison or whatever, that P.E.N.\u2019s strident interest in them had a lot to do with their staying alive. We are, incidentally, supporting financially about a dozen Czech writers who are not allowed to publish at all, who can\u2019t even get jobs as janitors. Hi ho.\nTell her, too, that we have all agreed to pretend to celebrate \u201cThe Spirit of Helsinki\u201d as though it were a wonderful new liberalization of relationships between artists and intellectuals of the East and West. We mention it glowingly in speeches and toasts and so on.
