I am glad to hear you in such boisterous spirits.\nNot only did I read the whole letter\u2014I read the books, too. $5,267.49 to Gehman! Yummy! That is certainly a grand advance. Driven, incidentally, is regarded as a damn fine book in these parts, and is the main reason Jane likes Gehman.\nI will review all the books if you want me to, but I gather that what you\u2019re after is a book by me. Well sir, just before taking off for Blighty on Sunday I will put into the hands of my typist some more pages. She will mail them directly to you whenever she gets them done.\nHow do these sons of bitches write thirteen books, or thirty-three, for Christ\u2019s sakes\u2014or sell serials to the Post and then to the movies? Twenty million copies of the Shell Scott books in print. That was a pretty damn demoralizing letter you wrote, now that I think of it.\nI will tell you a true story. There is a little old nothing old lady in Indianapolis who kept telling Jane\u2019s mother that we should call on some relative of hers while we were in England. We told Jane\u2019s mother we wouldn\u2019t have time for dull calling, but Jane\u2019s mother forgot to tell the little old lady, so she put the plan into operation, and we are expected to come calling on the relative. [\u2026] The relative is having a cocktail party to which we are invited, and he is eager to do all he can to make our visit to London interesting. You know who he turns out to be? The cultural attache of the American Embassy, and the cocktail party is a big blast for all the top London theatrical people.

they matter anymore, have been either swoopers or bashers. Swoopers write a story quickly, higgledy-piggledy, crinkum-crankum, any which way. Then they go over it again painstakingly, fixing everything that is just plain awful or doesn\u2019t work. Bashers go one sentence at a time, getting it exactly right before they go on to the next one. When they\u2019re done they\u2019re done.\nI am a basher. Most men are bashers, and most women are swoopers. Again: Somebody should look into this. It may be that writers of either sex are born to be swoopers or bashers. I visited Rockefeller University recently, and they are seeking and finding more and more genes that tend to make us behave this way or that way, just as a rerun after a timequake would do. Even before that visit, it had appeared to me that Jane\u2019s and my children and Allie\u2019s and Jim\u2019s children, while not alike as grownups, had each become the sort of grownups they practically had to be.\nAll six are OK.\nThen again, all six have had countless opportunities to be OK. If you can believe what you read in the papers, or what you hear and see on TV and the Information Superhighway, most people don\u2019t.\nWriters who are swoopers, it seems to me, find it wonderful that people are funny or tragic or whatever, worth reporting, without wondering why or how people are alive in the first place.\nBashers, while ostensibly making sentence after sentence as efficient as possible, may actually be breaking down seeming doors and fences, cutting their ways through seeming barbed-wire entanglements, under fire and in an atmosphere of mustard gas, in search of answers to these eternal questions: \u201cWhat in heck should we be doing? What in heck is really going on?\u201d\nIf bashers are unwilling to settle for the basher Voltaire\u2019s \u201cIl faut cultiver notre jardin, \u201d that leaves the politics of human rights, which I am prepared to discuss. I begin with a couple of true stories from the end of Trout\u2019s and my war in Europe.\nHere\u2019s the thing: For a few days after Germany surrendered, on May 7th, 1945, having been directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of maybe forty million people, there was a pocket of anarchy south of Dresden, near the Czech border, which had yet to be occupied and policed by troops of the Soviet Union. I was in it, and have described it some in my novel Bluebeard.

Touch\u00e9, touch\u00e9.\nCHAPTER 5\nThe Calvin Theater there in Northampton is named in honor of Calvin Coolidge, the thirtieth president of the United States. He was born and raised nearby. When the American humorist Dorothy Parker was told in 1933 that Coolidge was dead, she said, \u201cHow can they tell?\u201d\nYes, and catty-corner and across the street from the Calvin is the Hotel Northampton, where Gil Berman had hired a room for one night only. A car and driver from a limo service had brought him from Manhattan, and the driver had a room in the same hotel. The plan was that they would go to Knightsbridge the next morning, where Berman would try yet again to strike some sort of bargain with his childhood home. At least it was empty now, and it was his, all his. He could fucking well, in his own words, \u201cput out a contract on it, call in the wreckers, if it still won\u2019t stop putting crazy messages in my head like the CIA.\u201d\nBerman could easily afford such expensive transportation. And he no more needed the fees he got for public appearances than his father had needed what he was paid for orthodontics. He and the driver, Don, had not become friends on the trip. Berman had not wanted to talk, but preferred to daydream, snooze, or simply take in the scenery. He was not one to befriend those who drove him. He said to one driver who tried to strike up a lively conversation, \u201cLook, I\u2019m trying to think back here. If I need a Sancho Panza, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\nAt the end of the trip that driver said, \u201cJust one question, Mr. Berman, if it won\u2019t interrupt your chain of thought too much. Who the heck was Sancho Panza? A baseball star?\u201d\nAfter Martha Jones\u2019s niece got her aunt out of front row center in the Calvin and into the family Honda out front and headed for Ithaca, Berman returned to his hotel room on the third floor. He found himself phoning Dr. Walter Streit, the psychiatrist who had replaced Dr. Klein back in Wisconsin, back at Caldwell. During his drug years, he regularly called up this acquaintance or that one, twice his congressperson, without knowing why, and then waited to see what would come pouring out of him. In a Rolling Stone interview back then, he said: \u201cTo me a telephone is like a bung in a barrel, only I\u2019m the barrel. When the person answers I just turn on the bung, and what comes out is almost always new material, wonderful stuff I\u2019ve never heard before. I laugh like hell, and so does the guy on the other end.\u201d", 0.047972370766488415], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["billy", 0.056338028169014086],

They told him that there could be no Earthling babies without male homosexuals. There could be babies without female homosexuals. There couldn\u2019t be babies without women over sixty-five years old. There could be babies without men over sixty-five. There couldn\u2019t be babies without other babies who had lived an hour or less after birth. And so on.\nIt was gibberish to Billy.\nThere was a lot that Billy said that was gibberish to the Tralfamadorians, too. They couldn\u2019t imagine what time looked like to him. Billy had given up on explaining that. The guide outside had to explain as best he could.\nThe guide invited the crowd to imagine that they were looking across a desert at a mountain range on a day that was twinkling bright and clear. They could look at a peak or a bird or a cloud, at a stone right in front of them, or even down into a canyon behind them. But among them was this poor Earthling, and his head was encased in a steel sphere which he could never take off. There was only one eyehole through which he could look, and welded to that eyehole were six feet of pipe.\nThis was only the beginning of Billy\u2019s miseries in the metaphor. He was also strapped to a steel lattice which was bolted to a flatcar on rails, and there was no way he could turn his head or touch the pipe. The far end of the pipe rested on a bi-pod which was also bolted to the flatcar. All Billy could see was the little dot at the end of the pipe. He didn\u2019t know he was on a flatcar, didn\u2019t even know there was anything peculiar about his situation.\nThe flatcar sometimes crept, sometimes went extremely fast, often stopped\u2014went uphill, downhill, around curves, along straightaways. Whatever poor Billy saw through the pipe, he had no choice but to say to himself, \u201cThat\u2019s life.\u201d\nBilly expected the Tralfamadorians to be baffled and alarmed by all the wars and other forms of murder on Earth. He expected them to fear that the Earthling combination of ferocity and spectacular weaponry might eventually destroy part or maybe all of the innocent Universe. Science fiction had led him to expect that.\nBut the subject of war never came up until Billy brought it up himself. Somebody in the zoo crowd asked him through the lecturer what the most valuable thing he had learned on Tralfamadore was so far, and Billy replied, \u201cHow the inhabitants of a whole planet can live in peace! As you know, I am from a planet that has been engaged in senseless slaughter since the beginning of time. I myself have seen the bodies of schoolgirls who were boiled alive in a water tower by my own countrymen, who were proud of fighting pure evil at the time.\u201d This was true. Billy saw the boiled bodies in Dresden. \u201cAnd I have lit my way in a prison at night with candles from the fat of human beings who were butchered by the brothers and fathers of those schoolgirls who were boiled. Earthlings must be the terrors of the Universe! If other planets aren\u2019t now in danger from Earth, they soon will be. So tell me the secret so I can take it back to Earth and save us all: How can a planet live at peace?\u201d\nBilly felt that he had spoken soaringly. He was baffled when he saw the Tralfamadorians close their little hands on their eyes. He knew from past experience what this meant: He was being stupid.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.03878905332393704], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["unk", 0.11764705882352941], ["best", 0.08823529411764706], ["hospital", 0.06862745098039216], ["told", 0.0392156862745098], ["wouldn", 0.029411764705882353], ["face", 0.029411764705882353], ["recognize", 0.0196078431372549], ["sergeant", 0.0196078431372549], ["oxygen", 0.0196078431372549], ["soldier", 0.0196078431372549], ["atmosphere", 0.00980392156862745], ["illness", 0.00980392156862745], ["mental", 0.00980392156862745], ["division", 0.00980392156862745], ["wasn", 0.00980392156862745], ["mind", 0.00980392156862745], ["rations", 0.00980392156862745], ["symbols", 0.00980392156862745], ["grades", 0.00980392156862745], ["regiment", 0.00980392156862745], ["blank", 0.00980392156862745], ["goofballs", 0.00980392156862745], ["martian", 0.00980392156862745], ["battalion", 0.00980392156862745], ["find", 0.00980392156862745], ["movements", 0.00980392156862745], ["platoon", 0.00980392156862745], ["hadn", 0.00980392156862745], ["teach", 0.00980392156862745], ["stake", 0.00980392156862745], ["arms", 0.00980392156862745], ["pills", 0.00980392156862745], ["specialties", 0.00980392156862745], ["squad", 0.00980392156862745], ["recognition", 0.00980392156862745], ["pretty", 0.00980392156862745], ["memory", 0.00980392156862745], ["friend", 0.00980392156862745], ["good", 0.00980392156862745], ["sick", 0.00980392156862745], ["combat", 0.00980392156862745], ["company", 0.00980392156862745], ["hours", 0.00980392156862745], ["suffocate", 0.00980392156862745], ["base", 0.00980392156862745], ["formation", 0.00980392156862745], ["foot", 0.00980392156862745], ["news", 0.00980392156862745], ["blanked", 0.00980392156862745], ["pity", 0.00980392156862745], ["boy", 0.00980392156862745], ["discharged", 0.00980392156862745], ["respiratory", 0.00980392156862745], ["couldn", 0.00980392156862745], ["ranks", 0.00980392156862745], ["fully", 0.00980392156862745], ["straight", 0.00980392156862745], ["army", 0.00980392156862745], ["manual", 0.00980392156862745], ["guessed", 0.00980392156862745], ["crr", 0.00980392156862745], ["recovered", 0.00980392156862745], ["blooming", 0.00980392156862745], ["treated", 0.00980392156862745], ["explain", 0.00980392156862745], ["fact", 0.00980392156862745]], "sentiment": ["He couldn\u2019t find Unk\u2019s face.\nIf he had found Unk\u2019s face, there wouldn\u2019t have been any blooming of recognition and pity on Unk\u2019s face.

Cruise of the Century.\u201d He had stolen all that food for his family at dawn that day, long before the troops and the hungry mob arrived.\nHis vehicle, which he had bought with graft from the outfitting and provisioning of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, had the same name as the hotel\u2014the same name as the legendary city of great riches and opportunity which his Spanish ancestors had sought but never found. His ancestors used to torture Indians\u2014to make them tell where El Dorado was.\nIt is hard to imagine anybody\u2019s torturing anybody nowadays. How could you even capture somebody you wanted to torture with just your flippers and your mouth? How could you even stage a manhunt, now that people can swim so fast and stay underwater for so long? The person you were after would not only look pretty much like everybody else, but could also be hiding out at any depth practically anywhere.\nHernando Cruz had done his bit for humanity.\nThe Peruvian Air Force would soon do its bit, as well, but not until six o\u2019clock that evening, after *Andrew MacIntosh and *Zenji Hiroguchi were dead\u2014at which time Peru would declare war on Ecuador. Peru had been bankrupt for fourteen days longer than Ecuador, so that hunger was that much more advanced there. Ground soldiers were going home, and taking their weapons with them. Only the small Peruvian Air Force was still reliable, and the military junta was keeping it that way by giving its members the best of whatever food was still around.\nOne thing which made the Air Force such a high morale unit was that its equipment, bought on credit and delivered before the bankruptcy, was so up to date. It had eight new French fighter-bombers and each of these planes, moreover, was equipped with an American air-to-ground missile with a Japanese brain which could home in on radar signals, or on heat from an engine, depending on instructions from the pilot. The pilot was in turn being instructed by computers on the ground and in his cockpit. The warhead of each missile carried a new Israeli explosive which was capable of creating one fifth as much devastation as the atomic bomb the United States dropped on the mother of Hisako Hiroguchi during World War Two. This new explosive was regarded as a great boon to big-brained military scientists. As long as they killed people with conventional rather than nuclear weapons, they were praised as humanitarian statesmen. As long as they did not use nuclear weapons, it appeared, nobody was going to give the right name to all the killing that had been going on since the end of the Second World War, which was surely \u201cWorld War Three.\u201d\nThe Peruvian junta gave this as its official reason for going to war: that the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were rightfully Peru\u2019s, and that Peru was going to get them back again.\nNobody today is nearly smart enough to make the sorts of weapons even the poorest nations had a million years ago. Yes, and they were being used all the time. During my entire lifetime, there wasn\u2019t a day when, somewhere on the planet, there weren\u2019t at least three wars going on.\nAnd the Law of Natural Selection was powerless to respond to such new technologies. No female of any species, unless, maybe, she was a rhinoceros, could expect to give birth to a baby who was fireproof, bombproof, or bulletproof.\nThe best that the Law of Natural Selection could come up with in my time was somebody who wasn\u2019t afraid of anything, even though there was so much to fear. I knew a few people like that in Vietnam\u2014to the extent that such people were knowable.

Today was going to be my birthday, but I was hit by an ice-cream truck before I could have my party. I am dead now. I am in Heaven. That is why my parents did not pick up the cake at the bakery. I am not mad at the ice-cream truck driver, even though he was drunk when he hit me. It didn't hurt much. It wasn't even as bad as the sting of a bumblebee. I am really happy here! It's so much fun. I am glad the driver was drunk. If he hadn't been, I might not have got to Heaven for years and years and years. I would have had to go to high school first, and then beauty college. I would have had to get married and have babies and everything. Now I can just play and play and play. Any time I want any pink cotton candy I can have some. Everybody up here is happy-the animals and the dead soldiers and people who went to the electric chair and everything. They're all glad for whatever sent them here. Nobody is mad. We're all too busy playing shuffleboard. So if you think of killing somebody, don't worry about it. Just go ahead and do it. Whoever you do it to should kiss you for doing it. The soldiers up here just love the shrapnel and the tanks and the bayonets and the dum dums that let them play shuffleboard all the time--and drink beer.", 0.14590000000000003], "title": "Happy Birthday, Wanda June"}, "god-bless-you-mr-rosewater": {"tfidf": [["merrihue", 0.033783783783783786], ["abraham", 0.033783783783783786], ["fred", 0.02702702702702703], ["father", 0.02027027027027027], ["begat", 0.02027027027027027], ["manuscript", 0.013513513513513514], ["read", 0.013513513513513514], ["missionary", 0.013513513513513514], ["rootless", 0.013513513513513514], ["fortune", 0.013513513513513514], ["married", 0.013513513513513514], ["house", 0.013513513513513514], ["family", 0.013513513513513514], ["history", 0.013513513513513514], ["lavinia", 0.013513513513513514], ["pisquontuit", 0.013513513513513514], ["congregationalist", 0.013513513513513514], ["suicides", 0.006756756756756757], ["shot", 0.006756756756756757], ["money", 0.006756756756756757], ["cynthia", 0.006756756756756757], ["zing", 0.006756756756756757], ["kill", 0.006756756756756757], ["fishing", 0.006756756756756757], ["find", 0.006756756756756757], ["streetlights", 0.006756756756756757], ["acres", 0.006756756756756757], ["incurious", 0.006756756756756757], ["suspect", 0.006756756756756757], ["characteristically", 0.006756756756756757], ["triangle", 0.006756756756756757], ["returned", 0.006756756756756757], ["lacking", 0.006756756756756757], ["aversions", 0.006756756756756757], ["big", 0.006756756756756757], ["nation", 0.006756756756756757], ["sons", 0.006756756756756757], ["listlessnesses", 0.006756756756756757], ["birth", 0.006756756756756757], ["accepted", 0.006756756756756757], ["killed", 0.006756756756756757], ["lost", 0.006756756756756757], ["harbor", 0.006756756756756757], ["seldom", 0.006756756756756757], ["tend", 0.006756756756756757], ["pavement", 0.006756756756756757], ["wrote", 0.006756756756756757], ["bantu", 0.006756756756756757], ["blew", 0.006756756756756757], ["scruffy", 0.006756756756756757], ["ten", 0.006756756756756757], ["village", 0.006756756756756757], ["1929", 0.006756756756756757], ["insurance", 0.006756756756756757], ["sandy", 0.006756756756756757], ["lots", 0.006756756756756757], ["poison", 0.006756756756756757], ["milk", 0.006756756756756757], ["pulpit", 0.006756756756756757], ["bought", 0.006756756756756757], ["notoriously", 0.006756756756756757], ["cupboard", 0.006756756756756757], ["met", 0.006756756756756757], ["surely", 0.006756756756756757], ["extent", 0.006756756756756757], ["wanted", 0.006756756756756757], ["daughter", 0.006756756756756757], ["island", 0.006756756756756757], ["jelly", 0.006756756756756757], ["parson", 0.006756756756756757], ["blown", 0.006756756756756757], ["feel", 0.006756756756756757], ["twitches", 0.006756756756756757], ["son", 0.006756756756756757], ["congo", 0.006756756756756757], ["sewers", 0.006756756756756757], ["george", 0.006756756756756757], ["rumfoord", 0.006756756756756757], ["numbly", 0.006756756756756757], ["top", 0.006756756756756757], ["rhode", 0.006756756756756757], ["call", 0.006756756756756757], ["squeamishly", 0.006756756756756757], ["lot", 0.006756756756756757], ["minor", 0.006756756756756757], ["life", 0.006756756756756757], ["niles", 0.006756756756756757], ["brains", 0.006756756756756757], ["triangular", 0.006756756756756757], ["grisly", 0.006756756756756757], ["minister", 0.006756756756756757], ["case", 0.006756756756756757], ["baptist", 0.006756756756756757], ["will", 0.006756756756756757], ["future", 0.006756756756756757], ["heiress", 0.006756756756756757], ["piece", 0.006756756756756757], ["head", 0.006756756756756757], ["heard", 0.006756756756756757], ["rat", 0.006756756756756757], ["crash", 0.006756756756756757], ["nursed", 0.006756756756756757], ["syndrome", 0.006756756756756757], ["divided", 0.006756756756756757], ["hypotenuse", 0.006756756756756757], ["illinois", 0.006756756756756757], ["special", 0.006756756756756757], ["poor", 0.006756756756756757], ["cellar", 0.006756756756756757], ["waters", 0.006756756756756757], ["invested", 0.006756756756756757], ["lay", 0.006756756756756757], ["lap", 0.006756756756756757], ["died", 0.006756756756756757], ["man", 0.006756756756756757], ["realtor", 0.006756756756756757], ["land", 0.006756756756756757], ["wife", 0.006756756756756757], ["woodlot", 0.006756756756756757], ["shore", 0.006756756756756757], ["jungle", 0.006756756756756757]], "sentiment": ["And George begat Abraham, who became a Congregationalist minister. Abraham went as a missionary to the Congo, where he met and married Lavinia Waters, the daughter of another missionary, an Illinois Baptist.\nIn the jungle, Abraham begat Merrihue. Lavinia died at Merrihue's birth. Little Merrihue was nursed on the milk of a Bantu.\nAnd Abraham and little Merrihue returned to Rhode Island. Abraham accepted the call to the Congregationalist pulpit in the little fishing village of Pisquontuit. He bought a little house, and with that house came one hundred ten acres of scruffy, sandy woodlot. It was a triangular lot. The hypotenuse of the triangle lay on the shore of Pisquontuit Harbor.\nMerrihue, the Parson's son, became a realtor, divided his father's land into lots. He married Cynthia Niles Rumfoord, a minor heiress, invested much of her money in pavement and streetlights and sewers. He made a fortune, lost it, and his wife's fortune, too, in the crash of 1929.\nHe blew his brains out.\nBut, before he did that, he wrote a family history and he begat poor Fred, the insurance man.\nSons of suicides seldom do well.\nCharacteristically, they find life lacking a certain zing. They tend to feel more rootless than most, even in a notoriously rootless nation. They are squeamishly incurious about the past and numbly certain about the future to this grisly extent: they suspect that they, too, will probably kill themselves.\nThe syndrome was surely Fred's. And to it he added twitches, aversions and listlessnesses special to his own case. He had heard the shot that killed his father, had seen his father with a big piece of his head blown away, with the manuscript of the family history in his lap.\nFred had the manuscript, which he had never read, which he never wanted to read. It was on top of a jelly cupboard in the cellar of Fred's home. That was where he kept the rat poison, too.", 0.12551020408163266], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["mccone", 0.03333333333333333], ["day", 0.023809523809523808],

that,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember how happy I was the next day. I can\u2019t help wondering now if we weren\u2019t just a little insane. I don\u2019t mean that we were insane to miss a wonderful party or to hurt the feelings of Daniel McCone. Daniel McCone was a perfectly ghastly man. What was insane was the way we all imagined that God was watching, and simply adoring us, guaranteeing us all seats at His right hand for having snubbed Daniel McCone.\u201d\nI asked her what had become of the McCone mansion in Bar Harbor. My mentor had never mentioned it to me.\n\u201cMr. and Mrs. McCone vanished from Bar Harbor the next day,\u201d she said, \u201cwith their two young sons, I believe.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. One son became my mentor. The other son became chairman of the board and president of Cuyahoga Bridge and Iron.\n\u201cA month later,\u201d she said, \u201caround Labor Day, although there was no Labor Day then\u2014when summer was about to end\u2014a special train arrived. There were perhaps eight freight cars and three cars of workmen, who had come all the way from Cleveland. They must have been from Mr. McCone\u2019s factory. How pale they looked! They were almost all foreigners, I remember\u2014Germans, Poles, Italians, Hungarians. Who could tell? There had never been such people in Bar Harbor before. They slept on the train. They ate on the train. They allowed themselves to be herded like to her. They, too, had been the brainstorm of Alexander Hamilton McCone.\n\u201cYou are so beautiful!\u201d I said, rising raptly from my folding chair. It was true, surely, for she was tall and slender and golden-haired\u2014and blue-eyed. Her skin was like satin. Her teeth were like pearls. But she radiated about as much sexuality as her grandmother\u2019s card table.\nThis would continue to be the case for the next seven years. Sarah Wyatt believed that sex was a sort of pratfall that was easily avoided. To avoid it, she had only to remind a would-be lover of the ridiculousness of what he proposed to do to her. The first time I kissed her, which was in Wellesley the week before, I suddenly found myself being played like a tuba, to speak. Sarah was convulsed by laughter, with her lips still pressed to mine. She tickled me. She pulled out my shirttails, leaving me in humiliating disarray. It was terrible. Nor was her laughter about sexuality girlish and nervous, something a man might be expected to modulate with tenderness and anatomical skill. It was the unbridled hee-hawing of somebody at a Marx Brothers film.\nA phrase keeps asking to be used at this point: \u201cnobody home.\u201d\nIt was in fact a phrase used by a Harvard classmate who also took Sarah out, but only twice, as I recall. I asked him what he thought of her, and he replied with some bitterness: \u201cnobody home!\u201d He was Kyle Denny, a football player from Philadelphia. Somebody told me recently that Kyle died in a fall in his bathtub on the day the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. He cracked his head open on a faucet.\nSo I can fix the date of Kyle Denny\u2019s death with pinpoint accuracy: December the seventh, Nineteen-hundred and Forty-one.", 0.0632936507936508], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["kitchen", 0.033707865168539325], ["krebbs", 0.02247191011235955], ["cat", 0.02247191011235955], ["apartment", 0.02247191011235955], ["dispose", 0.011235955056179775], ["spiritual", 0.011235955056179775], ["set", 0.011235955056179775], ["begged", 0.011235955056179775], ["angel", 0.011235955056179775], ["bed", 0.011235955056179775], ["debauch", 0.011235955056179775], ["national", 0.011235955056179775], ["sign", 0.011235955056179775], ["mine", 0.011235955056179775], ["yellow", 0.011235955056179775], ["jesus", 0.011235955056179775], ["medicine", 0.011235955056179775], ["worth", 0.011235955056179775], ["blond", 0.011235955056179775], ["close", 0.011235955056179775], ["message", 0.011235955056179775], ["eyes", 0.011235955056179775], ["chicken", 0.011235955056179775], ["bomb", 0.011235955056179775], ["complete", 0.011235955056179775], ["platinum", 0.011235955056179775], ["poem", 0.011235955056179775], ["puzzling", 0.011235955056179775], ["floor", 0.011235955056179775], ["nuclear", 0.011235955056179775], ["wrecked", 0.011235955056179775], ["torn", 0.011235955056179775], ["avocado", 0.011235955056179775], ["three", 0.011235955056179775], ["long", 0.011235955056179775], ["couch", 0.011235955056179775], ["painters", 0.011235955056179775], ["fire", 0.011235955056179775], ["written", 0.011235955056179775], ["chairman", 0.011235955056179775], ["poets", 0.011235955056179775], ["party", 0.011235955056179775], ["proved", 0.011235955056179775], ["ilium", 0.011235955056179775], ["war", 0.011235955056179775], ["friend", 0.011235955056179775], ["happened", 0.011235955056179775], ["bearded", 0.011235955056179775], ["door", 0.011235955056179775], ["returned", 0.011235955056179775], ["cocktail", 0.011235955056179775], ["hung", 0.011235955056179775], ["shelter", 0.011235955056179775], ["tree", 0.011235955056179775], ["wallpaper", 0.011235955056179775], ["linoleum", 0.011235955056179775], ["cabinet", 0.011235955056179775], ["nihilistic", 0.011235955056179775], ["met", 0.011235955056179775], ["unclaimed", 0.011235955056179775], ["feminine", 0.011235955056179775], ["hand", 0.011235955056179775], ["killed", 0.011235955056179775], ["dead", 0.011235955056179775], ["man", 0.011235955056179775], ["distance", 0.011235955056179775], ["stone", 0.011235955056179775], ["twanging", 0.011235955056179775], ["gay", 0.011235955056179775], ["places", 0.011235955056179775], ["calls", 0.011235955056179775], ["presented", 0.011235955056179775], ["excrement", 0.011235955056179775], ["dollars", 0.011235955056179775], ["implications", 0.011235955056179775], ["meow", 0.011235955056179775], ["spaniel", 0.011235955056179775], ["leaving", 0.011235955056179775], ["will", 0.011235955056179775], ["lipstick", 0.011235955056179775], ["licken", 0.011235955056179775], ["neck", 0.011235955056179775], ["wrote", 0.011235955056179775], ["proof", 0.011235955056179775]], "sentiment": ["Krebbs was a bearded man, a platinum blond Jesus with spaniel eyes.

That was what I found unbearable when Jason Wilder played back my words to me. I was so drunk that I acted like a victim!\nTHE SCENES OF unspeakable cruelty and stupidity and waste I described that night were no more horrible than ultrarealistic shows about Vietnam, which had become staples of TV entertainment. When I told the students about the severed human head I saw nestled in the guts of a water buffalo, to them, I\u2019m sure, the head might as well have been made of wax, and the guts those of some big animal which may or may not have belonged to a real water buffalo.\nWhat difference could it make whether the head was or was not wax, or whether the guts were or were not those of a water buffalo?\nNo difference.\n\u201cPROFESSOR HARTKE,\u201d JASON Wilder said to me gently, reasonably, when the tape had reached its end, \u201cwhy on Earth would you want to tell such tales to young people who need to love their country?\u201d\nI wanted to keep my job so much, and the house which came with it, that my reply was asinine. \u201cI was telling them history,\u201d I said, \u201cand I had had a little too much to drink.

He was a fellow pianist. And then he said, \u201cFirst of all, you were not hired to teach History. Second of all, the students who come to Tarkington need no further instructions in how it feels to be defeated. They would not be here if they themselves had not failed and failed.

The statues were removing one another\u2019s chains with hammers and hacksaws. Tourists were told that real slaves had at one time used the cave after escaping to freedom across the Ohio River.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe story about the slaves was as fake as the one about Jesse James. The cave wasn\u2019t discovered until 1937, when a small earthquake opened it up a crack. Dwayne Hoover himself discovered the crack, and then he and his stepfather opened it with crowbars and dynamite. Before that, not even small animals had been in there.\nThe only connection the cave had with slavery was this: the farm on which it was discovered was started by an ex-slave, Josephus Hoobler. He was freed by his master, and he came north and started the farm. Then he went back and bought his mother and a woman who became his wife.\nTheir descendants continued to run the farm until the Great Depression, when the Midland County Merchants Bank foreclosed on the mortgage. And then Dwayne\u2019s stepfather was hit by an automobile driven by a white man who had bought the farm. In an out-of-court settlement for his injuries, Dwayne\u2019s stepfather was given what he called contemptuously \u201c\u2026 a God damn Nigger farm.\u201d\nDwayne remembered the first trip the family took to see it.

It had been turned into heat.\nThe surface of West Virginia, with its coal and trees and topsoil gone, was rearranging what was left of itself in conformity with the laws of gravity. It was collapsing into all the holes which had been dug into it. Its mountains, which had once found it easy to stand by themselves, were sliding into valleys now.\nThe demolition of West Virginia had taken place with the approval of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the State Government, which drew their power from the people.", 0.06150793650793651], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["ivy", 0.10204081632653061], ["elmer", 0.10204081632653061], ["trap", 0.061224489795918366], ["speak", 0.04081632653061224], ["going", 0.04081632653061224], ["ethelbert", 0.04081632653061224], ["life", 0.04081632653061224], ["ain", 0.04081632653061224], ["real", 0.02040816326530612], ["scratch", 0.02040816326530612], ["image", 0.02040816326530612], ["unicorns", 0.02040816326530612], ["gently", 0.02040816326530612], ["talking", 0.02040816326530612], ["dumb", 0.02040816326530612], ["earth", 0.02040816326530612], ["knowledge", 0.02040816326530612], ["rims", 0.02040816326530612], ["better", 0.02040816326530612], ["tears", 0.02040816326530612], ["fool", 0.02040816326530612], ["eyes", 0.02040816326530612], ["patient", 0.02040816326530612], ["shhhhh", 0.02040816326530612], ["formed", 0.02040816326530612], ["understand", 0.02040816326530612], ["unicorn", 0.02040816326530612], ["boy", 0.02040816326530612], ["word", 0.02040816326530612], ["imagination", 0.02040816326530612], ["twigs", 0.02040816326530612], ["mother", 0.02040816326530612], ["hung", 0.02040816326530612], ["piece", 0.02040816326530612]], "sentiment": ["\u201cShhhhh,\u201d said Elmer gently. \u201cI\u2019m talking to your mother now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like that fool unicorn trap,\u201d said Ivy. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that, neither.
