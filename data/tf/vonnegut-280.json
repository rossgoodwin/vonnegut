love, is what made me decide to marry again: I spoke a couple of weeks ago at the funeral for the often great American writer James T. Farrell. His masterpiece was Studs Lonigan. The woman he had lived with for the past fifteen years, who had not only saved his life but had made him as happy as a puppy, was accorded no honors as a widow, since he had never made her officially his wife. That was so unfair.\nSome people, in telling of my adventures and mis-adventures of the past ten years, have made them conform to the conventions of a Gothic romance, with plenty of wickedness and goodness and innocence and cunning and high living and simple living and money and craziness. It hasn\u2019t been quite that lurid. As for the money part, and I know that you are the last person to want to hear about the money part: It is not a case of winner take all. Jill has paid for half of this country house in which I write, for example, and essentially supports herself. If something should happen to me, she would get only one-sixth of what I had. So would you. So would Edith. So would Mark. Jane would get twice as much\u2014one-third. Nobody needs protection from Jill, who has in fact come to love all of you a lot, including Adam. She is a loving person.\nAs for high living: The wedding will be a small and quiet one. We want no publicity whatsoever. Jill\u2019s parents will keep the good news pretty much a secret. Since this is Jill\u2019s first marriage, it should have a certain amount of glamour. The guest list is short, though\u2014about fifty people, mostly her family, and only our closest mutual friends. It will be as secular as I can make it, since I am not a Christian of any kind. But it will take place in a church, because churches are so beautiful\u2014and holy. Since the Unitarians believe in almost nothing, I am hoping for a Unitarian church. It will happen in New York City somewhere, probably around 4:30. The attendants will be little kids\u2014Jill\u2019s nieces and nephews, with her father giving her away, of course. It will be very private. We don\u2019t want our pictures in the paper. We will probably give a small party in a private room at some restaurant afterwards.\nAs for the groom\u2019s side: I hope my brother will come. I will do without a Best Man. I will be solo up there, without accomplices. I sympathize fully with the mixed loyalties you and all the rest of my children would feel on such an occasion. So I of course invite you all, and hope you all will come. If the ceremony and party are going to cause you pain, you should not subject yourself to that pain. Your coming or staying away will not be a vote for or against anything.\nMostly, dear Nanny, I want you to know how happy I am just now, and that I have every reason to look forward to some very good years ahead. We have all calmed down.\nAnd remain assured that I love you as much as anybody on this planet.\nYOUR FATHER\nSeptember 14, 1979\nNew York City\nTO GAIL GODWIN", 0.1678856191090234], "title": "Letters"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["bowl", 0.03773584905660377], ["note", 0.02830188679245283], ["center", 0.02830188679245283], ["looked", 0.02830188679245283], ["winds", 0.018867924528301886], ["thousands", 0.018867924528301886], ["boulder", 0.018867924528301886], ["people", 0.018867924528301886], ["clearing", 0.018867924528301886], ["bokonon", 0.018867924528301886], ["ice", 0.018867924528301886], ["mona", 0.018867924528301886], ["place", 0.018867924528301886], ["god", 0.018867924528301886], ["scattered", 0.009433962264150943], ["focus", 0.009433962264150943], ["kill", 0.009433962264150943], ["assembled", 0.009433962264150943], ["slow", 0.009433962264150943], ["survivors", 0.009433962264150943], ["lorenzo", 0.009433962264150943], ["ofboko", 0.009433962264150943], ["good", 0.009433962264150943], ["spurious", 0.009433962264150943], ["freezing", 0.009433962264150943], ["121", 0.009433962264150943], ["die", 0.009433962264150943], ["withdrawal", 0.009433962264150943], ["poisoned", 0.009433962264150943], ["round", 0.009433962264150943], ["dead", 0.009433962264150943], ["understood", 0.009433962264150943], ["lips", 0.009433962264150943], ["sea", 0.009433962264150943], ["concern", 0.009433962264150943], ["blue", 0.009433962264150943], ["delivered", 0.009433962264150943], ["stood", 0.009433962264150943], ["corpse", 0.009433962264150943], ["children", 0.009433962264150943], ["attitudes", 0.009433962264150943], ["finger", 0.009433962264150943], ["filled", 0.009433962264150943], ["told", 0.009433962264150943], ["melancholy", 0.009433962264150943], ["approached", 0.009433962264150943], ["men", 0.009433962264150943], ["death", 0.009433962264150943], ["surely", 0.009433962264150943], ["faced", 0.009433962264150943], ["frightful", 0.009433962264150943], ["gasped", 0.009433962264150943], ["cynic", 0.009433962264150943], ["named", 0.009433962264150943], ["gazed", 0.009433962264150943], ["mountebank", 0.009433962264150943], ["manners", 0.009433962264150943], ["brought", 0.009433962264150943], ["maru", 0.009433962264150943], ["almighty", 0.009433962264150943], ["white", 0.009433962264150943], ["eyes", 0.009433962264150943], ["holy", 0.009433962264150943], ["frost", 0.009433962264150943], ["frosted", 0.009433962264150943], ["orator", 0.009433962264150943], ["women", 0.009433962264150943], ["captive", 0.009433962264150943], ["avoiding", 0.009433962264150943], ["signed", 0.009433962264150943], ["corpses", 0.009433962264150943], ["san", 0.009433962264150943], ["amphitheater", 0.009433962264150943], ["commanded", 0.009433962264150943], ["tumbled", 0.009433962264150943], ["gingerly", 0.009433962264150943], ["morbid", 0.009433962264150943], ["answer", 0.009433962264150943], ["penciled", 0.009433962264150943], ["decedent", 0.009433962264150943], ["exactly", 0.009433962264150943], ["spectators", 0.009433962264150943], ["mouth", 0.009433962264150943], ["statuary", 0.009433962264150943], ["man", 0.009433962264150943], ["clear", 0.009433962264150943], ["person", 0.009433962264150943]], "sentiment": ["In that bowl were thousands upon thousands of dead. On the lips of each decedent was the blue-white frost of ice-nine.\nSince the corpses were not scattered or tumbled about, it was clear that they had been assembled since the withdrawal of the frightful winds. And, since each corpse had its finger in or near its mouth, I understood that each person had delivered himself to this melancholy place and then poisoned himself with ice-nine.\nThere were men, women, and children, too, many in the attitudes ofboko-maru. All faced the center of the bowl, as though they were spectators in an amphitheater.\nMona and I looked at the focus of all those frosted eyes, looked at the center of the bowl. There was a round clearing there, a place in which one orator might have stood.\nMona and I approached the clearing gingerly, avoiding the morbid statuary. We found a boulder in it. And under the boulder was a penciled note which said:\nTo whom it may concern: These people around you are almost all of the survivors on San Lorenzo of the winds that followed the freezing of the sea. These people made a captive of the spurious holy man named Bokonon. They brought him here, placed him at their center, and commanded him to tell them exactly what God Almighty was up to and what they should now do. The mountebank told them that God was surely trying to kill them, possibly because He was through with them, and that they should have the good manners to die. This, as you can see, they did.\nThe note was signed by Bokonon.\n121\nI AM SLOW TO ANSWER\n\u201cWHAT A CYNIC!\u201d I gasped.
