The floor plan and facades are almost exactly what they were eighty years ago. I\u2019ve had the plaster patched, and every surface has been given a new coat of paint.\nThe street-level floor is a three-room suite with a separate entrance. Jill rents that from me, and runs her business from there. I work on the top floor, where there is a guest room, too\u2014and a little kitchen. The middle two floors are where we live.\nThere is a Great Depression beginning. As it begins, I find myself possibly the luckiest of all businessmen. Delacorte owes me a lot of money, receivable in April, and the savings banks will go bankrupt before Delacorte does. Barring a revolution, we should be in very good shape for at least two years. I don\u2019t know many people who can say that. Since Africa turned out so brilliantly, I hope you will take many more dancing lessons from God. We are in a position to thrive on adversity. For instance: the death of the motorized tourist business could be a rebirth for Cape Cod.\nOur children have turned out brilliantly. We should be proud. Mark, Nanny, & Edith are delights. Tiger is coming here soon to talk about what he should do with his life during the gasoline shortage. Jim is in clover for, again, at least two more years. Steve worries me. I wish he were a touch more enterprising and worldly.\nI will not be a strikingly punctual and vivid gift-giver this Christmas. With the house and all that, I\u2019m running out of time.\nMuch love to you.
