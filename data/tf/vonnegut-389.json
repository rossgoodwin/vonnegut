He, too, seemed at peace. To him, the revolution had been a fascinating experiment, Paul realized. He had been less interested in achieving a premeditated end than in seeing what would happen with given beginnings.\nPaul took the bottle and studied Lasher for a moment over its fragrant mouth. Lasher, the chief instigator of it all, was contented. A lifelong trafficker in symbols, he had created the revolution as a symbol, and was now welcoming the opportunity to die as one.\nAnd that left Paul. \u201cTo a better world,\u201d he started to say, but he cut the toast short, thinking of the people of Ilium, already eager to recreate the same old nightmare. He shrugged. \u201cTo the record,\u201d he said, and smashed the empty bottle on a rock.\nVon Neumann considered Paul and then the broken glass. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing ever is, nothing ever will be\u2014not even Judgment Day.\u201d\n\u201cHands up,\u201d said Lasher almost gaily. \u201cForward March.\u201d\nPLAYER PIANO", 0.13223684210526315], "title": "Player Piano"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["allen", 0.04895104895104895], ["ginsberg", 0.02097902097902098], ["inducted", 0.013986013986013986], ["children", 0.013986013986013986], ["met", 0.013986013986013986], ["dinner", 0.013986013986013986], ["lampoon", 0.013986013986013986], ["1997", 0.013986013986013986], ["establishment", 0.013986013986013986], ["running", 0.013986013986013986], ["vance", 0.013986013986013986], ["replied", 0.006993006993006993], ["souls", 0.006993006993006993], ["rebellious", 0.006993006993006993], ["hugged", 0.006993006993006993], ["touch", 0.006993006993006993], ["love", 0.006993006993006993], ["newsweek", 0.006993006993006993], ["nominally", 0.006993006993006993], ["hold", 0.006993006993006993], ["22", 0.006993006993006993], ["late", 0.006993006993006993], ["starving", 0.006993006993006993], ["returned", 0.006993006993006993], ["read", 0.006993006993006993], ["admit", 0.006993006993006993], ["begging", 0.006993006993006993], ["dc", 0.006993006993006993], ["famous", 0.006993006993006993], ["congregation", 0.006993006993006993], ["yellow", 0.006993006993006993], ["hands", 0.006993006993006993], ["utmost", 0.006993006993006993], ["radiant", 0.006993006993006993], ["feast", 0.006993006993006993], ["anachronistic", 0.006993006993006993], ["satiates", 0.006993006993006993], ["starvation", 0.006993006993006993], ["side", 0.006993006993006993], ["hair", 0.006993006993006993], ["bourjaily", 0.006993006993006993], ["novelist", 0.006993006993006993], ["distended", 0.006993006993006993], ["knees", 0.006993006993006993], ["everted", 0.006993006993006993], ["entertainment", 0.006993006993006993], ["surrounded", 0.006993006993006993], ["frank", 0.006993006993006993], ["tribute", 0.006993006993006993], ["bellies", 0.006993006993006993], ["outsiders", 0.006993006993006993], ["told", 0.006993006993006993], ["reporter", 0.006993006993006993], ["industrialized", 0.006993006993006993], ["appetites", 0.006993006993006993], ["story", 0.006993006993006993], ["harvard", 0.006993006993006993], ["innocence", 0.006993006993006993], ["losing", 0.006993006993006993], ["november", 0.006993006993006993], ["institute", 0.006993006993006993], ["times", 0.006993006993006993], ["angeles", 0.006993006993006993], ["thing", 0.006993006993006993], ["asked", 0.006993006993006993], ["cambridge", 0.006993006993006993], ["letters", 0.006993006993006993], ["civil", 0.006993006993006993], ["directly", 0.006993006993006993], ["arts", 0.006993006993006993], ["blockaded", 0.006993006993006993], ["los", 0.006993006993006993], ["political", 0.006993006993006993], ["witnessing", 0.006993006993006993], ["poet", 0.006993006993006993], ["nigeria", 0.006993006993006993], ["war", 0.006993006993006993], ["toe", 0.006993006993006993], ["sort", 0.006993006993006993], ["head", 0.006993006993006993], ["holy", 0.006993006993006993], ["sores", 0.006993006993006993], ["telephoned", 0.006993006993006993], ["infection", 0.006993006993006993], ["goals", 0.006993006993006993], ["ashamed", 0.006993006993006993], ["midst", 0.006993006993006993], ["ibos", 0.006993006993006993], ["rectums", 0.006993006993006993], ["mercy", 0.006993006993006993], ["wise", 0.006993006993006993], ["guile", 0.006993006993006993], ["appearance", 0.006993006993006993], ["dirty", 0.006993006993006993], ["played", 0.006993006993006993], ["1973", 0.006993006993006993], ["modern", 0.006993006993006993], ["turned", 0.006993006993006993], ["deep", 0.006993006993006993], ["fellow", 0.006993006993006993], ["ensuing", 0.006993006993006993], ["catholic", 0.006993006993006993], ["afraid", 0.006993006993006993], ["1960", 0.006993006993006993], ["poetry", 0.006993006993006993], ["absorbed", 0.006993006993006993], ["vonnegut", 0.006993006993006993], ["widespread", 0.006993006993006993], ["relief", 0.006993006993006993], ["sir", 0.006993006993006993], ["southern", 0.006993006993006993], ["arrived", 0.006993006993006993], ["letter", 0.006993006993006993], ["squeamishness", 0.006993006993006993], ["man", 0.006993006993006993], ["surprising", 0.006993006993006993], ["blockade", 0.006993006993006993], ["june", 0.006993006993006993], ["thought", 0.006993006993006993], ["person", 0.006993006993006993], ["reputation", 0.006993006993006993], ["greatest", 0.006993006993006993], ["time", 0.006993006993006993], ["american", 0.006993006993006993], ["kurt", 0.006993006993006993], ["fact", 0.006993006993006993]], "sentiment": ["LETTER TO BE READ AT A LOS ANGELES TRIBUTE TO ALLEN GINSBERG ON JUNE 1, 1997\nAllen Ginsberg and I were inducted into the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1973. A reporter from Newsweek telephoned me at that time, and asked me what I thought about two such outsiders being absorbed by the establishment. I replied, \u201cIf we aren\u2019t the establishment, I don\u2019t know who is.\u201d\nAllen was inducted nominally as a poet, but had in fact become world famous for the radiant love and innocence of his person, from head to toe.\nLet us be frank, and admit that the greatest poetry satiates few deep appetites in modern times. But the appearance in our industrialized midst of a man without guile or political goals or congregation, who was doing his utmost to become wise and holy, was for many of us a surprising, anachronistic feast for our souls.\nAllen and I met at a dinner given in Cambridge by the Harvard Lampoon in the late 1960\u2019s. We would hold hands during the ensuing entertainment.\nI had returned from witnessing the end of a civil war in southern Nigeria. The losing side, the rebellious Ibos, had been blockaded. There had been widespread starvation. I was there with my fellow novelist Vance Bourjaily. We arrived on a blockade-running Catholic relief DC-3. We were surrounded at once by starving children begging for mercy. They had distended bellies, everted rectums, hair turned yellow, running sores, that sort of thing. They were also dirty.\nWe were afraid to touch them, lest we get an infection to take back home. But Vance was ashamed of his squeamishness. He said that if Allen Ginsberg had been with us, Allen would have hugged the children, and gone down on his knees and played with them.\nI told this story at the Lampoon dinner, and then said directly to Allen: \u201cWe have not met before, sir, but such is your reputation.\u201d\n\u2014Kurt Vonnegut\nNovember 22, 1997", 0.11497584541062804], "title": "Letters"}}
