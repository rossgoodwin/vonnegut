You write beautifully. I wish just one of my students had as much talent & charm & wisdom as you.\nOctober 7, 1965\nIowa City\nTO EDITH VONNEGUT\nKurt\u2019s daughter Edith would come to Iowa City and attend University High School, which she would soon \u201cfind a paradise.\u201d\nDearest Edith:\nMom tells me that you are planning to come out here and live with me around November 12. That is fine with me. I have plenty of room for you, and I could sure use some company.\nThere are two high schools in Iowa City, and everybody on the English faculty tells me that they are both first-rate. They have to be good, because all the parents in town are college professors. Kids in this town, incidentally, seem to have one hell of a good time, as you will soon see.\nThe school closest to me\u2014about six blocks from my house and two blocks from my office\u2014is the University High School. It isn\u2019t run by the city. It is run by the University\u2019s College of Education. They are supposed to have a long waiting list, but I talked to the principal today, and he said you would be most welcome. I had a look at the art department, and it\u2019s huge, and they\u2019re doing all kinds of marvelous stuff. Art is big in the city. The University has a very famous art school, which has studies all around my office. Tell Mom that the principal of your new school and several of the teachers have doctor\u2019s degrees. That shouldn\u2019t worry you. That just means that you\u2019ll get better teaching than you\u2019re used to.\nI had better warn you about a couple of things: I can be pretty boring company sometimes, and winters out here are unbelievably cold. But we\u2019ll have a nice time anyway. This is a crazy Victorian house, with funny, elaborate furniture. You\u2019ll have all the privacy you want. I\u2019ll give you the two front rooms, and close the huge doors that can separate them from the rest of the house. That way you\u2019ll have a bedroom and sitting room all your own, and a very flashy connecting bath we\u2019ll have to share. Our kitchen is also flashy. You\u2019ll be amazed by your sitting room. It has two nice couches, several easy chairs, a piano, and a chandelier. You\u2019ll have to share it, of course, when Mom and Nanny come.", 0.24174242424242431], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["trout", 0.01932367149758454], ["choppers",

The manual should point out that vehicles themselves are not responsible for the damage they cause, whether controlled or not. Punishing automobiles as though they were rebellious slaves in need of a hiding is a waste of time! Scapegoating cars and trucks and buses still in running condition, simply because they are automobiles, moreover, deprives rescue workers and refugees of their means of transportation.\nAs Trout advises in MTYOAP: \u201cBeating the daylights out of a stranger\u2019s parked Dodge Intrepid may well afford fleeting relief from symptoms of stress. When all is said and done, though, that can only leave the life of its owner even more of a crock of shit than it was before. Do unto others\u2019 vehicles as you would have them do unto yours.\n\u201cIt is pure superstition that a motor vehicle with its ignition turned off can start itself up without the help of a human being,\u201d he goes on. \u201cIf, after free will kicks in, you must yank the ignition keys out of driverless vehicles whose engines aren\u2019t running, please, please, please throw the keys into a mailbox, and not down a storm sewer or into a trash-strewn vacant lot.\u201d\nThe biggest mistake Trout himself made, probably, was in turning the American Academy of Arts and Letters into a morgue. The steel front door and its frame were tacked up back in place again, to keep the heat inside. It would have made more sense to line up the bodies outside, where the temperature was well below freezing.\nAnd Trout couldn\u2019t have been expected to worry about it, way-the-hell-and-gone up there on West 155th, but some awakened member of the Federal Aviation Administration should have realized, after all the crashing at ground level petered out, that there were still planes aloft on automatic pilot. Their crews and passengers, still gaga with untreated PTA, couldn\u2019t care doodley what would happen when the fuel ran out.\nIn ten minutes, or maybe an hour, or maybe three hours or whatever, their heavier-than-air-craft, often six miles up, would cash in the chips, would buy the farm, for all aboard.\nFor the Mbuti, the rain forest Pygmies of Zaire, Africa, February 13th, 2001, was in all probability a day neither more nor less amazing than any other day, unless a rogue airplane happened to land on top of one of them after the rerun stopped.\nThe worst of all aircraft when free will kicks in, of course, are helicopters, or choppers, air screws first envisioned by the genius Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519). Choppers can\u2019t glide. Choppers don\u2019t want to fly in the first place.", 0.12855542754736302], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["kelly", 0.044642857142857144], ["ying",

Pi Ying said that their fight against death would be no different, philosophically, from what all of them, except Kelly\u2019s wife and children, had known in battle. In a cold way, it was true\u2014no different, philosophically. But Colonel Kelly was more shaken than he had ever been in battle.\nColonel Kelly and the fifteen on the other side of the door had crash-landed two days before on the Asiatic mainland, after they had been blown off course by a sudden storm and their radio had gone dead. Colonel Kelly had been on his way, with his family, to a post as military attach\u00e9 in India. On board the Army transport plane with them had been a group of enlisted men, technical specialists needed in the Middle East. The plane had come to earth in territory held by a Communist guerrilla chief, Pi Ying.\nAll had survived the crash\u2014Kelly, his wife Margaret, his ten-year-old twin sons, the pilot and copilot, and the ten enlisted men. A dozen of Pi Ying\u2019s ragged riflemen had been waiting for them when they climbed from the plane. Unable to communicate with their captors, the Americans had been marched for a day through rice fields and near-jungle to come at sunset to a decaying palace. There they had been locked in a subterranean room, with no idea of what their fates might be.\nNow, Colonel Kelly was returning from an interview with Pi Ying, who had told him what was to become of the sixteen American prisoners. Sixteen\u2014Kelly shook his head as the number repeated itself in his thoughts.\nThe guard prodded him to one side with his pistol and thrust the key into the lock, and the door swung open. Kelly stood silently in the doorway.\nA cigarette was being passed from hand to hand. It cast its glow for an instant on each expectant face in turn. Now it lighted the ruddy face of the talkative young corporal from Minneapolis, now cast rugged shadows over the eye sockets and heavy brows of the pilot from Salt Lake, now bloomed red at the thin lips of the sergeant.\nKelly looked from the men to what seemed in the twilight to be a small hillock by the door. There his wife Margaret sat, with the blond heads of her sleeping sons cradled in her lap. She smiled up at him, her face misty white. \"Darling\u2014you\u2019re all right?\" Margaret asked quietly.\n\"Yes, I\u2019m all right.\"\n\"Sarge,\" said the corporal, \"ask him what Pi Ying said.\"", -0.017103174603174603], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["felix", 0.0625], ["genevieve", 0.0625], ["wonder", 0.05], ["idiot", 0.0375], ["play", 0.0375], ["savant", 0.0375], ["thought", 0.0375], ["pharmacy", 0.025], ["piano", 0.025], ["vocabulary", 0.025], ["brother", 0.025], ["wrote", 0.025], ["shop", 0.0125], ["cord", 0.0125], ["walking", 0.0125], ["mind", 0.0125], ["coffee", 0.0125], ["son", 0.0125], ["produced", 0.0125], ["born", 0.0125], ["street", 0.0125], ["baths", 0.0125], ["gossip", 0.0125], ["funny", 0.0125], ["afraid", 0.0125], ["cooper", 0.0125], ["degree", 0.0125], ["defective", 0.0125], ["gary", 0.0125], ["sunday", 0.0125], ["going", 0.0125], ["details", 0.0125], ["waited", 0.0125], ["sat", 0.0125], ["poor", 0.0125], ["murder", 0.0125], ["murderer", 0.0125], ["big", 0.0125], ["umbilical", 0.0125], ["wasn", 0.0125], ["extraordinary", 0.0125], ["reason", 0.0125], ["christopher", 0.0125], ["invisible", 0.0125], ["theater", 0.0125], ["strangled", 0.0125], ["friends", 0.0125], ["bigger", 0.0125], ["handsome", 0.0125], ["wise", 0.0125], ["couldn", 0.0125], ["shy", 0.0125], ["counter", 0.0125], ["stupid", 0.0125], ["talk", 0.0125], ["playing", 0.0125]], "sentiment": ["GENEVIEVE: Never mind the gossip.

But, coming upon that face suddenly in a home-town alley, Billy could not guess why the face was familiar. Billy thought maybe he had known this cracked messiah in Dresden somewhere. Trout certainly looked like a prisoner of war.\nAnd then the newspaper girl held up her hand. \u201cMr. Trout\u2014\u201d she said, \u201cif I win, can I take my sister, too?\u201d\n\u201cHell no,\u201d said Kilgore Trout. \u201cYou think money grows on trees?\u201d\nTrout, incidentally, had written a book about a money tree.

It attracted human beings who killed each other around the roots and made very good fertilizer.\nSo it goes.\nBilly Pilgrim parked his Cadillac in the alley, and waited for the meeting to end. When the meeting broke up, there was still one boy Trout had to deal with. The boy wanted to quit because the work was so hard and the hours were so long and the pay was so small. Trout was concerned, because, if the boy really quit, Trout would have to deliver the boy\u2019s route himself, until he could find another sucker.\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Trout asked the boy scornfully. \u201cSome kind of gutless wonder?\u201d\nThis, too, was the title of a book by Trout, The Gutless Wonder.

When the ball came to a stop of its own accord, the fielders went after it with a sort of ritual clumsiness. Clearly, the point of their efforts was not to hit Chrono with the ball, was not to put him out. The fielders were all conspiring to increase the glory of Chrono by making a show of helpless opposition.\nClearly, Chrono was the most glorious thing that the children had ever seen on Mars, and any glory they themselves had came from their association with him. They would do anything to make his glory grow.\nYoung Chrono slid into home in a cloud of rust.\nA fielder hurled the ball at him\u2014too late, too late, much too late. The fielder ritually cursed his luck.\nYoung Chrono stood, dusted himself off, and again kissed his good-luck piece, thanked it for another home run. He believed firmly that all his powers came from the good-luck piece, and so did his schoolmates, and so, secretly, did Miss Fenstermaker.\nThe history of the good-luck piece was this:\nOne day the school children were taken by Miss Fenstermaker on an educational tour of a flame-thrower factory. The factory manager explained to the children all the steps in the manufacture of flame-throwers, and hoped that some of the children, when they grew up, would want to come to work for him. At the end of the tour, in the packaging department, the manager\u2019s ankle became snarled in a spiral of steel strapping, a type of strapping that was used for binding shut the packaged flame-throwers.\nThe spiral was a piece of jagged-ended scrap that had been cast into the factory aisle by a careless workman. The manager scratched his ankle and tore his pants before he got free of the spiral. He thereupon put on the first really comprehensible demonstration that the children had seen that day.

haven\u2019t played this game since my Army days, and never played it very well. But you should see Mrs. Berman clear the table of balls no matter where they are!\n\u201cWhere did you ever learn to shoot pool like that?\u201d I asked her.\nShe said that after her father committed suicide she dropped out of high school and, rather than be sexually promiscuous or become an alcoholic in Lackawanna, she spent ten hours a day shooting pool instead.\nI don\u2019t have to play with her. Nobody has to play with her, and I don\u2019t suppose anybody had to play with her in Lackawanna. But a funny thing will happen. She will suddenly lose her deadly accuracy, and have a fit of yawns and will scratch herself as though she had a fit of itching, too. Then she will go up to bed, and sometimes sleep until noon the next day.\nShe is the moodiest woman I ever knew.\nAnd what of the broad hints I have given as to the secret of the potato barn? Won\u2019t she read them in this manuscript, and easily guess the rest? No.\nShe keeps her promises, and she promised me when I began to write that, once I reached one hundred and fifty pages, if I ever reached one hundred and fifty pages, she would reward me with perfect privacy in this writing room.\nShe said further that when I got this far, if I got that far, this book and I would have become so intimate that it would be indecent for her to intrude. And that is nice, I guess, to have earned through hard work certain privileges and marks of respect, except that I have to ask myself: \u201cWho is she to reward or punish me, and what the hell is this: a nursery school or a prison camp?\u201d I don\u2019t ask her that, because then she might take away all my privileges.\nTwo dandified young German businessmen from Frankfurt came to see my wonderful collection yesterday afternoon. They were typical successful post-Nazi entrepreneurs, to whom history was a clean slate. They were so new, new, new. Like Dan Gregory, they spoke English with upper-class British accents, but asked early on if Circe and I understood any German. They wanted to know, it became evident, whether or not they could communicate frankly to each other in that language without being understood.

It was noon. He was still asleep. He had had one hell of a night, not only with telephone calls, but with people coming in person at all hours, more than half of them drunk. There was panic in Rosewater. No matter how often Eliot had denied it, his clients were sure he was leaving them forever.\nEliot had cleared off the top of his desk. Laid out on it were a new blue suit, a new white shirt, a new blue tie, a new pair of black nylon socks, a new pair of Jockey shorts, a new toothbrush and a bottle of Lavoris. He had used the new toothbrush once. His mouth was a bloody wreck.\nDogs barked outside. They crossed the street from the firehouse to greet a great favorite of theirs, Delbert Peach, a town drunk. They were cheering him in his efforts to stop being a human being and become a dog. \"Git! Git! Git!\" he cried ineffectually. \"God damn, I ain't in heat.\"\nHe tumbled in through Eliot's street-level door, slammed the door on his best friends, climbed the stairs singing. This is what he sang:\nI've got the clap, and the blueballs, too. The clap don't hurt, but the blueballs do.\nDelbert Peach, all bristles and stink, ran out of that song halfway up the stairs, for his progress was slow. He switched to The Star Spangled Banner, and he was gasping and burping and humming that when he entered Eliot's office proper.\n\"Mr. Rosewater? Mr. Rosewater?\" Eliot's head was under his blanket, and his hands, though he was sound asleep, gripped the shroud tightly. So Peach, in order to see Eliot's beloved face, had to overcome the strength of those hands. \"Mr. Rosewater\u2014are you alive?

Not much, but some.\u201d\n\u201cMoney,\u201d she said, and she laughed. Her scornful laughter about money had not changed.

She was growing strong again. It was Mary Kathleen who now separated herself from me, and not the other way around. She became raucous again. I picked up three of her bags, and she picked up the other three. Our ultimate destination, it would turn out, was the very top of the Chrysler Building, the quiet showroom of The American Harp Company up there. But first we had to get the crowd to part for us, and she began to call people in our way \u201ccapitalist fats\u201d and \u201cbloated plutocrats\u201d and \u201cbloodsuckers\u201d and all that again.\nHer means of locomotion in her gargantuan basketball shoes was this: She barely lifted the shoes from the ground, shoving one forward and then the other, like cross-country skis, while her upper body and shopping bags swiveled wildly from side to side. But that oscillating old woman could go like the wind! I panted to keep up with her, once we got clear of the crowd. We were surely the cynosure of all eyes. Nobody had ever seen a shopping-bag lady with an assistant before.\nWhen we got to Grand Central Station, Mary Kathleen said that we had to make sure we weren\u2019t being followed. She led me up and down escalators, ramps, and stairways, looking over her shoulders for pursuers all the time. We scampered through the Oyster Bar three times. She brought us at last to an iron door at the end of a dimly lit corridor. We surely were all alone. Our hearts were beating hard.\nWhen we had recovered our breaths, she said to me, \u201cI am going to show you something you mustn\u2019t tell anybody about.\u201d", 0.12576164874551973], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["angela", 0.05952380952380952], ["frank", 0.047619047619047616], ["picture", 0.03571428571428571], ["newt", 0.03571428571428571], ["girl", 0.023809523809523808], ["accordion", 0.023809523809523808], ["father", 0.023809523809523808], ["dr", 0.023809523809523808], ["going", 0.023809523809523808], ["book", 0.023809523809523808], ["sort", 0.011904761904761904], ["engagement", 0.011904761904761904], ["san", 0.011904761904761904], ["fair", 0.011904761904761904], ["girls", 0.011904761904761904], ["reunion", 0.011904761904761904], ["purse", 0.011904761904761904], ["idea", 0.011904761904761904], ["honey", 0.011904761904761904], ["accepting", 0.011904761904761904], ["promised", 0.011904761904761904], ["wasn", 0.011904761904761904], ["flipped", 0.011904761904761904], ["best", 0.011904761904761904], ["family", 0.011904761904761904], ["breed", 0.011904761904761904], ["plastic", 0.011904761904761904], ["better", 0.011904761904761904], ["paint", 0.011904761904761904], ["contained", 0.011904761904761904], ["interested", 0.011904761904761904], ["lorenzo", 0.011904761904761904], ["billfold", 0.011904761904761904], ["saint", 0.011904761904761904], ["party", 0.011904761904761904], ["beach", 0.011904761904761904], ["hoenikker", 0.011904761904761904], ["told", 0.011904761904761904], ["placated", 0.011904761904761904], ["felix", 0.011904761904761904], ["string", 0.011904761904761904], ["lucky", 0.011904761904761904], ["homely", 0.011904761904761904], ["bound", 0.011904761904761904], ["nobel", 0.011904761904761904], ["plane", 0.011904761904761904], ["glimpses", 0.011904761904761904], ["letter", 0.011904761904761904], ["telling", 0.011904761904761904], ["cape", 0.011904761904761904], ["prize", 0.011904761904761904], ["photograph", 0.011904761904761904], ["cod", 0.011904761904761904], ["longer", 0.011904761904761904], ["photographs", 0.011904761904761904], ["clear", 0.011904761904761904], ["married", 0.011904761904761904], ["twin", 0.011904761904761904], ["asked", 0.011904761904761904], ["marry", 0.011904761904761904], ["weren", 0.011904761904761904], ["pleats", 0.011904761904761904], ["supposed", 0.011904761904761904], ["scolded", 0.011904761904761904], ["model", 0.011904761904761904], ["operate", 0.011904761904761904], ["flying", 0.011904761904761904]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHoney, you should have showed me that letter,\u201d she scolded.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Newt. \u201cI didn\u2019t think.\u201d\n\u201cI might as well tell you,\u201d Angela said to me, \u201cDr. Breed told me I wasn\u2019t supposed to co-operate with you.
