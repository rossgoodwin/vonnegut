He was decorated with a Purple Heart and a Silver Star and a Bronze Star with two clusters.\nThis was a boy who had flunked out of high school, who had been an alcoholic at sixteen, who had run with a rotten bunch of kids, who had been arrested for tipping over hundreds of tombstones in a Catholic cemetery one time.

The listlessness concealed a mind which was fizzing and flashing thrillingly. It was preparing letters and lectures about the flying saucers, the negligibility of death, and the true nature of time.\nProfessor Rumfoord said frightful things about Billy within Billy\u2019s

He had volunteered for the Army of Mars, and already wore the dashing uniform of a lieutenant-colonel in the Assault Infantry of that service. He felt elegant, indeed, having been rather underprivileged spiritually on Earth, and assumed, as spiritually underprivileged persons will, that the uniform said lovely things about him.\n\"His memory hadn\u2019t been cleaned out yet, and his antenna had yet to be installed\u2014but he was so patently a loyal Martian that he was given the run of the space ship. The recruiters have a saying about a male recruit like that\u2014that he has named his balls Deimos and Phobus,\" said Rumfoord, \"Deimos and Phobus being the two moons of Mars.\n\"This lieutenant-colonel, with no military training whatsoever, was having the experience known on Earth as finding himself. Ignorant as he was of the enterprise in which he was ensnarled, he was issuing orders to the other recruits, and having them obeyed.\"\nRumfoord held up a finger, and Unk was startled to see that it was quite translucent. \"There was one locked stateroom that the man was not permitted to enter,\" said Rumfoord. \"The crew carefully explained to him that the stateroom contained the most beautiful woman ever taken to Mars, and that any man who saw her was certain to fall in love with her. Love, they said, would destroy the value of any but the most professional soldier.\n\"The new lieutenant-colonel was offended by the suggestion that he was not a professional soldier, and he regaled the crew with stories of his amatory exploits with gorgeous women\u2014all of which had left his heart absolutely untouched. The crew remained skeptical, pretending to the opinion that the lieutenant-colonel had never, for all his lascivious questing, exposed himself to an intelligent, haughty beauty such as the one in the locked stateroom.\n\"The crew\u2019s seeming respect for the lieutenant-colonel was now subtly withdrawn. The other recruits sensed this withdrawal, and withdrew their own. The lieutenant-colonel in his gaudy uniform was made to feel like what he really was, after all\u2014a strutting clown. The manner in which he could win back his dignity was never stated, but was obvious to one and all. He could win it back by making a conquest of the beauty locked in the stateroom. He was fully prepared to do this\u2014was desperately prepared\u2014\n\"But the crew,\" said Rumfoord, \"continued to protect him from supposed amatory failure and a broken heart. His ego fizzed, it sizzled, it snapped, it crackled, it popped.\n\"There was a drinking party in the officers\u2019 mess,\" said Rumfoord, \"and the lieutenant-colonel became quite drunk and loud. He bragged again of his heartless lewdnesses on Earth. And then he saw that someone had placed in the bottom of his glass a stateroom key.\n\"The lieutenant-colonel sneaked away to the locked stateroom forthwith, let himself in, and closed the door behind him,\" said Rumfoord. \"The stateroom was dark, but the inside of the lieutenant-colonel\u2019s head was illuminated by liquor and by the triumphant words of the announcement he would make at breakfast the next morning.\n\"He took the woman in the dark easily, for she was weak with terror and sedatives,\" said Rumfoord. \"It was a joyless union, satisfactory to no one but Mother Nature at her most callous.", 0.10426109837874543], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["akiko", 0.03125], ["captain", 0.03125], ["willard", 0.03125], ["mary", 0.03125], ["flemming", 0.03125], ["love", 0.025], ["man", 0.025], ["stories", 0.01875], ["person", 0.01875], ["young", 0.0125], ["school", 0.0125], ["roy", 0.0125], ["marry", 0.0125], ["god", 0.0125], ["mandarax", 0.0125], ["marriage", 0.0125], ["minutes", 0.0125], ["kaplan", 0.0125], ["wife", 0.0125], ["affair", 0.00625], ["proposed", 0.00625], ["mattered", 0.00625], ["hugging", 0.00625], ["years", 0.00625], ["brain", 0.00625], ["enjoyed", 0.00625], ["oaths", 0.00625], ["furry", 0.00625], ["father", 0.00625], ["intensive", 0.00625], ["eager", 0.00625], ["going", 0.00625], ["parents", 0.00625], ["beloved", 0.00625], ["smile", 0.00625], ["save", 0.00625], ["meant", 0.00625], ["good", 0.00625], ["wojciehowitz", 0.00625], ["closed", 0.00625], ["fate", 0.00625], ["big", 0.00625], ["samuel", 0.00625], ["dearly", 0.00625], ["lady", 0.00625], ["married", 0.00625], ["grandfather", 0.00625], ["quick", 0.00625], ["husband", 0.00625], ["luck", 0.00625], ["people", 0.00625], ["alive", 0.00625], ["second", 0.00625], ["sight", 0.00625], ["luckiest", 0.00625], ["pronounced", 0.00625], ["robert", 0.00625], ["seriously", 0.00625], ["international", 0.00625], ["told", 0.00625], ["gathered", 0.00625], ["men", 0.00625], ["hepburn", 0.00625], ["santa", 0.00625], ["news", 0.00625], ["hundreds", 0.00625], ["care", 0.00625], ["sending", 0.00625], ["mainland", 0.00625], ["couldn", 0.00625], ["island", 0.00625], ["named", 0.00625], ["colony", 0.00625], ["logical", 0.00625], ["hearing", 0.00625], ["shipyard", 0.00625], ["widower", 0.00625], ["laugh", 0.00625], ["apologize", 0.00625], ["baltra", 0.00625], ["engagement", 0.00625], ["wonderful", 0.00625], ["call", 0.00625], ["butler", 0.00625], ["legally", 0.00625], ["wait", 0.00625], ["life", 0.00625], ["ridiculous", 0.00625], ["hear", 0.00625], ["quotation", 0.00625], ["ilium", 0.00625], ["toothless", 0.00625], ["trick", 0.00625], ["matter", 0.00625], ["malm", 0.00625], ["kissing", 0.00625], ["bent", 0.00625], ["played", 0.00625], ["engaged", 0.00625], ["head", 0.00625], ["high", 0.00625], ["decapitation", 0.00625], ["ship", 0.00625], ["memorize", 0.00625], ["began", 0.00625], ["1612", 0.00625], ["department", 0.00625], ["entitled", 0.00625], ["quoth", 0.00625], ["waters", 0.00625], ["english", 0.00625], ["plenty", 0.00625], ["died", 0.00625], ["rosalia", 0.00625], ["face", 0.00625], ["thought", 0.00625], ["1680", 0.00625], ["time", 0.00625], ["serious", 0.00625], ["wind", 0.00625]], "sentiment": ["Not that it mattered much what she was engaged to, her big brain told her, since they certainly couldn\u2019t get married before they got to Baltra, and \u201cWillard Flemming,\u201d if he was still alive, would have to go into intensive care immediately.

So that Mary would apologize to her for having so few first-person love stories to tell. Her parents had certainly been very much in love, she said, and Akiko enjoyed hearing about how they were still kissing and hugging each other right up to the end.\nMary could make Akiko laugh about the ridiculous love affair, if you could call it that, she had had with a widower named Robert Wojciehowitz, who was head of the English Department at Ilium High School before the school closed down.

Africa and Sicily and England and France. I was forced to fight at last on the border of Germany, and was wounded and captured without having fired a shot. There was this white flash.\nThe war in Europe ended on May 8, 1945. My prison camp had not yet been captured by the Russians. I, with hundreds of other captured officers from Great Britain, from France, from Belgium, from Yugoslavia, from Russia, from Italy, which country had switched sides, from Canada and New Zealand and South Africa and Australia, from everywhere, was marched at route step out of our prison and into the still-to-be-conquered countryside. Our guards vanished one night, and we awoke the next morning on the rim of a great green valley on what is now the border between East Germany and Czechoslovakia. There may have been as many as ten thousand people below us\u2014concentration camp survivors, slave laborers, lunatics released from asylums and ordinary criminals released from jails and prisons, captured officers and enlisted men from every Army which had fought the Germans.\nWhat a sight! And, if that weren\u2019t enough for a person to see and then marvel about for a lifetime, listen to this: the very last remains of Hitler\u2019s armies, their uniforms in tatters but their killing machines still in working order, were also there.\nUnforgettable!\n26\nAT THE END of my war, my country, where the only person I knew was a Chinese laundryman, paid in full for cosmetic surgery performed on the place where my eye used to be. Was I bitter? No, I was simply blank, which I came to realize was what Fred Jones used to be. Neither one of us had anything to come home to.\nWho paid for my eye operation at Fort Benjamin Harrison outside Indianapolis? He was a tall, skinny fellow, tough but fair-minded, plain spoken but shrewd. No, I am not speaking of Santa Claus, whose image in shopping malls at Christmas time nowadays is largely based on a painting Dan Gregory made for Liberty magazine in 1923.

Marquis was a bachelor then, and she married him.\nLate in the 1930s Uncle Walter had trouble getting parts because of his drinking, and he came home to Indiana with a new wife, a pretty young actress named Rosalie, who was never really accepted by the family. They built a little house in an orchard in northern Indiana, which Uncle Walter\u2019s widowed mother owned. They lived there and drank a lot, and talked about starting a little repertory company there in the wilderness, as boozed-up former actors and actresses will do.\nThey died pretty soon.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJane Cox Vonnegut and I, childhood sweethearts in Indianapolis, separated in 1970 after a marriage which by conventional measurement was said to have lasted twenty-five years. We are still good friends, as they say. Like so many couples who are no longer couples these days, we have been through some terrible, unavoidable accident that we are ill-equipped to understand. Like our six children, we only just arrived on this planet and we were doing the best we could. We never saw what hit us. It wasn\u2019t another woman, it wasn\u2019t another man.\nWe woke up in ambulances headed for different hospitals, so to speak, and would never get together again. We were alive, yes, but the marriage was dead.\nAnd it was no Lazarus.\nIt was a good marriage for a long time\u2014and then it wasn\u2019t. The shock of having our children no longer need us happened somewhere in there. We were both going to have to find other sorts of seemingly important work to do and other compelling reasons for working and worrying so. But I am beginning to explain, which is a violation of a rule I lay down whenever I teach a class in writing: \u201cAll you can do is tell what happened. You will get thrown out of this course if you are arrogant enough to imagine that you can tell me why it happened. You do not know. You cannot know.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo I am embarrassed about the failure of my first marriage. I am embarrassed by my older relatives\u2019 responses to my books. But I was embarrassed before I was married or had written a book. A bad dream I have dreamed for as long as I can remember may hold a clue.

His new clothes hampered him, bound him in the crotch and armpits, crackled as though lined with newspaper, reminded him of how nicely turned out he was.\nThere was talk coming from the lunchroom. Eliot listened without showing himself. He did not recognize any of the voices, although they belonged to friends of his. Three men were talking ruefully of money, which they did not have. There were many pauses, for thoughts came to them almost as hard as money did.\n\"Well,\" said one at last, \"it ain't no disgrace to be poor.\" This line was the first half of a fine old joke by the Hoosier humorist, Kin Hubbard.\n\"No,\" said another man, completing the joke, \"but it might as well be.\"\nEliot crossed the street, went into Fire Chief Charley Warmergran's insurance office. Charley was not a pitiful person, had never applied to the Foundation for help of any kind. He was one of about seven in the county who had actually done quite well under real free enterprise. Bella of Bella's Beauty Nook was another. Both of them had started with nothing, both were children of brakemen on the Nickel Plate. Charley was ten years younger than Eliot. He was six-feet-four, had broad shoulders, no hips, no belly. In addition to being Fire Chief, he was Federal Marshal and Inspector of Weights and Measures. He also owned, jointly with Bella, La Boutique de Paris, which was a nice little haberdashery and notions store in the new shopping center for the well-to-do people in New Ambrosia. Like all real heroes, Charley had a fatal flaw. He refused to believe that he had gonorrhea, whereas the truth was that he did.\nCharley's famous secretary was on an errand. The only other person there when Eliot walked in was Noyes Finnerty, who was sweeping the floor. Noyes had been the center of the immortal Noah Rosewater Memorial High School Basketball Team which went undefeated in 1933. In 1934, Noyes strangled his sixteen-year-old wife for notorious infidelity, went to prison for life. Now he was paroled, thanks to Eliot. He was fifty-one. He had no friends, no relatives. Eliot found out about his being in prison by accident, while leafing through old copies of The Rosewater County Clarion Call, made it his business to get him paroled.\nNoyes was a quiet, cynical, resentful man. He had never thanked Eliot for anything. Eliot was neither hurt nor startled. He was used to ingratitude. One of his favorite Kilgore Trout books dealt with ingratitude and nothing else. It was called, The First District Court of Thankyou, which was a court you could take people to, if you felt they hadn't been properly grateful for something you had done. If the defendant lost his case, the court gave him a choice between thanking the plaintiff in public, or going into solitary confinement on bread and water for a month. According to Trout, eighty per cent of those convicted chose the black hole.\nNoyes was a lot faster than Charley in perceiving that Eliot was far from well. He stopped sweeping, watched acutely. He was a mean voyeur. Charley, enchanted by memories of so many fires at which he and Eliot had behaved so well, did not become suspicious until Eliot congratulated him on having just won an award which he had in fact won three years before.\n\"Eliot\u2014are you kidding?\"", 0.11126803751803753], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["kathleen", 0.027972027972027972], ["whistler", 0.027972027972027972], ["mary", 0.027972027972027972], ["company", 0.02097902097902098], ["shoes", 0.013986013986013986], ["fired", 0.013986013986013986], ["union", 0.013986013986013986], ["laughed", 0.013986013986013986], ["potters", 0.013986013986013986], ["cincinnati", 0.006993006993006993], ["yellow", 0.006993006993006993], ["month", 0.006993006993006993], ["symbols", 0.006993006993006993], ["held", 0.006993006993006993], ["letters", 0.006993006993006993], ["row", 0.006993006993006993], ["police", 0.006993006993006993], ["young", 0.006993006993006993], ["makers", 0.006993006993006993], ["johannsen", 0.006993006993006993], ["wearing", 0.006993006993006993], ["good", 0.006993006993006993], ["beat", 0.006993006993006993], ["big", 0.006993006993006993], ["plaster", 0.006993006993006993], ["goons", 0.006993006993006993], ["grandfathers", 0.006993006993006993], ["bandage", 0.006993006993006993], ["fall", 0.006993006993006993], ["shaping", 0.006993006993006993], ["scandinavia", 0.006993006993006993], ["skills", 0.006993006993006993], ["chairs", 0.006993006993006993], ["night", 0.006993006993006993], ["soft", 0.006993006993006993], ["national", 0.006993006993006993], ["treacherous", 0.006993006993006993], ["seam", 0.006993006993006993], ["year", 0.006993006993006993], ["arm", 0.006993006993006993], ["contributed", 0.006993006993006993], ["grinding", 0.006993006993006993], ["unions", 0.006993006993006993], ["routine", 0.006993006993006993], ["temple", 0.006993006993006993], ["told", 0.006993006993006993], ["kilns", 0.006993006993006993], ["supporting", 0.006993006993006993], ["funeral", 0.006993006993006993], ["men", 0.006993006993006993], ["abandon", 0.006993006993006993], ["harvard", 0.006993006993006993], ["surely", 0.006993006993006993], ["members", 0.006993006993006993], ["wanted", 0.006993006993006993], ["seventy", 0.006993006993006993], ["shine", 0.006993006993006993], ["essentially", 0.006993006993006993], ["accident", 0.006993006993006993], ["folding", 0.006993006993006993], ["country", 0.006993006993006993], ["citizens", 0.006993006993006993], ["place", 0.006993006993006993], ["wheels", 0.006993006993006993], ["fallen", 0.006993006993006993], ["organizers", 0.006993006993006993], ["appropriately", 0.006993006993006993], ["cambridge", 0.006993006993006993], ["love", 0.006993006993006993], ["family", 0.006993006993006993], ["bandages", 0.006993006993006993], ["brought", 0.006993006993006993], ["guard", 0.006993006993006993], ["sober", 0.006993006993006993], ["respect", 0.006993006993006993], ["pillars", 0.006993006993006993], ["silent", 0.006993006993006993], ["working", 0.006993006993006993], ["area", 0.006993006993006993], ["decent", 0.006993006993006993], ["low", 0.006993006993006993], ["suit", 0.006993006993006993], ["store", 0.006993006993006993], ["happy", 0.006993006993006993], ["mining", 0.006993006993006993], ["turned", 0.006993006993006993], ["specialty", 0.006993006993006993], ["spirit", 0.006993006993006993], ["robber", 0.006993006993006993], ["loved", 0.006993006993006993], ["tunnel", 0.006993006993006993], ["cast", 0.006993006993006993], ["supposed", 0.006993006993006993], ["learn", 0.006993006993006993], ["fun", 0.006993006993006993], ["making", 0.006993006993006993], ["specialized", 0.006993006993006993], ["firing", 0.006993006993006993], ["kenneth", 0.006993006993006993], ["exhausted", 0.006993006993006993], ["mind", 0.006993006993006993], ["shined", 0.006993006993006993], ["buckeye", 0.006993006993006993], ["rally", 0.006993006993006993], ["grinder", 0.006993006993006993], ["necktie", 0.006993006993006993], ["coal", 0.006993006993006993], ["began", 0.006993006993006993], ["graduate", 0.006993006993006993], ["write", 0.006993006993006993], ["speech", 0.006993006993006993], ["forces", 0.006993006993006993], ["injured", 0.006993006993006993], ["knew", 0.006993006993006993], ["evil", 0.006993006993006993], ["hand", 0.006993006993006993], ["businessman", 0.006993006993006993], ["class", 0.006993006993006993], ["man", 0.006993006993006993], ["fathers", 0.006993006993006993], ["vacant", 0.006993006993006993], ["dog", 0.006993006993006993], ["academic", 0.006993006993006993], ["materials", 0.006993006993006993], ["time", 0.006993006993006993], ["occasion", 0.006993006993006993], ["joining", 0.006993006993006993]], "sentiment": ["What a treacherous young man I was!

To make sure of this, they performed an experiment. They put the idea into Earthlings\u2019 heads that the whole Universe had been created by one big male animal who looked just like them. He sat on a throne with a lot of less fancy thrones all around him. When people died they got to sit on those other thrones forever because they were such close relatives of the Creator.\nThe people down here just ate that up!\nANOTHER THING THE Elders liked about Earthlings was that they feared and hated other Earthlings who did not look and talk exactly as they did. They made life a hell for each other as well as for what they called \u201clower animals.\u201d They actually thought of strangers as lower animals. So all the Elders had to do to ensure that germs were going to experience really hard times was to tell us how to make more effective weapons by studying Physics and Chemistry. The Elders lost no time in doing this.\nTHEY CAUSED AN apple to fall on the head of Isaac Newton.\nThey made young James Watt prick up his ears when his mother\u2019s teakettle sang.\nTHE ELDERS MADE us think that the Creator on the big throne hated strangers as much as we did, and that we would be doing Him a big favor if we tried to exterminate them by any and all means possible.\nThat went over big down here.\nSO IT WASN\u2019T long before we had made the deadliest poisons in the Universe, and were stinking up the air and water and topsoil. In the words of the author, and I wish I knew his name, \u201cGerms died by the trillions or failed to reproduce because they could no longer cut the mustard.\u201d\nBut a few survived and even flourished, even though almost all other life forms on Earth perished.

Exit 10A. Drivers and passengers got out of their cars\u2014to stretch their legs and find out, if they could, what the trouble was up ahead.\nKilgore Trout was among those who got out. He learned from others that the new Holiday Inn was within easy walking distance. So he gathered up his parcels from the front seat of the Galaxie. He thanked the driver, whose name he had forgotten, and he began to trudge.\nHe also began to assemble in his mind a system of beliefs which would be appropriate to his narrow mission in Midland City, which was to show provincials, who were bent on exalting creativity, a would-be creator who had failed and failed. He paused in his trudge to examine himself in the rearview mirror, the rearview leak, of a truck locked up in traffic. The tractor was pulling two trailers instead of one. Here was the message the owners of the rig saw fit to shriek at human beings wherever it went:\nTrout\u2019s image in the leak was as shocking as he had hoped it would be. He had not washed up after his drubbing by The Pluto Gang, so there was caked blood on one earlobe, and more under his left nostril. There was dog shit on a shoulder of his coat. He had collapsed into dog shit on the handball court under the Queensboro Bridge after the robbery.\nBy an unbelievable coincidence, that shit came from the wretched greyhound belonging to a girl I knew.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe girl with the greyhound was an assistant lighting director for a musical comedy about American history, and she kept her poor greyhound, who was named Lancer, in a one-room apartment fourteen feet wide and twenty-six feet long, and six flights of stairs above street level. His entire life was devoted to unloading his excrement at the proper time and place. There were two proper places to put it: in the gutter outside the door seventy-two steps below, with the traffic whizzing by, or in a roasting pan his mistress kept in front of the Westinghouse refrigerator.\nLancer had a very small brain, but he must have suspected from time to time, just as Wayne Hoobler did, that some kind of terrible mistake had been made.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", -0.08063131313131314], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["pine", 0.028], ["devil", 0.024], ["tarbell", 0.02], ["dr", 0.012], ["counties", 0.012], ["county", 0.012], ["mayes", 0.012], ["years", 0.008], ["going", 0.008], ["big", 0.008], ["coast", 0.008], ["report", 0.008], ["bit", 0.008], ["operation", 0.008], ["centers", 0.008], ["current", 0.008], ["experiment", 0.008], ["hokum", 0.008], ["consideration", 0.008], ["laughable", 0.008], ["headsets", 0.008], ["hospital", 0.008], ["cept", 0.008], ["hole", 0.008], ["word", 0.008], ["heard", 0.008], ["ain", 0.008], ["figure", 0.008], ["rat", 0.008], ["ideas", 0.008], ["person", 0.008], ["time", 0.008], ["happen", 0.004], ["cried", 0.004], ["bear", 0.004], ["playful", 0.004], ["batteries", 0.004], ["experiments", 0.004], ["radio", 0.004], ["handed", 0.004], ["laments", 0.004], ["battle", 0.004], ["protecting", 0.004], ["find", 0.004], ["evicted", 0.004], ["jessie", 0.004], ["group", 0.004], ["jar", 0.004], ["tween", 0.004], ["folks", 0.004], ["lord", 0.004], ["wearing", 0.004], ["good", 0.004], ["confidential", 0.004], ["preferred", 0.004], ["smack", 0.004], ["day", 0.004], ["bank", 0.004], ["incoherent", 0.004], ["cases", 0.004], ["undertaking", 0.004], ["shock", 0.004], ["possibilities", 0.004], ["network", 0.004], ["investigate", 0.004], ["fringes", 0.004], ["recall", 0.004], ["small", 0.004], ["introduce", 0.004], ["concluded", 0.004], ["seventeen", 0.004], ["set", 0.004], ["thin", 0.004], ["obliged", 0.004], ["leter", 0.004], ["sensation", 0.004], ["dead", 0.004], ["worn", 0.004], ["uncomfortable", 0.004], ["hell", 0.004], ["dear", 0.004], ["air", 0.004], ["midst", 0.004], ["best", 0.004], ["headset", 0.004], ["playfulness", 0.004], ["announcer", 0.004], ["pictures", 0.004], ["imperceptible", 0.004], ["delaware", 0.004], ["expensive", 0.004], ["progress", 0.004], ["filled", 0.004], ["lipped", 0.004], ["theirselves", 0.004], ["pasts", 0.004], ["night", 0.004], ["free", 0.004], ["management", 0.004], ["preamble", 0.004], ["care", 0.004], ["pity", 0.004], ["boy", 0.004], ["great", 0.004], ["substance", 0.004], ["couldn", 0.004], ["involved", 0.004], ["terrible", 0.004], ["frightful", 0.004], ["regular", 0.004], ["place", 0.004], ["mildly", 0.004], ["tongue", 0.004], ["expense", 0.004], ["deranged", 0.004], ["spang", 0.004], ["bell", 0.004], ["northeastern", 0.004], ["earth", 0.004], ["unprotected", 0.004], ["sober", 0.004], ["objections", 0.004], ["theoretically", 0.004], ["oilfields", 0.004], ["warned", 0.004], ["people", 0.004], ["three", 0.004], ["unpleasant", 0.004], ["opposed", 0.004], ["passed", 0.004], ["goin", 0.004], ["exhaustion", 0.004], ["resting", 0.004], ["head", 0.004], ["hoped", 0.004], ["glass", 0.004], ["bible", 0.004], ["stick", 0.004], ["catch", 0.004], ["convinced", 0.004], ["97", 0.004], ["case", 0.004], ["evil", 0.004], ["room", 0.004], ["places", 0.004], ["adair", 0.004], ["science", 0.004], ["work", 0.004], ["photogenic", 0.004], ["wagoner", 0.004], ["theories", 0.004], ["middle", 0.004], ["matter", 0.004], ["stories", 0.004], ["supposed", 0.004], ["detectable", 0.004], ["balance", 0.004], ["called", 0.004], ["history", 0.004], ["fool", 0.004], ["craig", 0.004], ["nowata", 0.004], ["turned", 0.004], ["talking", 0.004], ["gonna", 0.004], ["concentration", 0.004], ["check", 0.004], ["huge", 0.004], ["tentative", 0.004], ["cherokee", 0.004], ["large", 0.004], ["assistant", 0.004], ["test", 0.004], ["intelligent", 0.004], ["week", 0.004], ["picture", 0.004], ["electric", 0.004], ["imaginable", 0.004], ["tied", 0.004], ["persons", 0.004], ["000", 0.004], ["trouble", 0.004], ["seemingly", 0.004], ["plenty", 0.004], ["tidying", 0.004], ["dullest", 0.004], ["prospecting", 0.004], ["extremely", 0.004], ["man", 0.004], ["forever", 0.004], ["attempt", 0.004], ["rogers", 0.004], ["possessed", 0.004], ["verdigris", 0.004], ["ottawa", 0.004], ["face", 0.004], ["absurd", 0.004], ["clean", 0.004], ["hearts", 0.004], ["oklahoma", 0.004], ["talk", 0.004], ["left", 0.004]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThen you think they\u2019re hokum?\u201d\n\u201cStick to the word \u2018playful,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Tarbell. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019ll investigate the history of science, my dear boy, I think you\u2019ll find that most of the really big ideas have come from intelligent playfulness. All the sober, thin-lipped concentration is really just a matter of tidying up around the fringes of the big ideas.\u201d\nBut the world preferred the word \u201chokum.\u201d And, in time, there were laughable pictures to go with the laughable stories from Verdigris. One was of a man wearing a headset that kept a small electric current going through his head, that was supposed to make him an uncomfortable resting place for the Devil. The current was said to be imperceptible, but I tried on one of the headsets, and found the sensation extremely unpleasant. Another photogenic experiment, I recall, was of a mildly deranged person talking about her past while under a huge glass bell-jar, which, it was hoped, might catch some detectable substance of the Devil, who was theoretically being evicted bit by bit. And on and on the picture possibilities went, each seemingly more absurd and expensive than the last.\nAnd then came what I called Operation Rat-hole. Because of it, Pine was obliged to look at his bank balance for the first time in years. And what he saw sent him prospecting for new oilfields. Because of the frightful expense involved, I opposed the undertaking. But, over my objections, Dr. Tarbell convinced Pine that the only way to test Devil theories was to experiment with a large group of people. Operation Rat-hole, then, was an attempt to make Nowata, Craig, Ottawa, Delaware, Adair, Cherokee, Wagoner, and Rogers counties Devil-free. As a check, Mayes County, in the midst of the others, was to be left unprotected.\nIn the first four counties, 97,000 of the headsets were passed out, to be worn, for a consideration, night and day. In the last four, centers were set up where persons were to come in, for a consideration, at least twice a week to talk their hearts out about their pasts. I turned over management of these centers to an assistant. I couldn\u2019t bear the places, where the air was forever filled with self-pity and the dullest laments imaginable.\nThree years leter, Dr. Tarbell handed Jessie L. Pine a confidential progress report on the experiments, and then went to the hospital with a case of exhaustion. He had made the report tentative, had warned Pine not to show it to anyone until more work\u2014much more\u2014had been done.\nIt came as a terrible shock to Tarbell when, on the radio in his hospital room, he heard an announcer introduce Pine on a coast-to-coast network, and he heard Pine say, after an incoherent preamble:\n\u201cAin\u2019t been a person possessed by the Devil in these here eight counties we been protecting. Plenty of old cases, but ain\u2019t no new ones, \u2019cept five that was tongue-tied and seventeen that let their batteries go dead. Meanwhile, smack spang in the middle, we let the Mayes County folks take care of theirselves the best they could, and they been goin\u2019 to hell regular as ever\u2026.\n\u201cTrouble with the world is and always has been the Devil,\u201d concluded Pine. \u201cWell, we done run him out of northeastern Oklahoma, \u2019cept for Mayes County, and I figure we can run him out of there, too, and clean off the face of the earth. Bible says there\u2019s gonna be a great battle \u2019tween good and evil by and by. Near\u2019s I can figure, this here\u2019s it.\u201d\n\u201cThe old fool!\u201d cried Tarbell. \u201cMy Lord, now what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d", 0.022943722943722954], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
