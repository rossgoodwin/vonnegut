to discover that years ago, and I am just as thrilled today. The apathy of the University of Chicago is repulsive to me.\nThey can take a flying fuck at the moooooooooooooooon.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd, my goodness, haven\u2019t we come far a field from the stated subject of this chapter, which is the sexual revolution? I have spoken elsewhere of how neophyte writers, and even some old poops in the field, will veer away from subjects which alarm them. Just look how far I myself have veered away from the subject of sex. There is little that is genuinely sexual in telling a great university to take a flying fuck at the moooooooooooooooon.\nAm I too much of a sissy to discuss anal intercourse, aphrodisiacs, armpits, bidets, birth control, bisexuality, bondage, buttocks, chastity belts, circumcision, clitorises, condoms, dildoes, discipline, ejaculation, feathers, femoral intercourse, fetishes, foursomes, frigidity, genitals, hair, hair-trigger trouble, impotence, karezza, kisses, and so on? I have lifted this list from the index of The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making (illustrated), edited by Alex Comfort, M.B., Ph.D. (Crown, 1972). Actually, I feel quite free to discuss any and all of those matters, and even to laugh some while doing so.\nWhat isn\u2019t congenial is an admission that I have been forced to be celibate for long periods of time. I search the index of The Joy of Sex in vain for \u201ccelibacy,\u201d which happens to be the most common human sexual adventure, and which could be illustrated nicely by a page as white as a snowdrift.\nTo take an example: I was a private in the United States Army (actually the Army of the United States, since I was a volunteer) for three years. I was one warrior ant in an enormous colony of identical ants, imprisoned in rural areas, and sent finally to an all-male battlefield in a foreign country. How many women eager to fuck me do you suppose I encountered in three long years? I could ask the same question about months and months in my civilian life, and get the same answer: to all practical purposes, none.\nI was talking one time to my friend Robert Penn Warren, a lusty old gentleman and a great poet and novelist, and I asked him about another majestic literary figure, dead, who had been an acquaintance of his. Mr. Warren is seventeen years older than I am. He was born in Guthrie, Kentucky, in 1905. He drew in words an enchantingly Edwardian caricature of the man I had asked about, and he concluded it with a statement which was in no wise a joke. It was meant to have clinical significance. A person versed in psychology and medicine, he seemed to say, would be able to extrapolate an entire syndrome from this one small clue. This was the clue: \u201cHe was a masturbator, of course.\u201d\nThis ended the conversation. I did not protest.

I was deeply moved by your reading to prisoners, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got a job. Your most recent good postcard was awaiting us when we came home last night from Europe\u2014five days in Paris, five in Moscow, five in Rome.\nRita is generally fine, and I was glad to learn from the guys at the Moscow bureau of the NYTimes that they all know how important she is culturally. They were eager to meet this legendary person, and I was delighted to perform the introductions.\nAs for who I met: cultural hacks mostly. The only distinguished writers I shook hands with were Voznesensky and Simonov. I was able, incidentally, to open a savings account over there. Crazy. I have about two-thousand roubles on deposit, earning two per cent a year. I gather that several favored writers have been allowed to do this. As far as I know, I am the first American. Also: they were petrified by the international copyright agreement, because they thought foreign literature would cost them so much. They are now elated, because writers are charging on the average less than half of what they expected to pay. Please don\u2019t publish this fact anywhere. I am advising my brother writers only in conversations. It wasn\u2019t Rita who told me this news, but people might assume that it was and want to hurt her in some way.\nI behaved politely. The theory is that my good behavior would do a lot to loosen up travel restrictions on Rita. That country sure is full of envy, by the way. Simonov drank a toast to this effect: \u201cWe all argue as to who our finest novelist is, who our finest poet is, who our finest playwright is\u2014but nobody argues about who our finest translator is.
