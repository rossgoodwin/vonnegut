Poet,\u201d is a slight misquotation of a locally popular poem of the period called \u201cAin\u2019t God Good to Indiana?\u201d by William Herschell. The refrain was: \u201cAin\u2019t God good to Indiana?/Ain\u2019t He, fellers? Ain\u2019t He though?\u201d Riley wrote a number of poems with similar style and sentiments that every Hoosier schoolkid of the era knew, like \u201cLittle Orphant Annie\u201d and \u201cWhen the Frost Is on the Punkin.\u201d\nArthur Godfrey\u2019s neighborly chatter and ukulele-strumming humor transformed him from a radio star into one of the first TV variety-show hosts and a household name in the 1950s.\nMay 11, 1954\nMark\u2019s 7th Birthday\nDear Knox:\nFind enclosed a package of Jack-and-the-Beanstalk-type seeds that got me through a very bad summer\u2014last summer. Every day I went out to see how much the things had grown, and every day I was flabbergasted. I would quote the late James Whitcomb Riley: \u201cAin\u2019t God good, fellers\u2014Ain\u2019t he, though?\u201d\nWhen you get right down to it, wit isn\u2019t any help anywhere\u2014and you and Otis having it out must have been brilliantly witty, if nothing else. Too bad.\nI bought a television set day before yesterday. Best sample of American enterprise I\u2019ve seen since a young man sold me a subscription to all the Crowell\u2013Collier publications five years ago. A guy came into my office (over the Osterville Package Store), and said, \u201cIt\u2019s about time you got television. You\u2019re going to have it by four this afternoon.\u201d He was a man in a genial mood to dicker, and he damn well wasn\u2019t going to leave without having made an offer I was bound to admit was reasonable. Hey presto!\nAt four, I began watching a parade of sad young men and women I thought had died with F. Scott Fitzgerald. Pretty damn good plays, most of them, gutsy, real, and beautifully produced. And almost all of them about New York. Unsettling business for an artist, where everything that happens in New York has universality, and everything that happens outside is ethnography.\nI wish you wouldn\u2019t tell me about people who are good writers and hold good jobs and inherit a lot of money besides.", 0.18988185425685428], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["humanists", 0.022727272727272728], ["sleep", 0.015151515151515152], ["isaac", 0.015151515151515152], ["dr", 0.015151515151515152], ["association", 0.015151515151515152], ["heaven", 0.015151515151515152], ["lost", 0.015151515151515152], ["humanist", 0.015151515151515152], ["dead", 0.015151515151515152], ["faith", 0.015151515151515152], ["asimov", 0.015151515151515152], ["thing", 0.015151515151515152], ["war", 0.015151515151515152], ["afterlife", 0.015151515151515152], ["thomas", 0.007575757575757576], ["bomb", 0.007575757575757576], ["rest", 0.007575757575757576], ["years", 0.007575757575757576], ["religions", 0.007575757575757576], ["atomic", 0.007575757575757576], ["21", 0.007575757575757576], ["interesting", 0.007575757575757576], ["sky", 0.007575757575757576], ["laughing", 0.007575757575757576], ["late", 0.007575757575757576], ["bernard", 0.007575757575757576], ["going", 0.007575757575757576], ["pride", 0.007575757575757576], ["hope", 0.007575757575757576], ["tics", 0.007575757575757576], ["torture", 0.007575757575757576], ["expectation", 0.007575757575757576], ["audience", 0.007575757575757576], ["lose", 0.007575757575757576], ["bernie", 0.007575757575757576], ["creator", 0.007575757575757576], ["hare", 0.007575757575757576], ["martial", 0.007575757575757576], ["chambers", 0.007575757575757576], ["enemies", 0.007575757575757576], ["capacity", 0.007575757575757576], ["honorably", 0.007575757575757576], ["god", 0.007575757575757576], ["bad", 0.007575757575757576], ["behave", 0.007575757575757576], ["honorable", 0.007575757575757576], ["numerous", 0.007575757575757576], ["trout", 0.007575757575757576], ["benjamin", 0.007575757575757576], ["business", 0.007575757575757576], ["requiem", 0.007575757575757576], ["rolled", 0.007575757575757576], ["joy", 0.007575757575757576], ["understanding", 0.007575757575757576], ["york", 0.007575757575757576], ["members", 0.007575757575757576], ["punishments", 0.007575757575757576], ["buddy", 0.007575757575757576], ["great", 0.007575757575757576], ["universe", 0.007575757575757576], ["roman", 0.007575757575757576], ["games", 0.007575757575757576], ["franklin", 0.007575757575757576], ["published", 0.007575757575757576], ["book", 0.007575757575757576], ["raised", 0.007575757575757576], ["forbid", 0.007575757575757576], ["third", 0.007575757575757576], ["prefer", 0.007575757575757576], ["scene", 0.007575757575757576], ["community", 0.007575757575757576], ["moral", 0.007575757575757576], ["amherst", 0.007575757575757576], ["president", 0.007575757575757576], ["swallowed", 0.007575757575757576], ["bingo", 0.007575757575757576], ["spoke", 0.007575757575757576], ["service", 0.007575757575757576], ["wag", 0.007575757575757576], ["people", 0.007575757575757576], ["skep", 0.007575757575757576], ["live", 0.007575757575757576], ["music", 0.007575757575757576], ["rewards", 0.007575757575757576], ["honorary", 0.007575757575757576], ["serve", 0.007575757575757576], ["lives", 0.007575757575757576], ["pacific", 0.007575757575757576], ["highest", 0.007575757575757576], ["room", 0.007575757575757576], ["boring", 0.007575757575757576], ["will", 0.007575757575757576], ["matter", 0.007575757575757576], ["organized", 0.007575757575757576], ["breathing", 0.007575757575757576], ["catholic", 0.007575757575757576], ["memorial", 0.007575757575757576], ["court", 0.007575757575757576], ["author", 0.007575757575757576], ["american", 0.007575757575757576], ["preachers", 0.007575757575757576], ["jefferson", 0.007575757575757576], ["abstraction", 0.007575757575757576], ["biochemist", 0.007575757575757576], ["knew", 0.007575757575757576], ["decently", 0.007575757575757576], ["aisles", 0.007575757575757576], ["unknowable", 0.007575757575757576], ["succeeded", 0.007575757575757576], ["floor", 0.007575757575757576], ["headquarters", 0.007575757575757576], ["ocean", 0.007575757575757576], ["thought", 0.007575757575757576], ["funniest", 0.007575757575757576], ["functionless", 0.007575757575757576], ["organization", 0.007575757575757576], ["talk", 0.007575757575757576]], "sentiment": ["21\nI am Honorary President of the American Humanist Association, whose headquarters in Amherst, New York, I have never seen. I succeeded the late author and biochemist Dr. Isaac Asimov in that functionless capacity. That we have an organization, a boring business, is to let others know we are numerous. We would prefer to live our lives as Humanists and not talk about it, or think more about it than we think about breathing.\nHumanists try to behave decently and honorably without any expectation of rewards or punishments in an afterlife. The creator of the Universe has been to us unknowable so far. We serve as well as we can the highest abstraction of which we have some understanding, which is our community.\nAre we enemies of members of organized religions? No. My great war buddy Bernard V. O\u2019Hare, now dead, lost his faith as a Roman Catholic during World War Two. I didn\u2019t like that. I thought that was too much to lose.\nI had never had faith like that, because I had been raised by interesting and moral people who, like Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, were nonetheless skep-tics about what preachers said was going on. But I knew Bernie had lost something important and honorable.\nAgain, I did not like that, did not like it because I liked him so much.\nI spoke at a Humanist Association memorial service for Dr. Asimov a few years back.

It twisted free from its last few feeble moorings, and it went bounding down the slate roof, and it went crashing, weather vane and all, onto Chief Morrisey\u2019s police car in the driveway below.\nThere was silence after that.\nI and the rest of Father\u2019s audience were at the foot of the gun-room ladder, looking up.

He never said anything to confirm this, but I think, and Felix agrees, that he was sufficiently adrift to imagine that wrecking the guns and decapitating the house would somehow settle everything. He intended to pay for his crime, the trusting of a child with firearms and live ammunition, before the bill could even be presented.

if you really want them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to the money I set aside to send Hope to New Hampshire. Figure I\u2019d better have her where I can keep my eyes on her.\u201d\nHe cleared his throat and continued. \u201cUnderstand,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to baby you. That\u2019d be the most unkind thing that I could possibly do.\u201d He scratched his head thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m doing it mainly to keep your hands off my daughter, and vice versa\u2014until you\u2019re a little older, anyway.\u201d\nIf God Were Alive Today\nA Novella\nCHAPTER 1\n\u201cWhen artificial intelligence was perfected, the most respected manufactured brain was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It had chosen its own name, which was \u2018M.I.T.\u2019 Computers had designed it, and then computers controlled the machines that made its parts, and it now took care of its own upgrading and maintenance. It had all knowledge in its memory, and it was telling all sorts of other machines what to do or say next. One day, \u2018Cal Tech,\u2019 the artificial intelligence at the California Institute of Technology, asked M.I.T. what it thought of people. M.I.T. needed only one word for an answer. The word was \u2018Obsolete.\u2019\n\u201cNext question? \u2018What were people for?\u2019 And M.I.T. replied: \u2018Paranoia, schizophrenia, depression, greed, ignorance, and stand-up comedy.\u2019\u201d\nThe above was part of a mostly new routine by the stand-up comedian Gil Berman. He was trying it out before a live audience now, on the night of December 12, 2000, on the stage of the Calvin Theater in Northampton, Massachusetts, in the same town with Smith College for Women, and only a few miles from the University of Massachusetts and from Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Hampshire Colleges. This was a college crowd, his kind of crowd. Unbeknownst to him, there were also five girls out there from the Nellie Prior Academy, a local college-preparatory boarding school, the most expensive in the country, for rich teenage girls unwelcome at home. The academy was next door to Smith. The five were members of the school\u2019s dramatic society, \u201cthe Mummers,\u201d and were of course chaperoned. The chaperone was a redheaded English teacher, drama coach, soccer coach, and dorm mom named Kimberley Berlin. Remember that name! The rest of the Mummers, about thirty in number, preferred to stay on campus and do homework or watch TV or shoot pool instead. They weren\u2019t allowed to use the telephone.\nBerman said, to them and everybody else there, \u201cAdolf Hitler is still alive. Adolf \u2019s in a rest home for retired SS officers and Gestapo agents in Argentina. Adolf says he is as sorry as he can be for any actions of his which, however indirectly, may have had anything to do with violent deaths suffered by 6 million Jews, 4 million Germans, including his girlfriend, and 22 million citizens of the Soviet Union during World War II.\u201d\nGil Berman was then forty-two, and he had been discharged only two months earlier from the Caldwell Institute, a drug-treatment complex in Salem, Wisconsin, founded in 1903\u2014in Berman\u2019s words, \u201cbefore Ritalin or Valium or Percodan or M&M\u2019s had been discovered, when opium and cocaine and morphine were in open stock at pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices. You didn\u2019t have to kill somebody to get some. Coca Cola contained cocaine. \u2018The pause that refreshes?\u2019 Tell me about it!

should take one. The coats were cemented together with ice, so the guards used their bayonets as ice picks, pricking free collars and hems and sleeves and so on, then peeling off coats and handing them out at random. The coats were stiff and dome-shaped, having conformed to their piles.\nThe coat that Billy Pilgrim got had been crumpled and frozen in such a way, and was so small, that it appeared to be not a coat but a sort of large black, three-cornered hat. There were gummy stains on it, too, like crankcase drainings or old strawberry jam. There seemed to be a dead, furry animal frozen to it. The animal was in fact the coat\u2019s fur collar.\nBilly glanced dully at the coats of his neighbors. Their coats all had brass buttons or tinsel or piping or numbers or stripes or eagles or moons or stars dangling from them. They were soldiers\u2019 coats. Billy was the only one who had a coat from a dead civilian. So it goes.\nAnd Billy and the rest were encouraged to shuffle around their dinky train and into the prison camp. There wasn\u2019t anything warm or lively to attract them\u2014merely long, low, narrow sheds by the thousands, with no lights inside.\nSomewhere a dog barked. With the help of fear and echoes and winter silences, that dog had a voice like a big bronze gong.\nBilly and the rest were wooed through gate after gate, and Billy saw his first Russian. The man was all alone in the night\u2014a ragbag with a round, flat face that glowed like a radium dial.\nBilly passed within a yard of him. There was barbed wire between them. The Russian did not wave or speak, but he looked directly into Billy\u2019s soul with sweet hopefulness, as though Billy might have good news for him\u2014news he might be too stupid to understand, but good news all the same.\nBilly blacked out as he walked through gate after gate. He came to in what he thought might be a building on Tralfamadore. It was shrilly lit and lined with white tiles. It was on Earth, though. It was a delousing station through which all new prisoners had to pass.\nBilly did as he was told, took off his clothes. That was the first thing they told him to do on Tralfamadore, too.\nA German measured Billy\u2019s upper right arm with his thumb and forefinger, asked a companion what sort of an army would send a weakling like that to the front. They looked at the other American bodies now, pointed out a lot more that were nearly as bad as Billy\u2019s.", 0.022294372294372297], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["fern", 0.042735042735042736], ["constant", 0.03418803418803419], ["desk", 0.02564102564102564], ["people", 0.02564102564102564], ["will", 0.02564102564102564], ["preferred", 0.017094017094017096], ["hotcake", 0.017094017094017096], ["opus", 0.017094017094017096], ["door", 0.017094017094017096], ["united", 0.017094017094017096], ["magnum", 0.017094017094017096], ["advice", 0.017094017094017096], ["shot", 0.008547008547008548], ["money", 0.008547008547008548], ["advised", 0.008547008547008548], ["years", 0.008547008547008548], ["follow", 0.008547008547008548], ["decisions", 0.008547008547008548], ["wright", 0.008547008547008548], ["dryly", 0.008547008547008548], ["touched", 0.008547008547008548], ["weeks", 0.008547008547008548], ["waltz", 0.008547008547008548], ["sitting", 0.008547008547008548], ["kitty", 0.008547008547008548], ["front", 0.008547008547008548], ["chairs", 0.008547008547008548], ["shuddered", 0.008547008547008548], ["leave", 0.008547008547008548], ["calls", 0.008547008547008548], ["guy", 0.008547008547008548], ["entitled", 0.008547008547008548], ["truer", 0.008547008547008548], ["guessing", 0.008547008547008548], ["bounce", 0.008547008547008548], ["brother", 0.008547008547008548], ["investment", 0.008547008547008548], ["forty", 0.008547008547008548], ["lights", 0.008547008547008548], ["levitation", 0.008547008547008548], ["nervously", 0.008547008547008548], ["plea", 0.008547008547008548], ["throw", 0.008547008547008548], ["stone", 0.008547008547008548], ["incoming", 0.008547008547008548], ["joke", 0.008547008547008548], ["inspired", 0.008547008547008548], ["months", 0.008547008547008548], ["favorite", 0.008547008547008548], ["turn", 0.008547008547008548], ["american", 0.008547008547008548], ["history", 0.008547008547008548], ["eyebrows", 0.008547008547008548], ["point", 0.008547008547008548], ["wall", 0.008547008547008548], ["directly", 0.008547008547008548], ["impossible", 0.008547008547008548], ["standing", 0.008547008547008548], ["three", 0.008547008547008548], ["lock", 0.008547008547008548], ["pencil", 0.008547008547008548], ["bowed", 0.008547008547008548], ["birchbark", 0.008547008547008548], ["spoken", 0.008547008547008548], ["wiping", 0.008547008547008548], ["broke", 0.008547008547008548], ["switchboard", 0.008547008547008548], ["raising", 0.008547008547008548], ["arranged", 0.008547008547008548], ["room", 0.008547008547008548], ["double", 0.008547008547008548], ["harder", 0.008547008547008548], ["air", 0.008547008547008548], ["called", 0.008547008547008548], ["mistake", 0.008547008547008548], ["lightly", 0.008547008547008548], ["canoe", 0.008547008547008548], ["gravely", 0.008547008547008548], ["moved", 0.008547008547008548], ["ransom", 0.008547008547008548], ["sir", 0.008547008547008548], ["sit", 0.008547008547008548], ["couch", 0.008547008547008548], ["fictitious", 0.008547008547008548], ["stock", 0.008547008547008548], ["sling", 0.008547008547008548], ["begging", 0.008547008547008548], ["paid", 0.008547008547008548], ["wrong", 0.008547008547008548], ["hawk", 0.008547008547008548], ["building", 0.008547008547008548], ["remember", 0.008547008547008548], ["succeeded", 0.008547008547008548], ["invest", 0.008547008547008548], ["bugs", 0.008547008547008548], ["edge", 0.008547008547008548], ["order", 0.008547008547008548]], "sentiment": ["\"United Hotcake preferred,\" said Fern.

private yacht, the Omoo, which was nearly as large as the cruise ship, and so could have gone to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands on his own\u2014without submitting to the close contacts with strangers and the disciplines which would be imposed by \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d The cruise passengers, for example, would not be able to go ashore whenever they pleased, and to behave there however they pleased. They were to be escorted and supervised at all times by guides, all of them trained by scientists at the Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, and all of them holding graduate degrees in one of the natural sciences.\nSo when King, making his rounds of restaurants and clubs one night, saw *MacIntosh and his daughter and her dog and two other people having a late supper in a celebrity hangout called Elaine\u2019s, he stopped by their table to say how pleased he was that they were taking the cruise. He wanted very much to hear why they were taking it\u2014so that he might use their reasons as inducements for other newsmakers to come along.\nOnly after greeting the MacIntoshes did King realize who the other two people at the table were. He knew them both to speak to, and he did so now. The woman was the most admired female on the planet, Mrs. Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, and her escort that evening was the great dancer Rudolf Nureyev.\nNureyev, incidentally, was a former citizen of the Soviet Union, who had been granted political asylum in Great Britain. And I was still alive then, and I was a United States citizen who had been granted political asylum in Sweden.\nYes, and we both liked to dance.\nAt the risk of reminding *MacIntosh that he owned an oceangoing yacht, King asked him what he had found so attractive about the Bah\u00eda de Darwin. *MacIntosh, who was highly intelligent and well read, thereupon delivered a speech on the damage selfish and ignorant persons had done to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands while going ashore un-supervised. This material was all lifted from an article in the National Geographic magazine, which he read from cover to cover every month. The magazine\u2019s point was that Ecuador would require a navy the size of the combined fleets of the world to keep persons from going ashore on the islands and doing as they pleased, so that the fragile habitats could be preserved only if individuals were educated to exercise self-restraint. \u201cNo good citizen of the planet,\u201d said the article, \u201cshould ever go ashore unless escorted by a well-trained guide.\u201d\nWhen Mary Hepburn and the Captain and Hisako Hiroguchi and Selena MacIntosh and the rest of them were marooned on Santa Rosalia, they would not have a trained guide along. And, for their first few years there, they would raise perfect hell with the fragile habitat.\nJust in the nick of time they realized that it was their own habitat they were wrecking\u2014that they weren\u2019t merely visitors.\nThere in Elaine\u2019s Restaurant, *MacIntosh angered his spellbound audience with tales of boots crushing the camouflaged nests of iguanas, of greedy fingers stealing the eggs of boobies, and on and on. His most moving atrocity story by far, though, again lifted from the National Geographic, was of persons cradling fur seal pups in their arms as though they were human infants\u2014for the sake of photographs. When the pup was returned to its mother, he said bitterly, she would no longer nurse it because its smell had been changed.\n\u201cSo what happens to that darling pup, which has just had the great honor of being cuddled by a bighearted nature lover?\u201d asked *MacIntosh. \u201cIt starves to death\u2014all for the sake of a photograph.\u201d", 0.21664965986394555], "title": "Galapagos"},

I have thought hard about this, and any answer I give refers to me, too. I was the best technician by far among the Abstract Expressionists, but I never amounted to a hill of beans, either, and couldn\u2019t have\u2014and I am not talking about my fiascoes with Sateen Dura-Luxe. I had painted plenty of pictures before Sateen Dura-Luxe, and quite a few afterwards, but they were no damned good.\nBut let\u2019s forget me for the moment, and focus on the works of Gregory. They were truthful about material things, but they lied about time. He celebrated moments, anything from a child\u2019s first meeting with a department store Santa Claus to the victory of a gladiator at the Circus Maximus, from the driving of the golden spike which completed a transcontinental railroad to a man\u2019s going on his knees to ask a woman to marry him. But he lacked the guts or the wisdom, or maybe just the talent, to indicate somehow that time was liquid, that one moment was no more important than any other, and that all moments quickly run away.\nLet me put it another way: Dan Gregory was a taxidermist. He stuffed and mounted and varnished and mothproofed supposedly great moments, all of which turn out to be depressing dust-catchers, like a moosehead bought at a country auction or a sailfish on the wall of a dentist\u2019s waiting room.\nClear?\nLet me put it yet another way: life, by definition, is never still. Where is it going? From birth to death, with no stops on the way. Even a picture of a bowl of pears on a checkered tablecloth is liquid, if laid on canvas by the brush of a master. Yes, and by some miracle I was surely never able to achieve as a painter, nor was Dan Gregory, but which was achieved by the best of the Abstract Expressionists, in the paintings which have greatness birth and death are always there.\nBirth and death were even on that old piece of beaverboard Terry Kitchen sprayed at seeming random so long ago. I don\u2019t know how he got them in there, and neither did he.\nI sigh. \u201cAh, me,\u201d says old Rabo Karabekian.\n10\nBACK IN 1933:\nI told a policeman in Grand Central Station Dan Gregory\u2019s address. He said it was only eight blocks away, and that I couldn\u2019t get lost, since that part of the city was as simple as a checkerboard. The Great Depression was going on, so that the station and the streets teemed with homeless people, just as they do today. The newspapers were full of stories of worker layoffs and farm foreclosures and bank failures, just as they are today. All that has changed, in my opinion, is that, thanks to television, we can hide a Great Depression.

The shells burst in the treetops right over us. Those were very loud bangs right over our heads. We were showered with splintered steel. Some people got hit. Then the Germans told us again to come out. We didn\u2019t yell \u201cnuts\u201d or anything like that. We said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and \u201cTake it easy,\u201d and so on.

The tragedy of the planet was that its scientists found ways to extract time from topsoil and the oceans and the atmosphere\u2014to heat their homes and power their speedboats and fertilize their crops with it; to eat it; to make cloches out of it; and so on. They served time at every meal, fed it to household pets, just to demonstrate how rich and clever they were. They allowed great gobbets of it to putrefy to oblivion in their overflowing garbage cans.\n\u201cOn Vicuna,\u201d says the judge, \u201cwe lived as though there were no tomorrow.\u201d\nThe patriotic bonfires of time were the worst, he says. When he was an infant, his parents held him up to coo and gurgle with delight as a million years of future were put to the torch in honor of the birthday of the queen. But by the time he was fifty, only a few weeks of future remained. Great rips in reality were appearing everywhere. People could walk through walls. His own speedboat became nothing more than a steering wheel. Holes appeared in vacant lots where children were playing, and the children fell in.\nSo all the Vicunians had to get out of their bodies and sail out into space without further ado. \u201cTing-a-ling,\u201d they said to Vicuna.\n\u201cChronological anomalies and gravitational thunderstorms and magnetic whirlpools tore the Vicunian families apart in space,\u201d the story goes on, \u201cscattered them far and wide.\u201d The judge manages to stay with his formerly beautiful daughter for a while. She isn\u2019t beautiful anymore, of course, because she no longer has a body. She finally loses heart, because every planet or moon they come to is so lifeless. Her father, having no way to restrain her, watches helplessly as she enters a crack in a rock and becomes its soul. Ironically, she does this on the moon of Earth, with that most teeming of all planets only two hundred and thirty-nine thousand miles away!\nBefore he actually lands at the Air Force base, though, he falls in with a flock of turkey buzzards. He wheels and soars with them and almost enters the ear of one. For all he knows about the social situation on Earth, these carrion eaters may be members of the ruling class.\nHe decides that lives led at the center of the Air Force base are too busy, too unreflective for him, so he goes up in the air again and spots a much more quiet cluster of buildings, which he thinks may be a meditation center for philosophers. He has no way of recognizing the place as a minimum security prison for white-collar criminals, since there were no such institutions back on Vicuna.\nBack on Vicuna, he says, convicted white-collar criminals, defilers of trustingness, had their ears plugged up, so their souls couldn\u2019t get out. Then their bodies were put into artificial ponds filled with excrement\u2014up to their necks. Then deputy sheriffs drove high-powered speedboats at their heads.\nThe judge says he himself sentenced hundreds of people to this particular punishment and that the felons invariably argued that they had not broken the law, but merely violated its spirit, perhaps, just the least little bit. Before he condemned them, he would put a sort of chamberpot over his head, to make his words more resonant and awesome, and he would pronounce this formula: \u201cBoys, you didn\u2019t just get the spirit of the law.

He saw her rod bend double, heard the reel scream like a little siren. But he never got to see the monster who had taken her bait and was headed south for Scipio. Before he could see it, he was back in darkness in another van.\nIT WAS HEAVY test line I had put on the reel. This was deep-sea stuff made for tuna and shark, although, as far as we knew, there was nothing in Lake Mohiga but eels and perch and little catfish. That was all Mildred had ever caught before.\nOne time, I remember, she caught a perch too little to keep. So I turned it loose, even though the barb of the hook had come out through one eye. A few minutes later she hooked that same perch again. We could tell by the mangled eye. Think about that. Miraculous eyes, and no brains whatsoever.\nI PUT SUCH heavy test line on Mildred\u2019s reel so that nothing could ever get away from her. In Honduras 1 time I did the same thing for a 3-star General, whose aide I was.\nMildred\u2019s fish couldn\u2019t snap the line, and Mildred wouldn\u2019t let go of the rod. She didn\u2019t weigh anything, and the fish weighed a lot for a fish. Mildred went down on her knees in the water, laughing and crying.\nI\u2019ll never forget what she was saying: \u201cIt\u2019s God! It\u2019s God!\u201d\nI WADED OUT to help her.

slab of steak from the freezer, and Earl held it over the grill. \u201cHurry up,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t hold a cow at arm\u2019s length all day.\u201d Behind his smile, however, he was nettled by Charley\u2019s bland dismissal of his college grievances.\n\u201cHold it!\u201d said Slotkin. The flashbulbs went off. \u201cGood!\u201d\nAnd the party moved indoors. There, Earl and Maude posed in room after room, watering a plant in the solarium, reading the latest book before the living room fireplace, working pushbutton windows, chatting with the maid over the laundry console, planning menus, having a drink at the rumpus room bar, sawing a plank in the workshop, dusting off Earl\u2019s gun collection in the den.\nAnd always, there was Charley Freeman at the rear of the entourage, missing nothing, obviously amused as Maude and Earl demonstrated their packaged good life. Under Charley\u2019s gaze, Earl became more and more restless and self-conscious as he performed, and Slotkin berated him for wearing such a counterfeit smile.\n\u201cBy God, Maude,\u201d said Earl, perspiring in the master bedroom, \u201cif I ever have to come out of retirement\u2014knock on wood\u2014I can go on television as a quick-change artist.
