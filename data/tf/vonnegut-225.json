Salo had sent his message of distress home with the speed of light, and it had taken one hundred and fifty thousand years to reach Tralfamadore. He had received a reply from Tralfamadore in less than fifty thousand years.\nIt is grotesque for anyone as primitive as an Earthling to explain how these swift communications were effected. Suffice it to say, in such primitive company, that the Tralfamadorians were able to make certain impulses from the Universal Will to Become echo through the vaulted architecture of the Universe with about three times the speed of light. And they were able to focus and modulate these impulses so as to influence creatures far, far away, and inspire them to serve Tralfamadorian ends.\nIt was a marvelous way to get things done in places far, far away from Tralfamadore. It was easily the fastest way.\nBut it wasn\u2019t cheap.\nOld Salo was not equipped himself to communicate and get things done in this way, even over short distances. The apparatus and the quantities of Universal Will to Become used in the process were colossal, and they demanded the services of thousands of technicians.\nAnd even the heavily-powered, heavily-manned, heavily-built apparatus of Tralfamadore was not particularly accurate. Old Salo had watched many communications failures on Earth. Civilizations would start to bloom on Earth, and the participants would start to build tremendous structures that were obviously to be messages in Tralfamadorian \u2014 and then the civilizations would poop out without having finished the messages.\nOld Salo had seen this happen hundreds of times.\nOld Salo had told his friend Rumfoord a lot of interesting things about the civilization of Tralfamadore, but he had never told Rumfoord about the messages and the techniques of their delivery.\nAll that he had told Rumfoord was that he had sent home a distress message, and that he expected a replacement part to come any day now. Old Salo\u2019s mind was so different from Rumfoord\u2019s that Rumfoord couldn\u2019t read Salo\u2019s mind.\nSalo was grateful for that barrier between their thoughts, because he was mortally afraid of what Rumfoord might say if he found out that Salo\u2019s people had so much to do with gumming up the history of Earth. Even though Rumfoord was chrono-synclastic infundibulated, and might be expected to take a larger view of things, Salo had found Rumfoord to be, still, a surprisingly parochial Earthling at heart.", 0.1554945054945055], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["papa", 0.09433962264150944], ["president", 0.05660377358490566], ["san", 0.03773584905660377], ["good", 0.03773584905660377], ["ice", 0.03773584905660377], ["lorenzo", 0.03773584905660377], ["bye", 0.03773584905660377], ["eyes", 0.03773584905660377], ["neck", 0.03773584905660377], ["body", 0.018867924528301886], ["weight", 0.018867924528301886], ["von", 0.018867924528301886], ["crown", 0.018867924528301886], ["sightless", 0.018867924528301886], ["whimpered", 0.018867924528301886], ["brought", 0.018867924528301886], ["bring", 0.018867924528301886], ["previous", 0.018867924528301886], ["asks", 0.018867924528301886], ["better", 0.018867924528301886], ["going", 0.018867924528301886], ["music", 0.018867924528301886], ["bugging", 0.018867924528301886], ["friend", 0.018867924528301886], ["whispered", 0.018867924528301886], ["evening", 0.018867924528301886], ["rolled", 0.018867924528301886], ["frank", 0.018867924528301886], ["relaxed", 0.018867924528301886], ["xylophone", 0.018867924528301886], ["finish", 0.018867924528301886], ["finished", 0.018867924528301886], ["arched", 0.018867924528301886], ["soothe", 0.018867924528301886], ["mona", 0.018867924528301886], ["bed", 0.018867924528301886], ["matter", 0.018867924528301886], ["gasped", 0.018867924528301886], ["head", 0.018867924528301886], ["koenigswald", 0.018867924528301886]], "sentiment": ["Mona\u2019s xylophone was near the bed.

Euphio will do everything he says it will. The happiness it give is perfect and unflagging in the face of incredible adversity. Near tragedies, such as the first experiment, can no doubt be avoided with clockwork to turn the sets on and off. I see that this set on the table before you is, in fact, equipped with clockwork.\nThe question is not whether euphio works. It does. The question is, rather, whether or not America is to enter a new and distressing phase of history where men no longer pursue happiness but buy it. This is no time for oblivion to become a national craze. The only benefit we could get from euphio would be if we could somehow lay down a peace-of-mind barrage on our enemies while protecting our own people from it.\nIn closing, I\u2019d like to point out that Lew Harrison, the would-be czar of euphio, is an unscrupulous person, unworthy of public trust. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me, for instance, if he had set the clockwork on this sample euphio set so that its radiations would addle your judgments when you are trying to make a decision. In fact, it seems to be whirring suspiciously at this very moment, and I\u2019m so happy I could cry. I\u2019ve got the swellest little kid and the swellest bunch of friends and the swellest old wife in the world. And good old Lew Harrison is the salt of the earth, believe me. I sure wish him a lot of good luck with his new enterprise.\n(1951)\nGO BACK TO YOUR PRECIOUS WIFE AND SON\nGLORI HILTON and her fifth husband didn\u2019t live in New Hampshire very long. But they lived there long enough for me to sell them a bathtub enclosure. My main line is aluminum combination storm windows and screens\u2014but anybody in storm windows is practically automatically in bathtub enclosures, too.\nThe enclosure they ordered was for Gloria Hilton\u2019s personal bathtub. I guess that was the zenith of my career. Some men are asked to build mighty dams or noble sky-scrapers, or conquer terrible plagues, or lead great armies into battle.\nMe?\nI was asked to keep drafts off the most famous body in the world.\nPeople ask me how well did I know Gloria Hilton. I generally say, \"The only time I ever saw that woman in the flesh was through a hot-air register.\" That was how the bathroom where they wanted the enclosure was heated\u2014with a hot-air register in the floor. It wasn\u2019t connected to the furnace. It just bled heat from the ceiling of the room down below.

I have been head of a family since I was four years younger than Mark, and I have had to scramble some. If I start to fail even now, it will be bad news for a lot of people. So my continued interest in success, which may seem unattractive, has to do with my gang, not just me. I would rather be a philosopher king with no property but a wooden bowl. Or maybe I wouldn\u2019t like that so much, after all. This is fun, too, and often satisfying. I get to talk to really good artists a lot of the time, and they nourish me.\nAnd Jill nourishes me, and she will be less jumpy every time you come around, and you will become less jumpy. She has been very smart about helping me to put myself back together again. And, while she sometimes says she would really love to have a baby, since she is only human, we aren\u2019t really going to do that. Neither does she egg me on to hurry up with the divorce, which must now be the slowest divorce in history. Neither does she take any interest in the details of the divorce. We simply try to live pleasantly and fruitfully from day to day.\nWish me luck with my next book, which, like all the others, is refusing to be written. I hope it\u2019s a good one, so you\u2019ll be proud of me.\nI am trying to be as generous and gentle with your good mother as I can. She seems to become stronger day by day. I\u2019m glad about that.\nOne thing that makes all my books tough to write is that I try to tell stories without the almost essential elements of blame and villainy.\nThis letter would be a horrible one to answer, I think. So please don\u2019t try. Just know that I love you, and that I wish you knew me, for good or ill, better than you do.\nK\nJune 25, 1974\nNew York City\nTO WILLIAM STYRON", 0.15183558271793568], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["harold", 0.2727272727272727], ["penelope", 0.18181818181818182], ["dozen", 0.18181818181818182], ["funeral", 0.09090909090909091], ["hear", 0.09090909090909091], ["paul", 0.09090909090909091], ["corpse", 0.09090909090909091]], "sentiment": ["I came for Paul as well.\nHAROLD\nIf he wants to go.\nPENELOPE\nYou took him to the funeral, I hear.\nHAROLD\nHe'd never seen a corpse.
