Sarah genuinely wanted to hear me imitate my mother\u2019s laugh, something I used to do a lot for Sarah on the telephone. I had not tried the trick in years. I not only had to make my voice high: I also had to make it beautiful.\nThe thing was this: Mother never laughed out loud. She had been trained to stifle her laughter when a servant girl in Lithuania. The idea was that a master or guest, hearing a servant laughing somewhere in the house, might suspect that the servant was laughing about him.\nSo when my mother could not help laughing, she made tiny, pure sounds like a music box\u2014or perhaps like bells far away. It was accidental that they were so beautiful.\nSo\u2014forgetful of where I was, I now filled my lungs and tightened my throat, and to please my old girl friend, I reincarnated the laughing part of my mother.\nIt was at that point that Arpad Leen and Frank Ubriaco came back into the living room. They heard the end of my song.\nI told Sarah that I had to hang up now, and I did hang up.\nArpad Leen stared at me hard. I had heard women speak of men\u2019s undressing them mentally. Now I was finding out what that felt like. As things turned out, that was exactly what Leen was doing to me: imagining what I would look like with no clothes on.\nHe was beginning to suspect that I was Mrs. Jack Graham, checking up on him while disguised as a man.\n22\nI COULD NOT KNOW THAT, of course\u2014that he thought I might be Mrs. Graham.

There aren\u2019t any redheads anymore. I never knew an albino personally, but there aren\u2019t albinos anymore, either. Among the fur seals, albinos do still turn up from time to time. Their pelts would have been much prized for ladies\u2019 fur coats a million years ago, to be worn to the opera and charity balls.\nWould the pelts of modern people have made nice fur coats for their ancestors in olden times? I don\u2019t see why not.\nDoes it trouble me to write so insubstantially, with air on air?

On the day it opened, there were already young black people wearing jackets which looked like this from the back:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI have to explain, too, see, why so many black people in Midland City were able to imitate birds from various parts of what used to be the British Empire. The thing was, see, that Fred T. Barry and his mother and father were almost the only people in Midland City who could afford to hire Niggers to do the Nigger work during the Great Depression. They took over the old Keedsler Mansion, where Beatrice Keedsler, the novelist, had been born. They had as many as twenty servants working there, all at one time.\nFred\u2019s father got so much money during the prosperity of the twenties as a bootlegger and as a swindler in stocks and bonds. He kept all his money in cash, which turned out to be a bright thing to do, since so many banks failed during the Great Depression. Also: Fred\u2019s father was an agent for Chicago gangsters who wanted to buy legitimate businesses for their children and grandchildren. Through Fred\u2019s father, those gangsters bought almost every desirable property in Midland City for anything from a tenth to a hundredth of what it was really worth.\nAnd before Fred\u2019s mother and father came to the United States after the First World War, they were music hall entertainers in England. Fred\u2019s father played the musical saw. His mother imitated birds from various parts of what was still the British Empire.\nShe went on imitating them for her own amusement, well into the Great Depression. \u201cThe Bulbul of Malaysia,\u201d she would say, for instance, and then she would imitate that bird.\n\u201cThe Morepark Owl of New Zealand,\u201d she would say, and then she would imitate that bird.\nAnd all the black people who worked for her thought her act was the funniest thing they had ever seen, though they never laughed out loud when she did it. And, in order to double up their friends and relatives with laughter, they, too, learned how to imitate the birds.\nThe craze spread. Black people who had never been near the Keedsler mansion could imitate the Lyre Bird and the Willy Wagtail of Australia, the Golden Oriole of India, the Nightingale and the Chaffinch and the Wren and the Chiffchaff of England itself.\nThey could even imitate the happy screech of the extinct companion of Kilgore Trout\u2019s island childhood, which was the Bermuda Em.", 0.1667508417508417], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["grace", 0.06040268456375839], ["george", 0.04697986577181208], ["house", 0.026845637583892617], ["thing", 0.026845637583892617], ["years", 0.020134228187919462], ["going", 0.020134228187919462], ["someday", 0.020134228187919462], ["mcclellans", 0.020134228187919462], ["time", 0.020134228187919462], ["nice", 0.013422818791946308], ["bit", 0.013422818791946308], ["month", 0.013422818791946308], ["anne", 0.013422818791946308], ["met", 0.013422818791946308], ["fuller", 0.013422818791946308], ["dowdier", 0.013422818791946308], ["sad", 0.013422818791946308], ["interior", 0.013422818791946308], ["bait", 0.006711409395973154], ["money", 0.006711409395973154], ["fond", 0.006711409395973154], ["planning", 0.006711409395973154], ["distant", 0.006711409395973154], ["talks", 0.006711409395973154], ["follow", 0.006711409395973154], ["smiling", 0.006711409395973154], ["talkative", 0.006711409395973154], ["decorating", 0.006711409395973154], ["better", 0.006711409395973154], ["harmless", 0.006711409395973154], ["inherited", 0.006711409395973154], ["friendly", 0.006711409395973154], ["happened", 0.006711409395973154], ["increased", 0.006711409395973154], ["compassion", 0.006711409395973154], ["conversations", 0.006711409395973154], ["drinking", 0.006711409395973154], ["listening", 0.006711409395973154], ["performing", 0.006711409395973154], ["tenderness", 0.006711409395973154], ["bad", 0.006711409395973154], ["disparage", 0.006711409395973154], ["financial", 0.006711409395973154], ["people", 0.006711409395973154], ["relative", 0.006711409395973154], ["decided", 0.006711409395973154], ["mmmmm", 0.006711409395973154], ["dear", 0.006711409395973154], ["bore", 0.006711409395973154], ["ways", 0.006711409395973154], ["fingers", 0.006711409395973154], ["brunt", 0.006711409395973154], ["christian", 0.006711409395973154], ["refused", 0.006711409395973154], ["pleasant", 0.006711409395973154], ["invented", 0.006711409395973154], ["dishwasher", 0.006711409395973154], ["months", 0.006711409395973154], ["virus", 0.006711409395973154], ["minds", 0.006711409395973154], ["adored", 0.006711409395973154], ["magazine", 0.006711409395973154], ["horizon", 0.006711409395973154], ["ignored", 0.006711409395973154], ["appeared", 0.006711409395973154], ["patience", 0.006711409395973154], ["magazines", 0.006711409395973154], ["dreaming", 0.006711409395973154], ["neighborhood", 0.006711409395973154], ["service", 0.006711409395973154], ["spending", 0.006711409395973154], ["hospital", 0.006711409395973154], ["habit", 0.006711409395973154], ["jam", 0.006711409395973154], ["passed", 0.006711409395973154], ["meeting", 0.006711409395973154], ["sort", 0.006711409395973154], ["happily", 0.006711409395973154], ["formed", 0.006711409395973154], ["infection", 0.006711409395973154], ["flag", 0.006711409395973154], ["hear", 0.006711409395973154], ["keeping", 0.006711409395973154], ["grew", 0.006711409395973154], ["talking", 0.006711409395973154], ["recede", 0.006711409395973154], ["excitement", 0.006711409395973154], ["weren", 0.006711409395973154], ["share", 0.006711409395973154], ["decoration", 0.006711409395973154], ["drawer", 0.006711409395973154], ["file", 0.006711409395973154], ["contents", 0.006711409395973154], ["cabinets", 0.006711409395973154], ["newsstands", 0.006711409395973154], ["things", 0.006711409395973154], ["mcclellan", 0.006711409395973154], ["neighborly", 0.006711409395973154], ["preoccupation", 0.006711409395973154], ["fairly", 0.006711409395973154], ["exactly", 0.006711409395973154], ["track", 0.006711409395973154], ["drink", 0.006711409395973154], ["tact", 0.006711409395973154], ["running", 0.006711409395973154], ["friends", 0.006711409395973154], ["discourage", 0.006711409395973154], ["wife", 0.006711409395973154], ["light", 0.006711409395973154], ["filing", 0.006711409395973154]], "sentiment": ["\"Mmmmm?\" Grace said, smiling at some distant horizon. \"Oh\u2014dishwasher? No, but I know exactly the one we want. We\u2019ve made up our minds on that, haven\u2019t we, George?\"\n\"Yes, dear.\"\n\"And someday... said Grace happily, running her fingers over the contents of a file drawer.\n\"Someday ...\" said George.\nAs I say, two years have passed since then, since we first met the McClellans. Anne, with compassion and tenderness, invented harmless ways of keeping Grace from spending all her time at our house with her magazines. But we formed a neighborly habit of having a drink with the McClellans once or twice a month.\nI liked George, and he grew friendly and talkative when he\u2019d made sure we weren\u2019t going to bait his wife about interior decorating, something almost everyone else in the neighborhood was fond of doing. He adored Grace, and made light of her preoccupation, as he had done at our first meeting, only when he didn\u2019t know the people before whom she was performing. Among friends, he did nothing to discourage or disparage her dreaming.\nAnne bore the brunt of Grace\u2019s one-track conversations as sort of a Christian service, listening with tact and patience. George and I ignored them, and had a pleasant enough time talking about everything but interior decoration.\nIn these talks it came out bit by bit that George had been in a bad financial jam for years, and that things refused to get better. The \"someday\" that Grace had been planning for for five years, George said, seemed to recede another month as each new home magazine appeared on the newsstands. It was this, I decided, not Grace, that kept him drinking more than his share.\nAnd the filing cabinets got fuller and fuller, and the McClellan house got dowdier and dowdier. But not once did Grace\u2019s excitement about what their house was going to be like flag. If anything, it increased, and time and again we would have to follow her about the house to hear just how it was all going to be.\nAnd then a fairly sad thing and an awfully nice thing happened to the McClellans. The sad thing was that Grace came down with a virus infection that kept her in the hospital two months.

here, was take a shot at him with a pistol. Kitchen was drunk then, as he often was, and his father had come for the umpteenth time to beg him to get treatment for his alcoholism. It can never be proved, but that shot had to have been intended as a gesture.\nWhen Kitchen saw that he had actually gunned down his father, with a bullet in the shoulder, it turned out, nothing would do but that Kitchen put the pistol barrel in his own mouth and kill himself.\nIt was an accident.\nIt was on that fateful truck trip, too, that I got my first look at Edith Taft Fairbanks, who would be my second wife. I had negotiated the rental of the barn from her husband, who was an affable idler, who seemed a useless, harmless waster of life to me back then, but who would become the role model I kept in mind when he died and I became her husband.\nProphetically, she was carrying a tamed raccoon in her arms. She was a magical tamer of almost any sort of animal, an overwhelmingly loving and uncritical nurturer of anything and everything that looked half alive. That\u2019s what she would do to me when I was living as a hermit in the barn and she needed a new husband: she tamed me with nature poems and good things to eat which she left outside my sliding doors. I\u2019m sure she tamed her first husband, too, and thought of him lovingly and patronizingly as some kind of dumb animal.\nShe never said what kind of animal she thought he was. I know what kind of animal she thought I was, because she came right out and said it to a female relative from Cincinnati at our wedding reception, when I was all dressed up in my Izzy Finkelstein suit: \u201cI want you to meet my tamed raccoon.\u201d\nI will be buried in that suit, too. It says so in my will: \u201cI am to be buried next to my wife Edith in Green River Cemetery in the dark blue suit whose label says: \u2018Made to order for Rabo Karabekian by Isadore Finkelstein.\u2019\u201d It wears and wears.\nWell\u2014the execution of that will still lies in the future, but just about everything else has vanished into the past, including Circe Berman. She finished up her book and returned to Baltimore two weeks ago.\nOn her last night here, she wanted me to take her dancing, and I again refused. I took her to supper at the American Hotel in Sag Harbor instead. Just another tourist trap nowadays, Sag Harbor used to be a whaling port. You can still see the mansions of the brave captains who sailed from there to the Pacific Ocean, around the tip of South America, and then came home millionaires.\nIn the lobby of the hotel is a guest register opened to a date at the peak of the whale-killing industry, so disreputable nowadays: March 1, 1849. Back then, Circe\u2019s ancestors were in the Russian Empire and mine in the Turkish Empire, which would have made them enemies.", 0.14062139249639247], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["lowell", 0.10344827586206896], ["madelaine", 0.06896551724137931], ["kiss", 0.06896551724137931], ["marry", 0.06896551724137931], ["love", 0.034482758620689655], ["simple", 0.034482758620689655], ["nonsense", 0.034482758620689655], ["palm", 0.034482758620689655], ["arm", 0.034482758620689655], ["meekly", 0.034482758620689655], ["opened", 0.034482758620689655], ["long", 0.034482758620689655], ["slowly", 0.034482758620689655], ["dreadfully", 0.034482758620689655], ["knife", 0.034482758620689655], ["idea", 0.034482758620689655], ["realize", 0.034482758620689655], ["worlds", 0.034482758620689655], ["drum", 0.034482758620689655], ["walked", 0.034482758620689655], ["will", 0.034482758620689655], ["farewell", 0.034482758620689655], ["asked", 0.034482758620689655], ["silence", 0.034482758620689655]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHe asked me to marry him, Lowell.\u201d\n\u201cOh?

adopted him, the same age as my natural son Mark. He was the least dependent of the lot, being a superb athlete and having joined an alternative family long before his parents died, the worldwide family of coaches and teammates and competitors everywhere. Coaches on Cape Cod, just like the coaches in New Jersey, greeted him like a long-lost son.\nSteve arrived on Cape Cod wearing a jacket with this emblazoned on the back: \u201cNew Jersey Little League All-Stars.\u201d Further introductions were unnecessary.\nHe went to Dartmouth, where he studied English literature and played end. He is in Los Angeles now, a professional writer of comedy for television shows. He is thirty-three and has never married, and he runs a lot.\nI know Steve least well of all my children, since, to his credit, he has had the least need of me. At the same time, he is the only one who has chosen to become what I am, which is a full-time writer. His work now is entirely comical. As far as I know, he will not begin a piece unless it promises to lead him at once to a joke of some kind. He is well paid for unseriousness. If he ever became serious, he would lose his job.\nHis job also requires him to ignore all he learned at Dartmouth of history and literature and philosophy and what have you, and to joke only about matters with which his audience is familiar, recent television commercials, celebrities of the moment, big-grossing motion pictures of the past year, extraordinarily popular records, political figures in the news incessantly, and on and on. This must become tiresome.\nHe is the most rootless of my children, and the one most likely to drift away. If he reproduces, his children, in California, perhaps, will never find out, probably, unless they read this book, that they are de St. Andr\u00e9s and have second cousins named Carl Hiroaki Vonnegut and Emiko Alice Vonnegut and on and on.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSteve\u2019s younger brother Kurt Adams, nine years old when we adopted him, also lives in Leverett, near his brother Jim. Kurt was the first of the brothers to settle there. He is thirty-two now, and a pilot for Air New England, and a builder on speculation of beautiful post-and-beam houses which are entirely heated by wood stoves. He lives in such a house himself. He is married to an excellent artist named Lindsay Palermo. So far, they have not had a child.\nKurt is the only canny business person of the lot. He is of modest means, but he makes satisfying gains on small investments.
