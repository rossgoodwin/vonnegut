novel, published that year by Scribner. \u201cMax\u201d is Max Wilkinson, one of Kurt\u2019s original agents along with his partner Kenneth Littauer. Knox has left Collier\u2019s to become a book editor for Dell, a paperback publisher. \u201cOtis\u201d is Knox Burger\u2019s first wife.\nDear Knox:\nIt\u2019s good of you to read the book and take an interest in it. I\u2019m sorry about its roughnesses and slow passages. So help me God, I didn\u2019t know they were there. They wouldn\u2019t have been there (in profusion, I guess) if the book had passed through the hands of an editor, but it went from me to the typesetters, [\u2026] What roughnesses and slow passages are you talking about? [\u2026]\nSome enterprising advertising salesman sold Scribner\u2019s on advertising the book in S-F magazines, or they wouldn\u2019t have thought of it. I took Rosenau to Scribner\u2019s so he could give their advertising & publicity set-up the double-0, and he was favorably impressed. Young and enthusiastic and optimistic and energetic, said Rosenau, though inexperienced (in terms of Rosenau). $1500 has been appropriated for them to spread around on ads for the book, and it\u2019s going to go to some S-F magazines, The New Yorker, the Saturday Review, and the N.Y. Times Book Review. And there\u2019s a fair chance, I hear, of our getting a couple of $35,000 pages from Life for nothing. Nothing sure about that, of course. I saw a G-E career broken once, because a guy went around telling all the vice presidents that he\u2019d placed a big G-E story with Life. It\u2019s been about five years since Life accepted it, and any day now \u2026\nI guess the jacket is pretty dead. I was on it originally, but was taken off because the green made me look like death warmed over. That\u2019s what they said.\nI\u2019d love to make Max sweat, Knox, but I\u2019ve never got it straight what it is he\u2019s supposed to do for me. I hope to become a more difficult client as time goes on, but right now I don\u2019t know what to ask for.\nExciting new things happening to Collier\u2019s. A fiction folio. What alarms me is the ease with which the folio may be detached from the rest of the book. And so many surgeons looking for a quick and easy reputation. Fictionectomy. Dakin\u2019s incision. Literary jim-crowism (step to the back of the bus).\nMaybe it\u2019s a fine thing. The fiction folio in the 7/26 issue looked more substantial and interesting than the article folio. As long as fiction is going to be set apart, the point of separation in the book should be more dramatic than it is. I didn\u2019t find the little red box on page 42 until the third trip through. If the articles get any worse, the fiction folio should secede.\nFor $20,000, I will put the article side back on its feet during the next year. I was editor of the General Electric Monogram, which never lost a subscriber. This is a firm offer. Love to Otis.\nKurt", 0.15841883116883115], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["trout", 0.030303030303030304], ["sodium", 0.020202020202020204], ["years", 0.015151515151515152], ["motion",

Trout couldn\u2019t hear him. There was a thick masonry wall between them as the paraplegic composer ranted on about the seeming mania for making people compete with machines that were smarter than they were.\nPepper asked this rhetorical question: \u201cWhy is it so important that we all be humiliated, with such ingenuity and at such great expense? We never thought we were such hot stuff in the first place.\u201d\nTrout was sitting on his cot in a shelter for homeless men that was once the Museum of the American Indian.

He and about thirty others who had been living there, what Trout called \u201csacred cattle,\u201d were carted off in a black school bus and deposited in the shelter way-the-hell-and-gone up on West 155th Street.\nThe Museum of the American Indian had moved the detritus of overwhelmed aborigines, and dioramas of how they lived before the shit hit the fan, into a safer neighborhood downtown, five years before Trout arrived.\nHe was eighty-four years old now, having passed another milestone on November 11th, 2000.

And Marco and his wife brought their son over to our house on the night before Mother\u2019s Day, and the whole family cried like babies. They didn\u2019t care who saw them do it.\nThey were right to cry, too, as things turned out. Their son Julio would be killed in Germany.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAt dawn on Mother\u2019s Day, while Mother was still asleep, Father and Felix and I went out to the rifle range of the Midland County Rod and Gun Club, as we had done at least a hundred times before. It was a Sunday-morning ritual, this discharging of firearms. Although I was only twelve, I had fired rifles and pistols and shotguns of every kind. And there were plenty of other fathers and sons, blazing away and blazing away.\nPolice Chief Francis X. Morissey was there, I remember, with Bucky, his son. Morissey was one of the bunch who had been goose-hunting with Father and John Fortune back in 1916, when old August Gunther disappeared. Only recently have I learned that it was Morissey who killed old Gunther. He accidentally discharged a ten-gauge shotgun about a foot from Gunther\u2019s head.\nThere was no head left.\nSo Father and the rest, in order to keep Morissey\u2019s life from being ruined by an accident that could have happened to anyone, launched Gunther\u2019s body for a voyage down Sugar Creek.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOn the morning of Mother\u2019s Day, Father and Felix and I didn\u2019t have any exotic weapons along. Since Felix was headed for battle, seemingly, we brought only the Springfield .30-06. The Springfield was no longer the standard American infantry weapon.

don\u2019t believe it really happened,\u201d Hope objected.\n\u201cMakes no difference whether it really did or not,\u201d said the General, \u201cjust as long as it\u2019s logical. So . . .\u201d\nHaley\u2019s hopes for a reprieve twitched and died. The omens had seemed good. The menace of Mr. Banghart had made the General almost genial at times. Hope had suggested that it was the only type of problem that permitted him to use to the fullest his stock solution to every problem. \u201cWorships firepower,\u201d she said.\nHowever, weeks had passed, and Mr. Banghart had not sailed into the General\u2019s sights like a clay pigeon. Neither was he apprehended by the police. Law-enforcement officers in the town near Ardennes Farm took to crediting him with unsolved purse-snatchings and burglaries, but his face was seen in police circulars and nowhere else. The situation spelled moments of depression for the General, who would surmise gloomily that Banghart had fled the country or had been among the dozens of unidentified bums killed every month while hopping freight trains.\nUnder the General\u2019s urging, the State Police withdrew their sentinel. A visiting neighbor laughed himself hoarse over the jungle of weapons in the sunroom, and on the following morning the bulletin board informed Haley that he was to put a light coat of oil on all of the guns and return them, save two, to their racks. The General kept out the single-shot duck gun, which he leaned against the frame of the back door, and he carried a .45-caliber service revolver slung on his belt whenever he left the farmhouse.\n\u201cYou people keep away from this shotgun unless you absolutely have to use it,\u201d he ordered. \u201cLeave Banghart to me. I\u2019d feel safer locked in a phone booth with him than I would knowing one of you was on the prowl with this cannon. Guns and women can make an atom bombing look like an ice-cream social,\u201d he declared. \u201cOnly this morning I read a story in the paper about a woman who shot her husband, the cat, and the water-softener because she thought she heard suspicious noises downstairs.\u201d Haley searched the paper for this fascinating item, but he was unable to find anything like it.\nOn the afternoon of the same day, Haley came upon the General unexpectedly to find him standing before the closed door of the corncrib. He had his pistol in hand, cocked and pointed at the door. \u201cAll right, Banghart,\u201d he was saying, \u201cI\u2019ll give you three to come out. One\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the shotgun,\u201d cried Haley.\nThe General looked at him quickly, with a trifle of embarrassment, Haley thought. With a gesture that seemed perfectly reasonable at the time, the General motioned for Haley to be deathly still. \u201cAll right, Banghart, come out or it\u2019s curtains,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo.\u201d He paused a long while.

They set up the board in the sewing room, a small chamber which opened onto the hallway in the rear of the house, next to the kitchen. Haley closed the door of the room, insulating it from the noise of the General\u2019s favorite news commentator, and of Annie\u2019s stacking the dishes in the sink.\nAs they played, their conversation centered upon the game, which Haley was winning. He adored Hope\u2019s every word and gesture; and Hope, apparently aware of his loving stare and unprotesting, smiled whenever their eyes met.\n\u201cGoody!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cnow I\u2019ve got a king at last. I\u2019ll give you a hard time now.\u201d She reached across the board to cap the piece that had made its way to the last row on Haley\u2019s side. Haley dropped his hand over hers and gave it a fervent squeeze.\nHope\u2019s eyes widened, more with a look of surprise than with the ecstasy Haley had daydreamed himself into expecting. \u201cHow nice,\u201d she said vaguely. \u201cHow very nice. Now can I have my hand back?\u201d\n\u201cI love you, Hope,\u201d said Haley, his face hot beneath his sunburn.\nHope looked alarmed, and tugged to free her hand, but Haley only clasped it more tightly. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said finally. Her hand was limp and unresponsive. Haley half arose. \u201cJust as I love Annie and Kitty and the General,\u201d she added quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re just like one of the family.\u201d\n\u201cNot that kind of love,\u201d he said weakly. He freed her hand.\n\u201cI guess I know what you meant,\u201d she said, giving him a look of pity. \u201cAnd I feel very flattered and honored that you should feel that way. I\u2019m fond of you, too, Haley. But we\u2019re awfully young to be thinking about being in love, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re older than Romeo and Juliet,\u201d said Haley peevishly.\n\u201cWell, then, we\u2019re just not made for each other, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s no insult to say that. Some people are made for each other, some aren\u2019t.\u201d She frowned, apparently at the profundity of this universal law. \u201cWe aren\u2019t, and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d",

I certainly am,\u201d said Billy Pilgrim.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe went home for a nap after lunch. He was under doctor\u2019s orders to take a nap every day. The doctor hoped that this would relieve a complaint that Billy had: Every so often, for no apparent reason, Billy Pilgrim would find himself weeping. Nobody had ever caught Billy doing it. Only the doctor knew. It was an extremely quiet thing Billy did, and not very moist.\nBilly owned a lovely Georgian home in Ilium. He was rich as Croesus, something he had never expected to be, not in a million years. He had five other optometrists working for him in the shopping plaza location, and netted over sixty thousand dollars a year. In addition, he owned a fifth of the new Holiday Inn out on Route 54, and half of three Tastee-Freeze stands. Tastee-Freeze was a sort of frozen custard. It gave all the pleasure that ice cream could give, without the stiffness and bitter coldness of ice cream.\nBilly\u2019s home was empty. His daughter Barbara was about to get married, and she and his wife had gone downtown to pick out patterns for her crystal and silverware. There was a note saying so on the kitchen table. There were no servants. People just weren\u2019t interested in careers in domestic service anymore. There wasn\u2019t a dog, either.\nThere used to be a dog named Spot, but he died. So it goes. Billy had liked Spot a lot, and Spot had liked him.\nBilly went up the carpeted stairway and into his and his wife\u2019s bedroom. The room had flowered wallpaper. There was a double bed with a clock-radio on a table beside it. Also on the table were controls for the electric blanket, and a switch to turn on a gentle vibrator which was bolted to the springs of the box mattress. The trade name of the vibrator was \u201cMagic Fingers.\u201d The vibrator was the doctor\u2019s idea, too.\nBilly took off his tri-focals and his coat and his necktie and his shoes, and he closed the venetian blinds and then the drapes, and he lay down on the outside of the coverlet. But sleep would not come. Tears came instead. They seeped. Billy turned on the Magic Fingers, and he was jiggled as he wept.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe doorchimes rang.

barrier of thermodynamics, or pile of shit, if you like, I still wanted to be respected as a person who thought scientifically, who loved the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It was obvious that only a pseudoscience was a possibility for me. Ideally, I thought, it should be a pseudoscience socially superior to astrology, meteorology, hairdressing, economics, or embalming.\nThe two most prominent such, then as now, were psychoanalysis and cultural anthropology. Both were based, then as now, on what had regularly sent innocent persons to the electric chair or the hot squat, which is human testimony, which is blah-blah-blah. I chose cultural anthropology. The result now stands before you.\nMuch has been written about the effects on institutions of higher learning of the sudden influx of veterans after my war. One thing it did was bamboozle many teachers whose authority and glamour was based on their having seen a lot more of life and the world than their students had. In seminars I would occasionally try to talk about something I had observed about human beings while a soldier, as a prisoner of war, as a family man. I had a wife and kid then. This turned out to be very bad manners, like coming to a crap game with loaded dice. No fair.\nAlso: We were so innocent.\nIn retrospect, my trying to become a member of the Anthropology Department was like visiting a kibbutz, a kibbutz as described by Bruno Bettelheim in The Children of the Dream. We returning veterans were mildly interesting strangers to be treated politely, with our understanding and theirs that we would soon go away again. And we did.\nAt about that time there appeared in The New Yorker a series of stories by Ludwig Bemelmans about a busboy who assisted a waiter in a grand hotel in Paris. The waiter was named Mespoulets, \u201cmy little chickens.\u201d Mespoulets\u2019s specialty was serving persons the management didn\u2019t want to come back again.\nEvery academic department has a sort of Mespoulets, I think. We certainly had one in the Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa when I taught there. The Mespoulets in the Anthropology Department in my time I will call Dr. Z, who is no longer among the living.\nDr. Z was lacking in the charm and stage presence fundamental to the reputation of a great cultural anthropologist. He was also having trouble getting published. So he was made thesis advisor for those of us the department\u2019s stars did not care to work with. He also gave a course in the summertime, when the rest of the department was on vacation or on a dig or whatever. The course could be about anything, since its real purpose was to entitle returning veterans to continue to receive living allowances from a grateful government. In order to make ends meet, I was working as a police reporter for the Chicago City News Bureau, practicing what might nowadays be called \u201curban anthropology.\u201d\nBecoming one of Dr. Z\u2019s little chickens was one of the most fortunate things which ever happened to me, second only, perhaps, to my having been in Dresden when it was firebombed. He died a long time ago now, but many of his ideas live on with me. He died several years after I left. He was a suicide. He had great big ideas about science, about art, about religion, about evolution, and on and on, which he expressed in his cockamamie summer course.

top financial people in Ecuador that he was prepared to transfer instantly to any designated fiduciary in Ecuador fifty million American dollars, still as good as gold. Most of the supposed wealth held by American banks at that point had become so wholly imaginary, so weightless and impalpable, that any amount of it could be transferred instantly to Ecuador, or anyplace else capable of receiving a written message by wire or radio.\n*MacIntosh was waiting to hear from Quito what properties Ecuadorians would be willing to put into the names of himself, his daughter, and the Hiroguchis, also instantly, in exchange for such a sum.\nIt wasn\u2019t even going to be his own money. He had arranged to borrow it, whatever it was, from the Chase Manhattan Bank. They found it somewhere, whatever it was, to loan to him.\nYes, and if the deal went through, Ecuador could wire or radio pieces of the mirage to fertile countries and get real food in return.\nAnd the people would eat up all the food, gobble, gobble, yum, yum, and it would become nothing but excrement and memories. What then for little Ecuador?\n*MacIntosh\u2019s call was supposed to come at five-thirty on the dot. He had half an hour more to wait and he ordered two rare filet mignons with all the trimmings from room service. There were still plenty of good things to eat at the El Dorado, hoarded for arriving passengers for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century,\u201d and especially for Mrs. Onassis. Soldiers at that moment were stringing barbed wire at a distance of one block in every direction around the hotel\u2014to protect the food.\nThe same thing was happening at the waterfront. Barbed wire was being strung around the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, which, as everyone in Guayaquil knew, had been provisioned to serve three gourmet meals a day, no two alike, for fourteen days\u2014to one hundred passengers. A person looking at the beautiful ship, and capable of doing a little arithmetic, might have had this thought: \u201cI am so hungry, and my wife and children are so hungry, and my mother and father are so hungry\u2014and there are forty-two hundred delicious meals in there.\u201d\nThe man who brought the two filet mignon suppers to Selena\u2019s room had made such calculations, and carried in his big brain an inventory of the good things to eat in the hotel\u2019s larder as well. He himself wasn\u2019t hungry yet, since the hotel staff was still being fed. His family, a small one by Ecuadorian standards, consisting of a pregnant wife, her mother, his father, and an orphaned nephew he was raising, were also well enough fed so far. Like all the other employees, he had been stealing food from the hotel for his family.\nThis was Jes\u00fas Ortiz, the young Inca bartender who had recently been serving James Wait downstairs. He had been pressed into service as a room waiter by *Siegfried von Kleist, the manager, who himself had taken over as bartender. The hotel was suddenly short-handed. The two regular room-service waiters seemed to have disappeared. That might be all right, that they had disappeared, since no large volume of room service had been expected. They might be asleep somewhere.\nSo Ortiz had those two steaks for his big brain to think about in the kitchen, and then in the elevator, and then in the corridor outside Selena\u2019s room. The hotel\u2019s employees were not eating and stealing food that good. They were generally proud of that. They were still saving the best for what they spoke of as \u201cSe\u00f1ora Kennedy,\u201d actually Mrs. Onassis, which was their collective term for all the famous and rich and powerful people who were still supposed to be coming.", 0.21571914480077747], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["telegram", 0.034482758620689655], ["wasn", 0.034482758620689655], ["friend", 0.034482758620689655], ["eyes", 0.034482758620689655], ["comment", 0.017241379310344827], ["marilee", 0.017241379310344827], ["letters", 0.017241379310344827], ["family", 0.017241379310344827], ["people", 0.017241379310344827], ["suddenly", 0.017241379310344827], ["abstract", 0.017241379310344827], ["pa", 0.017241379310344827], ["years", 0.017241379310344827], ["will", 0.017241379310344827], ["addressed", 0.017241379310344827], ["art", 0.017241379310344827], ["happen", 0.017241379310344827], ["fine", 0.017241379310344827], ["message", 0.017241379310344827], ["best", 0.017241379310344827], ["lessons", 0.017241379310344827], ["superior", 0.017241379310344827], ["guess", 0.017241379310344827], ["opened", 0.017241379310344827], ["pictures", 0.017241379310344827], ["began", 0.017241379310344827], ["father", 0.017241379310344827], ["paint", 0.017241379310344827], ["pollock", 0.017241379310344827], ["rothko", 0.017241379310344827], ["expressionists", 0.017241379310344827], ["christmas", 0.017241379310344827], ["today", 0.017241379310344827], ["board", 0.017241379310344827], ["transportation", 0.017241379310344827], ["closest", 0.017241379310344827], ["apprentice", 0.017241379310344827], ["free", 0.017241379310344827], ["1932", 0.017241379310344827], ["modest", 0.017241379310344827], ["arrived", 0.017241379310344827], ["terry", 0.017241379310344827], ["kitchen", 0.017241379310344827], ["received", 0.017241379310344827], ["bored", 0.017241379310344827], ["creeps", 0.017241379310344827], ["room", 0.017241379310344827], ["looked", 0.017241379310344827], ["thing", 0.017241379310344827], ["audience", 0.017241379310344827], ["greatest", 0.017241379310344827], ["unread", 0.017241379310344827], ["lying", 0.017241379310344827], ["allowance", 0.017241379310344827]], "sentiment": ["It gave me the creeps, actually, because I would look into his eyes, and there wasn\u2019t anybody home anymore.\nI would see the same thing happen to Terry Kitchen years later.

American public be so stupid? People still believe that Bush was elected, that he cares about us and has some idea of what he is doing. How can we \u201csave\u201d people by killing them and destroying their country? How can we strike first on the belief that we will soon be attacked? No sense, no reason, no moral grounds have gotten through to him. He is nothing but a moron puppet leading us all over the precipice. Why can\u2019t people see that the military dictator in the White House has no clothes?\nI told him that if he doubted that we are demons in Hell, he should read The Mysterious Stranger, which Mark Twain wrote in 1898, long before the First World War (1914\u20131918). In the title story he proves to his own grim satisfaction, and to mine as well, that Satan and not God created the planet earth and \u201cthe damned human race.\u201d If you doubt that, read your morning paper. Never mind what paper. Never mind what date.\n11\nNow then, I have some good news for you and some bad news. The bad news is that the Martians have landed in New York City and are staying at the Waldorf Astoria. The good news is that they only eat homeless men, women, and children of all colors, and they pee gasoline.\nPut that pee in a Ferrari, and you can go a hundred miles an hour. Put some in an airplane, and you can go as fast as a bullet and drop all kinds of crap on Arabs. Put some in a school bus, and it\u2019ll get the kids to and from school. Put some in a fire engine, and it will get firemen to the fire so they can put the fire out. Put some in a Honda, and it\u2019ll get you to work and then back home again.\nAnd wait until you hear what the Martians poop. It\u2019s uranium. Just one of them can light and heat every home and school and church and business in Tacoma.\nBut seriously, if you keep up with current events in the supermarket tabloids, you know that a team of Martian anthropologists has been studying our culture for the past ten years, since our culture is the only one worth a nickel on the whole planet. You can sure forget Brazil and Argentina.\nAnyway, they went home last week, because they knew how terrible global warming was about to become. Their space vehicle, incidentally, wasn\u2019t a flying saucer. It was more like a flying soup tureen. And they\u2019re little all right, only six inches high. But they are not green. They\u2019re mauve.\nAnd their little mauve leader, by way of farewell, said in that teeny-weeny, tanny-wanny, toney little voice of hers that there were two things about American culture no Martian would ever understand.\n\u201cWhat is it,\u201d she squeaked, \u201cwhat can it possibly be about blowjobs and golf?\u201d", -0.036462881090540675], "title": "A Man without a Country"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["real", 0.028368794326241134], ["sun", 0.02127659574468085], ["book", 0.02127659574468085], ["indianapolis", 0.02127659574468085], ["years", 0.014184397163120567], ["late", 0.014184397163120567], ["read", 0.014184397163120567], ["happiest", 0.014184397163120567], ["night", 0.014184397163120567], ["year", 0.014184397163120567], ["hill", 0.014184397163120567], ["ufe", 0.014184397163120567], ["american", 0.014184397163120567], ["family", 0.014184397163120567], ["mine", 0.014184397163120567], ["god", 0.014184397163120567], ["walking", 0.0070921985815602835], ["writings", 0.0070921985815602835], ["caused", 0.0070921985815602835], ["experiments", 0.0070921985815602835], ["questions", 0.0070921985815602835], ["ithaca", 0.0070921985815602835], ["lit", 0.0070921985815602835], ["paris", 0.0070921985815602835], ["1940", 0.0070921985815602835], ["writer", 0.0070921985815602835], ["father", 0.0070921985815602835], ["young", 0.0070921985815602835], ["writing", 0.0070921985815602835], ["flanner", 0.0070921985815602835], ["woman", 0.0070921985815602835], ["kind", 0.0070921985815602835], ["famous", 0.0070921985815602835], ["day", 0.0070921985815602835], ["enemy", 0.0070921985815602835], ["university", 0.0070921985815602835], ["morning", 0.0070921985815602835], ["large", 0.0070921985815602835], ["yorker", 0.0070921985815602835], ["repeating", 0.0070921985815602835], ["loneliness", 0.0070921985815602835], ["wrote", 0.0070921985815602835], ["administration", 0.0070921985815602835], ["mental", 0.0070921985815602835], ["people", 0.0070921985815602835], ["hard", 0.0070921985815602835], ["asleep", 0.0070921985815602835], ["begun", 0.0070921985815602835], ["curious", 0.0070921985815602835], ["depression", 0.0070921985815602835], ["living", 0.0070921985815602835], ["outspoken", 0.0070921985815602835], ["artificial", 0.0070921985815602835], ["mortuaries", 0.0070921985815602835], ["written", 0.0070921985815602835], ["health", 0.0070921985815602835], ["capital", 0.0070921985815602835], ["sorts", 0.0070921985815602835], ["janet", 0.0070921985815602835], ["manufactured", 0.0070921985815602835], ["hours", 0.0070921985815602835], ["surely", 0.0070921985815602835], ["york", 0.0070921985815602835], ["members", 0.0070921985815602835], ["great", 0.0070921985815602835], ["thirty", 0.0070921985815602835], ["institute", 0.0070921985815602835], ["invited", 0.0070921985815602835], ["times", 0.0070921985815602835], ["games", 0.0070921985815602835], ["letters", 0.0070921985815602835], ["primary", 0.0070921985815602835], ["community", 0.0070921985815602835], ["highly", 0.0070921985815602835], ["respectable", 0.0070921985815602835], ["gleaned", 0.0070921985815602835], ["size", 0.0070921985815602835], ["city", 0.0070921985815602835], ["arts", 0.0070921985815602835], ["long", 0.0070921985815602835], ["almighty", 0.0070921985815602835], ["doubt", 0.0070921985815602835], ["war", 0.0070921985815602835], ["life", 0.0070921985815602835], ["families", 0.0070921985815602835], ["supporters", 0.0070921985815602835], ["academy", 0.0070921985815602835], ["gen", 0.0070921985815602835], ["sunrise", 0.0070921985815602835], ["midst", 0.0070921985815602835], ["admiration", 0.0070921985815602835], ["bed", 0.0070921985815602835], ["will", 0.0070921985815602835], ["pneumonia", 0.0070921985815602835], ["weren", 0.0070921985815602835], ["teachers", 0.0070921985815602835], ["newspaper", 0.0070921985815602835], ["called", 0.0070921985815602835], ["trudged", 0.0070921985815602835], ["best", 0.0070921985815602835], ["agnostic", 0.0070921985815602835], ["helped", 0.0070921985815602835], ["alike", 0.0070921985815602835], ["42", 0.0070921985815602835], ["41", 0.0070921985815602835], ["member", 0.0070921985815602835], ["arguments", 0.0070921985815602835], ["intelligent", 0.0070921985815602835], ["harding", 0.0070921985815602835], ["students", 0.0070921985815602835], ["knew", 0.0070921985815602835], ["designed", 0.0070921985815602835], ["freshman", 0.0070921985815602835], ["approved", 0.0070921985815602835], ["thorax", 0.0070921985815602835], ["correspondent", 0.0070921985815602835], ["remember", 0.0070921985815602835], ["disease", 0.0070921985815602835], ["person", 0.0070921985815602835], ["playing", 0.0070921985815602835]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI found a family here at the Sun, or I no doubt would have invited pneumonia into my thorax during my freshman year.

The Merchants\u2019 Trust Company of Cape Cod was his financial guardian. His uncle Charley Brewer was the guardian of his person. And Robert was not only going to Cape Cod to honeymoon. He was going to take full control of his inheritance as well. His wedding day was also his twenty-first birthday, and the bank\u2019s financial guardianship was legally at an end.\nRobert was in a Limbo of his own. He wasn\u2019t full of talk.

The dedication read, \"For Eliot Rosewater, my compassionate turquoise.\" And under that was another quotation from Donne:\nA compassionate turquoise which doth tell By looking pale, the wearer is not well.\nA covering letter from Ulm explained that the book was going to be published by Palindrome Press in time for Christmas, and was going to be a joint selection, along with The Cradle of Erotica, of a major book club.\nYou have no doubt forgotten me, Compassionate Turquoise, the letter said in part. The Arthur Garvey Ulm you knew was a man well worth forgetting. What a coward he was, and what a fool he was to think he was a poet! And what a long, long time it took him to understand exactly how generous and kind your cruelty was! How much you managed to tell me about what was wrong with me, and what I should do about it, and how few words you used! Here then (fourteen years later) are eight hundred pages of prose by me. They could not have been created by me without you, and I do not mean your money. (Money is shit, which is one of the things I have tried to say in the book.) I mean your insistence that the truth be told about this sick, sick society of ours, and that the words for the telling could be found on the walls of restrooms.\nEliot couldn't remember who Arthur Garvey Ulm was, and so was even further from knowing what advice he might have given the man. The clues Ulm offered were so nebulous. Eliot was pleased that he had given someone useful advice, was thrilled even, when Ulm declared:\n\"Let them shoot me, let them hang me, but I have told the truth. The gnashing of the teeth of the Pharisees, Madison Avenue phonies and Philistines will be music to my ears. With your divine assistance, I have let the Djin of truth about them out of the bottle, and they will never, never, never ever get it back in!\"\nEliot began to read avidly the truths Ulm expected to get killed for telling:\n\"CHAPTER ONE\n\"I twisted her arm until she opened her legs, and she gave a little scream, half joy, half pain (how do you figure a woman?), as I rammed the old avenger home.\"", 0.003124039938556062], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["larkin", 0.041666666666666664], ["day", 0.025], ["jesus", 0.025], ["friend", 0.025], ["hell", 0.016666666666666666], ["save", 0.016666666666666666], ["virgil", 0.016666666666666666], ["emil", 0.016666666666666666], ["greathouse", 0.016666666666666666], ["man", 0.016666666666666666], ["person", 0.016666666666666666], ["help", 0.008333333333333333], ["quoted", 0.008333333333333333], ["years", 0.008333333333333333], ["rough", 0.008333333333333333], ["conclude", 0.008333333333333333], ["killed", 0.008333333333333333], ["aviv", 0.008333333333333333], ["thieves", 0.008333333333333333], ["prison", 0.008333333333333333], ["presbyterian", 0.008333333333333333], ["good", 0.008333333333333333], ["wished", 0.008333333333333333], ["dr", 0.008333333333333333], ["sinners", 0.008333333333333333], ["school", 0.008333333333333333], ["sentimental", 0.008333333333333333], ["prize", 0.008333333333333333], ["brother", 0.008333333333333333], ["persisted", 0.008333333333333333], ["car", 0.008333333333333333], ["notorious", 0.008333333333333333], ["speculation", 0.008333333333333333], ["shapiro", 0.008333333333333333], ["tel", 0.008333333333333333], ["quaker", 0.008333333333333333], ["reunion", 0.008333333333333333], ["harassment", 0.008333333333333333], ["best", 0.008333333333333333], ["enemies", 0.008333333333333333], ["christ", 0.008333333333333333], ["god", 0.008333333333333333], ["dominated", 0.008333333333333333], ["told", 0.008333333333333333], ["eternal", 0.008333333333333333], ["surely", 0.008333333333333333], ["days", 0.008333333333333333], ["thing", 0.008333333333333333], ["wiretaps", 0.008333333333333333], ["asked", 0.008333333333333333], ["breakfasts", 0.008333333333333333], ["named", 0.008333333333333333], ["depart", 0.008333333333333333], ["cocked", 0.008333333333333333], ["revenue", 0.008333333333333333], ["primary", 0.008333333333333333], ["cursed", 0.008333333333333333], ["thick", 0.008333333333333333], ["devil", 0.008333333333333333], ["service", 0.008333333333333333], ["illegal", 0.008333333333333333], ["appall", 0.008333333333333333], ["long", 0.008333333333333333], ["insult", 0.008333333333333333], ["saint", 0.008333333333333333], ["inspiration", 0.008333333333333333], ["harrowing", 0.008333333333333333], ["war", 0.008333333333333333], ["head", 0.008333333333333333], ["fire", 0.008333333333333333], ["cruelty", 0.008333333333333333], ["burglaries", 0.008333333333333333], ["admiration", 0.008333333333333333], ["ben", 0.008333333333333333], ["angels", 0.008333333333333333], ["flip", 0.008333333333333333], ["will", 0.008333333333333333], ["matter", 0.008333333333333333], ["prospect", 0.008333333333333333], ["crazy", 0.008333333333333333], ["remained", 0.008333333333333333], ["turned", 0.008333333333333333], ["israel", 0.008333333333333333], ["heard", 0.008333333333333333], ["promised", 0.008333333333333333], ["prayer", 0.008333333333333333], ["tough", 0.008333333333333333], ["matthew", 0.008333333333333333], ["internal", 0.008333333333333333], ["babies", 0.008333333333333333], ["stepped", 0.008333333333333333], ["mock", 0.008333333333333333], ["felt", 0.008333333333333333], ["prepared", 0.008333333333333333], ["judgment", 0.008333333333333333], ["christians", 0.008333333333333333], ["ago", 0.008333333333333333], ["honor", 0.008333333333333333], ["thought", 0.008333333333333333], ["time", 0.008333333333333333], ["flops", 0.008333333333333333], ["appalled", 0.008333333333333333], ["left", 0.008333333333333333]], "sentiment": ["Emil Larkin, the Presbyterian, and Virgil Greathouse, the Quaker, had been thick as thieves back in the good old days. They had not only dominated the burglaries and the illegal wiretaps and the harassment of enemies by the Internal Revenue Service and so on, but the prayer breakfasts, as well. So I asked Larkin now how he felt about the reunion in prospect.\n\u201cVirgil Greathouse is no more and no less my brother than you or any other man,\u201d he said. \u201cI will try to save him from hell, just as I am now trying to save you from hell.\u201d He then quoted the harrowing thing that Jesus, according to Saint Matthew, had promised to say in the Person of God to sinners on Judgment Day.\nThis is it: \u201cDepart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.\u201d\nThese words appalled me then, and they appall me now. They are surely the inspiration for the notorious cruelty of Christians.\n\u201cJesus may have said that,\u201d I told Larkin, \u201cbut it is so unlike most of what else He said that I have to conclude that He was slightly crazy that day.\u201d\nLarkin stepped back and he cocked his head in mock admiration. \u201cI have seen some rough-tough babies in my time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you really take the prize. You\u2019ve turned every friend you ever had against you, with all your flip-flops through the years, and now you insult that last Person who still might be willing to help you, who is Jesus Christ.\u201d\nI said nothing.

They were forever suggesting that teams be formed and games be played as a method for building morale in the Eastern Division\u2019s family.\n\u201cJust you, or all four of you?\u201d said Paul. He was in fact the club checker champion, though there had never been any sort of official playoff. No one could beat him, and, wearily as often as not, he had had to prove his invincibility to each new group of engineers\u2014like these four. It was a custom, and the close little society on the north side of the river seemed to feel the need of customs, of private jokes, of building up social characteristics to distinguish themselves\u2014in their own eyes\u2014from the rest of society. The checker game of the new engineers with Paul was one of the hoariest traditions, now in its seventh year.\n\u201cMe, mostly,\u201d said Berringer. \u201cBut all of us, in a way.\u201d The others laughed like conspirators. Apparently something special had been cooked up, and one or two of the older engineers seemed to be sharing in the high expectations.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Paul good-humoredly; \u201cif there were ten of you, and each one blowing cigar smoke in my face, I\u2019d still win.\u201d\nThe four parted to let Paul, Anita, and the two guests of honor get to the table.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Anita, studying the place cards at the head of the table, \u201cthere\u2019s been a mistake.\u201d She picked up the card to her left, wadded it up, and handed it to Paul. She moved another card into the vacant position and sat down, flanked by Kroner and Baer. She called a waiter to take away the now extra place setting. Paul looked at the card and saw it was Finnerty\u2019s.\nThe assemblage was a practical, earthy one, and the shrimp cocktails, consomm\u00e9, creamed chicken, peas, and mashed potatoes were enjoyed for their own sake. There was little talk, and much pantomimed savoring and beaming to show the hostess that everything tasted first rate.\nPeriodically, Kroner would comment on this dish or that, and he would be echoed by Baer, and then by nods about the table. Once, an argument broke out in loud whispers at the far end of the table, among the four youngsters who had challenged Paul to the checker game. When all eyes turned in their direction, they shut up. Berringer frowned, sketched a diagram of some sort on a napkin, and thrust it at the other three. One of them made a slight correction and handed it back.

They were welded to rigid shafts. Their clappers had been removed. They were struck instead by bolts thrust by electricity from Niagara Falls. Their singing could be stopped in an instant by brakes lined with neoprene.\nThe room in which a dozen or more learning-disabled bell-pullers used to be zonked out of their skulls by hellishly loud cacophony contained a 3-octave keyboard against 1 wall. The holes for the ropes in the ceiling had been plugged and plastered over.\nNothing works up there anymore. The room with the keyboard and the belfry above were riddled by bullets and also bazooka shells fired by escaped convicts down below after a sniper up among the bells shot and killed 11 of them, and wounded 15 more. The sniper was the President of Tarkington College. Even though he was dead when the convicts got to him, they were so outraged that they crucified him in the loft of the stable where the students used to keep their horses, at the foot of Musket Mountain.\nSo a President of Tarkington, my mentor Sam Wakefield, blew his brains out with a Colt .45. And his successor, although he couldn\u2019t feel anything, was crucified.\nOne would have to say that that was extra-heavy history.\nAS FOR LIGHT history: The no longer useful clappers of the bells were hung in order of size, but unlabeled, on the wall of the foyer of this library, above the perpetual-motion machines. So it became a college tradition for upperclasspersons to tell incoming freshmen that the clappers were the petrified penises of different mammals. The biggest clapper, which had once belonged to Beelzebub, the biggest bell, was said to be the penis of none other than Moby Dick, the Great White Whale.\nMany of the freshmen believed it, and were watched to see how long they went on believing it, just as they had been watched when they were little, no doubt, to see how long they would go on believing in the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus.\nVIETNAM.\nMOST OF THE letters to The Musketeer protesting the modernization of the Lutz Carillon are from people who had somehow hung on to the wealth and power they had been born to. One, though, is from a man who admitted that he was in prison for fraud, and that he had ruined his life and that of his family with his twin addictions to alcohol and gambling.
