"sentiment": ["That telephone call this morning was a painful but a necessary one. I enclose the letter I read to you over the phone, so the central issue of our talk will not become hopelessly lost in overly emotional memories.\nI have since spoken to several respected literary agents, without mentioning your name, and to the Authors Guild, too. In each case, I merely asked what the custom was when an agent no longer wished or was no longer able to function as an author\u2019s full-time, day-after-day representative in the marketplace.\n(Don did not put me up to this, incidentally. I was showing a balance sheet to bankers from Morgan Guaranty, and they were puzzled by how much I paid for representation, and they asked what services were performed for such fees.)\nI was told by the literary agents that it was customary for retiring agents to make deals with responsible successors, successors satisfactory to the authors involved. Thus did the commissions continue to pay for the alert and energetic and supportive services of some sort of office staff. There were a few famous instances, they said, when an agent died unexpectedly, before he could arrange for continuity in representation. Thus did the authors fall into the hands of heirs who knew nothing about the agency business or the author, but were legally entitled to commissions in perpetuity anyway.\nI was told by the Authors Guild that they have published no position papers on what happens when an agent retires without setting up a successor, but that they were just starting to work up such a document. Continuing commissions were an accepted practice, they said, because continuing services were surely implied.\nYou say that you have not retired, but I tell you as your client that you have felt retired to me. I can\u2019t use what you are offering out there. And will I eventually be willed to someone even less active? If so, I would like to know about it.\nDo you realize that I cannot now get representation by an active agent for ten per cent unless I write another book? How many authors of my maturity can have a real agency, only if one writes more books? Or pay double commissions?\nThe Authors Guild told me, incidentally, about the vaguely similar situation in which M.C.A. retired from the agency business. M.C.A. was still legally entitled, like you, to commissions from past deals for authors, which used to go into services to authors and, of course, profit. With no services to perform any more, M.C.A. might have enjoyed those commissions from the past as pure profit. But M.C.A. spared their authors the prospect of receiving no more services, unless, of course, the authors turned out more work, by making a deal with I.C.M. Each author got the agent he wanted at I.C.M., and services were uninterrupted. Nobody had to pay double commissions to get good help.\nLet\u2019s keep emotion out of this as much as we can. I am correctly interested in what would be fair and business-like for both of us.\nYours truly,", 0.12846560846560848], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["harold", 0.08695652173913043], ["penelope", 0.08695652173913043], ["man", 0.08695652173913043], ["woodly", 0.08695652173913043], ["closes", 0.043478260869565216], ["police", 0.043478260869565216], ["door", 0.043478260869565216], ["backs", 0.043478260869565216], ["holds", 0.043478260869565216], ["telephone", 0.043478260869565216], ["drifts", 0.043478260869565216], ["frighteningly", 0.043478260869565216], ["phone", 0.043478260869565216], ["going", 0.043478260869565216], ["call", 0.043478260869565216], ["rifle", 0.043478260869565216], ["moving", 0.043478260869565216], ["paul", 0.043478260869565216], ["agree", 0.043478260869565216]], "sentiment": ["PENELOPE\n(moving to the telephone) I'm going to call the police.\nHAROLD\n(frighteningly)\nDon't!\nWOODLY\nI agree.\nWOODLY closes the door.
