And from a flange on the central shaft in the cabin hung a black brassi\u00e8re.\nBeatrice gathered up the bottles and beer cans. She dropped them out the door.

still prowling around the room, smiling, his eyes now closed all the way. His heel caught in a lamp cord, and he went sprawling on the hearth, his head in the ashes. \"Hi-ho, everybody,\" he said, his eyes still closed. \"Bunged my head on an andiron.\" He stayed there, giggling occasionally.\n\"The doorbell\u2019s been ringing for a while,\" Susan said. \"I don\u2019t suppose it means anything.\"\n\"Come in, come in,\" I shouted. This somehow struck everyone as terribly funny. We all laughed uproariously, including Fred, whose guffaws blew up little gray clouds from the ashpit.\nA small, very serious old man in white had let himself in, and was now standing in the vestibule, looking at us with alarm. \"Milkman,\" he said uncertainly. He held out a slip of paper to Marion. \"I can\u2019t read the last line in your note,\" he said. \"What\u2019s that say about cottage cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese ...\" His voice trailed off as he settled, tailor-fashion, to the floor beside Marion. After he\u2019d been silent for perhaps three quarters of an hour, a look of concern crossed his face. \"Well,\" he said apathetically, \"I can only stay for a minute. My truck\u2019s parked out on the shoulder, kind of blocking things.\" He started to stand. Lew gave the volume knob on the euphio a twist. The milkman wilted to the floor.\n\"Aaaaaaaaaaah,\" said everybody.\n\"Good day to be indoors,\" the milkman said. \"Radio says we\u2019ll catch the tail end of the Atlantic hurricane.\"\n\"Let \u2019er come,\" I said. \"I\u2019ve got my car parked under a big, dead tree.\" It seemed to make sense. Nobody took exception to it. I lapsed back into a warm fog of silence and thought of nothing whatsoever. These lapses seemed to last for a matter of seconds before they were interrupted by conversation of newcomers. Looking back, I see now that the lapses were rarely less than six hours.\nI was snapped out of one, I recall, by a repetition of the doorbell\u2019s ringing. \"I said come in,\" I mumbled.\n\"And I did,\" the milkman mumbled.\nThe door swung open, and a state trooper glared in at us. \"Who the hell\u2019s got his milk truck out there blocking the road?\" he demanded. He spotted the milkman. \"Aha! Don\u2019t you know somebody could get killed, coming around a blind curve into that thing?\" He yawned, and his ferocious expression gave way to an affectionate smile. \"It\u2019s so damn\u2019 unlikely,\" he said, \"I don\u2019t know why I ever brought it up.\" He sat down by Eddie. \"Hey, kid\u2014like guns?\" He took his revolver from its holster. \"Look\u2014just like Hoppy\u2019s.\"", 0.024331275720164608], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["mark", 0.06382978723404255], ["charley", 0.04964539007092199], ["earl", 0.0425531914893617], ["father", 0.028368794326241134], ["dog", 0.028368794326241134], ["paper", 0.02127659574468085], ["house", 0.02127659574468085], ["wasn", 0.02127659574468085], ["fight", 0.02127659574468085], ["thinking", 0.014184397163120567], ["window", 0.014184397163120567], ["wednesday", 0.014184397163120567], ["tired", 0.014184397163120567], ["delivered", 0.014184397163120567], ["estelle", 0.014184397163120567], ["eyes", 0.014184397163120567], ["hedlund", 0.014184397163120567], ["true", 0.014184397163120567], ["inside", 0.014184397163120567], ["stories", 0.014184397163120567], ["ready", 0.014184397163120567], ["chapters", 0.0070921985815602835], ["sleet", 0.0070921985815602835], ["held", 0.0070921985815602835], ["kill", 0.0070921985815602835], ["chair", 0.0070921985815602835], ["satan", 0.0070921985815602835], ["hope", 0.0070921985815602835], ["wouldn", 0.0070921985815602835], ["good", 0.0070921985815602835], ["read", 0.0070921985815602835], ["showing", 0.0070921985815602835], ["game", 0.0070921985815602835], ["locked", 0.0070921985815602835], ["minute", 0.0070921985815602835], ["windowpane", 0.0070921985815602835], ["history", 0.0070921985815602835], ["leaned", 0.0070921985815602835], ["truth", 0.0070921985815602835], ["heartsick", 0.0070921985815602835], ["financial", 0.0070921985815602835], ["fair", 0.0070921985815602835], ["village", 0.0070921985815602835], ["understood", 0.0070921985815602835], ["sneaked", 0.0070921985815602835], ["year", 0.0070921985815602835], ["close", 0.0070921985815602835], ["opened", 0.0070921985815602835], ["ways", 0.0070921985815602835], ["providence", 0.0070921985815602835], ["hill", 0.0070921985815602835], ["closed", 0.0070921985815602835], ["joy", 0.0070921985815602835], ["figured", 0.0070921985815602835], ["climbed", 0.0070921985815602835], ["howes", 0.0070921985815602835], ["yelled", 0.0070921985815602835], ["honor", 0.0070921985815602835], ["road", 0.0070921985815602835], ["feet", 0.0070921985815602835], ["drove", 0.0070921985815602835], ["open", 0.0070921985815602835], ["olds", 0.0070921985815602835], ["git", 0.0070921985815602835], ["ten", 0.0070921985815602835], ["caught", 0.0070921985815602835], ["time", 0.0070921985815602835], ["happy", 0.0070921985815602835], ["delivery", 0.0070921985815602835], ["catch", 0.0070921985815602835], ["reflection", 0.0070921985815602835], ["word", 0.0070921985815602835], ["car", 0.0070921985815602835], ["weren", 0.0070921985815602835], ["newspaper", 0.0070921985815602835], ["proof", 0.0070921985815602835], ["patrol", 0.0070921985815602835], ["scruff", 0.0070921985815602835], ["chase", 0.0070921985815602835], ["grown", 0.0070921985815602835], ["lie", 0.0070921985815602835], ["alibi", 0.0070921985815602835], ["things", 0.0070921985815602835], ["glorious", 0.0070921985815602835], ["tight", 0.0070921985815602835], ["build", 0.0070921985815602835], ["answer", 0.0070921985815602835], ["nice", 0.0070921985815602835], ["knew", 0.0070921985815602835], ["mouth", 0.0070921985815602835], ["man", 0.0070921985815602835], ["neck", 0.0070921985815602835], ["thought", 0.0070921985815602835], ["fact", 0.0070921985815602835], ["teeth", 0.0070921985815602835], ["lying", 0.0070921985815602835]], "sentiment": ["The dog didn\u2019t chase him this time. Satan understood that Mark wasn\u2019t fair game.\n\u201cNow you git, too,\u201d Earl said to Charley.\nCharley was so heartsick about Mark, he leaned against Earl\u2019s house and closed his eyes for a minute. He opened his eyes and saw his reflection in a windowpane. He saw a tired old man, and he figured he\u2019d grown old and tired trying to make the world be what ten-year-olds thought it was.\nAnd then he saw the newspaper lying on the chair just inside the window, locked up nice and tight inside the house. Charley could read the date. It was Wednesday\u2019s paper, open to the financial page. It was proof enough that Earl had gone to Providence to build an alibi\u2014that he\u2019d sneaked back Wednesday to kill Estelle.\nBut Charley wasn\u2019t thinking about Earl or Estelle. He was thinking about Mark and his father.\nEarl knew what Charley had seen through the window. He was on his feet, showing his teeth, ready to fight. And he held the dog by the scruff of his neck, getting the dog ready to fight, too.\nBut Charley didn\u2019t close in for a fight. He climbed into the patrol car instead. \u201cBe here when I get back,\u201d he said, and he drove down the hill after Mark.\nHe caught up with Mark at the mouth of the road. \u201cMark!\u201d he yelled. \u201cYour father delivered the paper! It\u2019s up there! He delivered it through the sleet, past the dog and everything!\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Mark. There wasn\u2019t any joy in the way he\u2019d said it.

This excited the management.\nAnyway, the job pays about $36,000, more than practically any other teaching job in the city, and you\u2019re expected to teach only two courses of your own choice or devising. The job isn\u2019t mine to offer. But, if you are interested, you might write to Professor Leo Hamalian, a fellow Arab, who is the boss of the Creative Writing Program. Other folks on his faculty are the likes of Joe Heller, Mark Mirsky, Israel Horovitz, and Joel Oppenheimer. Tell him you plan to be in New York City, if you do plan that, say you\u2019ve heard good things about his operation from me, and ask him if he might have a job for you. His address is Department of English, The City College, Convent Avenue at 137th Street, New York, N.Y. 10031.\nI\u2019m buying a house in Turtle Bay, between 2nd & 3rd, on 48th Street. I won\u2019t have a restaurant next door any more, but I\u2019ll still have a garden. I\u2019ll have a guest room, too, which is new.\nI went up to Boston University last night, gave a reading at the behest of good old George Starbuck. I hadn\u2019t seen Cathy for years. I\u2019m crazy about her.\nLove\u2014\nKurt\nNovember 16, 1973\nNew York City\nTO CHARLES MCCARTHY", 0.19440577651515156], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["harold", 0.14285714285714285], ["dunno", 0.14285714285714285], ["pause", 0.07142857142857142], ["love", 0.07142857142857142], ["garbage", 0.07142857142857142], ["wife", 0.07142857142857142], ["alice", 0.07142857142857142], ["rotten", 0.07142857142857142], ["looseleaf", 0.07142857142857142], ["manly", 0.07142857142857142], ["shuttle", 0.07142857142857142], ["wanted", 0.07142857142857142]], "sentiment": ["I dunno.

Helmholtz, head of the music department and director of the band of Lincoln High School, could sound like any musical instrument. He could shriek like a clarinet, mumble like a trombone, bawl like a trumpet. He could swell his big belly and roar like a sousaphone, could purse his lips sweetly, close his eyes, and whistle like a piccolo.\nAt eight o\u2019clock one Wednesday night, he was marching around the band rehearsal room at the school, shrieking, mumbling, bawling, roaring, and whistling \u201cSemper Fidelis.\u201d\nIt was easy for Helmholtz to do. For almost half of his forty years, he\u2019d been forming bands from the river of boys that flowed through the school. He\u2019d sung along with them all. He\u2019d sung so long and wished so hard for his bands that he dealt with life in terms of them alone.\nMarching beside the lusty pink bandmaster, his face now white with awe and concentration, was a gangly sixteen-year-old named Bert Higgens. He had a big nose, and circles under his eyes. Bert marched flappingly, like a mother flamingo pretending to be injured, luring alligators from her nest.\n\u201cRump-yump, tiddle-tiddle, rump-yump, burdle-burdle,\u201d sang Helmholtz. \u201cLeft, right, left, Bert! El-bows in, Bert! Eyes off feet, Bert! Keep on line, Bert! Don\u2019t turn head, Bert! Left, right, left, Bert!
