That was where the Rolls-Royce was bound. The plan was that Eli would enroll for the fall semester, while his father, a member of the class of 1939, attended a meeting of the Board of Overseers of the school.\n\"Don\u2019t believe this boy\u2019s feeling so good, doctor,\" said Ben. He wasn\u2019t particularly serious about it. It was more genial springtime blather.\n\"What\u2019s the matter, Eli?\" said the doctor absently. He was studying blueprints, plans for a thirty-room addition to the Eli Remenzel Memorial Dormitory\u2014a building named in honor of his great-great-grandfather. Doctor Remenzel had the plans draped over a walnut table that folded out of the back of the front seat. He was a massive, dignified man, a physician, a healer for healing\u2019s sake, since he had been born as rich as the Shah of Iran. \"Worried about something?\" he asked Eli without looking up from the plans.\n\"Nope,\" said Eli.\nEli\u2019s lovely mother, Sylvia, sat next to the doctor, reading the catalogue of the Whitehill School. \"If I were you,\" she said to Eli, \"I\u2019d be so excited I could hardly stand it.

But I must bring to your attention the fact that you have left me, your client, in such a position that I am now paying half again and more for agency services than any other author in this country. If you had named a successor when you retired, as virtually every other retiring agent has done, then that successor would be available to perform all sorts of services for me, including giving a shit about what I\u2019m doing now and what I might want to do next. The continuing commissions from past successes would help to pay for the attention of that successor and for some of his overhead.\nYou have rigged things, though, so that those commissions from past successes finance no services to me whatsoever. You have arranged things so that they are merely a sentimental salute to the past, and I have been obliged to hire Don Farber, for massive extra fees, to do what your successor would ordinarily have done.\nAs my agent, you have taken worse care of me than agents normally take care of authors, especially since I have done so much of the heavy negotiating myself\u2014such as buying back my books one-by-one from other publishers, so I could resell them to Dell.\nIn my opinion, you should take steps to ensure that I, your client, need no longer pay so much more for needed and deserved services than other authors pay. I did not volunteer to pay so much more. I was forced into it. Perhaps my situation is more common than I have so far been able to discover, is utterly customary, in fact. If so, I will be pleased to hear of similar cases. If so, I can stop thinking that I, of all authors, am perhaps the most idiotic as a businessman.\nYours truly\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut\nAugust 31, 1977\n[New York City]\nTO MAX WILKINSON\nDear Max\u2014", 0.03165869218500796], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["woodly", 0.1875], ["harold", 0.125], ["poor", 0.0625], ["intended", 0.0625], ["corpse", 0.0625], ["crucified", 0.0625], ["sins", 0.0625], ["amount", 0.0625], ["violin", 0.0625], ["lesson", 0.0625], ["cruel", 0.0625], ["died", 0.0625], ["forget", 0.0625]], "sentiment": ["WOODLY\nOh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?\nHAROLD\nIt died for your sins.\nWOODLY\nThis little corpse is intended as a lesson?\nHAROLD\nThere's a certain amount of information there.\nWOODLY\nLest we forget how cruel you are.", -0.34330357142857143], "title": "Happy Birthday, Wanda June"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["turley", 0.08088235294117647], ["milly", 0.0661764705882353], ["louis", 0.04411764705882353], ["pot", 0.022058823529411766], ["globemaster", 0.022058823529411766], ["hand", 0.022058823529411766], ["stove", 0.014705882352941176], ["father", 0.014705882352941176], ["coffee", 0.014705882352941176], ["stung", 0.014705882352941176], ["won", 0.014705882352941176], ["call", 0.014705882352941176], ["spit", 0.014705882352941176], ["kitchen", 0.014705882352941176], ["true", 0.014705882352941176], ["turned", 0.014705882352941176], ["honey", 0.014705882352941176], ["worry", 0.014705882352941176], ["boiling", 0.014705882352941176], ["wrong", 0.014705882352941176], ["man", 0.014705882352941176], ["people", 0.007352941176470588], ["find", 0.007352941176470588], ["police", 0.007352941176470588], ["subsided", 0.007352941176470588], ["tears", 0.007352941176470588], ["easy", 0.007352941176470588], ["ridiculously", 0.007352941176470588], ["big", 0.007352941176470588], ["mention", 0.007352941176470588], ["reinbeck", 0.007352941176470588], ["dreams", 0.007352941176470588], ["desperately", 0.007352941176470588], ["bewildered", 0.007352941176470588], ["equality", 0.007352941176470588], ["miracle", 0.007352941176470588], ["hung", 0.007352941176470588], ["silently", 0.007352941176470588], ["exhilarated", 0.007352941176470588], ["achieved", 0.007352941176470588], ["sends", 0.007352941176470588], ["crackle", 0.007352941176470588], ["bare", 0.007352941176470588], ["arm", 0.007352941176470588], ["burner", 0.007352941176470588], ["red", 0.007352941176470588], ["notice", 0.007352941176470588], ["free", 0.007352941176470588], ["complicated", 0.007352941176470588], ["wanted", 0.007352941176470588], ["staring", 0.007352941176470588], ["great", 0.007352941176470588], ["terrible", 0.007352941176470588], ["conversation", 0.007352941176470588], ["named", 0.007352941176470588], ["sweet", 0.007352941176470588], ["son", 0.007352941176470588], ["feet", 0.007352941176470588], ["sincerely", 0.007352941176470588], ["addressed", 0.007352941176470588], ["duck", 0.007352941176470588], ["spoke", 0.007352941176470588], ["caught", 0.007352941176470588], ["burst", 0.007352941176470588], ["thanked", 0.007352941176470588], ["twisted", 0.007352941176470588], ["panel", 0.007352941176470588], ["daze", 0.007352941176470588], ["room", 0.007352941176470588], ["air", 0.007352941176470588], ["making", 0.007352941176470588], ["called", 0.007352941176470588], ["control", 0.007352941176470588], ["murmuring", 0.007352941176470588], ["ditches", 0.007352941176470588], ["heating", 0.007352941176470588], ["talking", 0.007352941176470588], ["concentration", 0.007352941176470588], ["sir", 0.007352941176470588], ["things", 0.007352941176470588], ["holding", 0.007352941176470588], ["nice", 0.007352941176470588], ["electric", 0.007352941176470588], ["mouth", 0.007352941176470588], ["wistful", 0.007352941176470588], ["realized", 0.007352941176470588], ["apologizing", 0.007352941176470588], ["dying", 0.007352941176470588], ["face", 0.007352941176470588], ["time", 0.007352941176470588], ["dream", 0.007352941176470588], ["left", 0.007352941176470588]], "sentiment": ["From the mention of Milly\u2019s name, Turley had his conversation with the great Louis C. Reinbeck all his own way. The miracle of equality had been achieved. Turley and Louis spoke man to man, father to father, with Louis apologizing, murmuring against his own son.\nLouis thanked Turley for having called the police. Louis would call them, too. If he found out anything, he would call Turley at once. Louis addressed Turley as \u201csir.\u201d\nTurley was exhilarated when he hung up. \u201cHe sends his regards,\u201d he said to Milly. He turned to find himself talking to air. Milly had left the room silently, on bare feet.\nTurley found her heating coffee in the kitchen on the new electric stove. The stove was named the Globemaster. It had a ridiculously complicated control panel. The Globemaster was a wistful dream of Milly\u2019s come true. Not many of her dreams of nice things had come true.\nThe coffee was boiling, making the pot crackle and spit. Milly didn\u2019t notice that it was boiling, even though she was staring at the pot with terrible concentration. The pot spit, stung her hand. She burst into tears, put the stung hand to her mouth. And then she saw Turley.\nShe tried to duck past him and out of the kitchen, but he caught her arm.\n\u201cHoney,\u201d he said in a daze. He turned off the Globemaster\u2019s burner with his free hand. \u201cMilly,\u201d he said.\nMilly wanted desperately to get away. Big Turley had such an easy time holding her that he hardly realized he was doing it. Milly subsided at last, her sweet face red and twisted. \u201cWon\u2019t\u2014won\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s wrong, honey?\u201d said Turley.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d said Milly. \u201cGo worry about people dying in ditches.\u201d\nTurley let her go. \u201cI said something wrong?\u201d He was sincerely bewildered.", 0.051121212121212116], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
