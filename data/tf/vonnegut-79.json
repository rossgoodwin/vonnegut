I\u2019ve asked. She was Adam Yarmolinsky\u2019s wife by then, not mine. Jane evidently slipped away without speaking, not realizing that she wouldn\u2019t be coming up for air again. At her funeral, in an Episcopal church in Washington, D.C., Adam said to those gathered that her favorite exclamation was, \u201cI can\u2019t wait!\u201d\nWhat Jane anticipated with such joy again and again was some event involving one or more of our six children, now all adults with children of their own: a psychiatric nurse, a comedy writer, a pediatrician, a painter, an airline pilot, and a printmaker.\nI did not speak at her Episcopal obsequy. I wasn\u2019t up to it. Everything I had to say was for her ears alone, and she was gone. The last conversation we had, we two old friends from Indianapolis, was two weeks before she died. It was on the telephone. She was in Washington, D.C., where the Yarmolinskys had their home. I was in Manhattan, and married, as I still am, to the photographer and writer Jill Krementz.\nI don\u2019t know which of us initiated the call, whose nickel it was. It could have been either one of us. Whoever it was, it turned out that the point of the call was to say good-bye.\nOur son the doctor Mark would say after she died that he himself would never have submitted to all the medical procedures she acquiesced to in order to stay alive as long as she could, to go on saying, her eyes shining, \u201cI can\u2019t wait!\u201d\nOur last conversation was intimate. Jane asked me, as though I knew, what would determine the exact moment of her death. She may have felt like a character in a book by me. In a sense she was. During our twenty-two years of marriage, I had decided where we were going next, to Chicago, to Schenectady, to Cape Cod. It was my work that determined what we did next. She never had a job. Raising six kids was enough for her.\nI told her on the telephone that a sunburned, raffish, bored but not unhappy ten-year-old boy, whom we did not know, would be standing on the gravel slope of the boat-launching ramp at the foot of Scudder\u2019s Lane. He would gaze out at nothing in particular, birds, boats, or whatever, in the harbor of Barnstable, Cape Cod.\nAt the head of Scudder\u2019s Lane, on Route 6A, one-tenth of a mile from the boat-launching ramp, is the big old house where we cared for our son and two daughters and three sons of my sister\u2019s until they were grownups. Our daughter Edith and her builder husband, John Squibb, and their small sons, Will and Buck, live there now.\nI told Jane that this boy, with nothing better to do, would pick up a stone, as boys will. He would arc it over the harbor. When the stone hit the water, she would die.\nJane could believe with all her heart anything that made being alive seem full of white magic. That was her strength.

The mint green bathroom fixtures were right out in the open. Billy got off his lounge chair now, went into the bathroom and took a leak. The crowd went wild.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBilly brushed his teeth on Tralfamadore, put in his partial denture, and went into his kitchen. His bottled-gas range and his refrigerator and his dishwasher were mint green, too. There was a picture painted on the door of the refrigerator. The refrigerator had come that way. It was a picture of a Gay Nineties couple on a bicycle built for two.\nBilly looked at that picture now, tried to think something about the couple. Nothing came to him. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything to think about those two people.\nBilly ate a good breakfast from cans. He washed his cup and plate and knife and fork and spoon and saucepan, put them away. Then he did exercises he had learned in the Army\u2014straddle jumps, deep knee bends, sit-ups and push-ups. Most Tralfamadorians had no way of knowing Billy\u2019s body and face were not beautiful. They supposed that he was a splendid specimen. This had a pleasant effect on Billy, who began to enjoy his body for the first time.\nHe showered after his exercises and trimmed his toenails. He shaved, and sprayed deodorant under his arms, while a zoo guide on a raised platform outside explained what Billy was doing\u2014and why. The guide was lecturing telepathically, simply standing there, sending out thought waves to the crowd. On the platform with him was the little keyboard instrument with which he would relay questions to Billy from the crowd.\nNow the first question came\u2014from the speaker on the television set: \u201cAre you happy here?\u201d\n\u201cAbout as happy as I was on Earth,\u201d said Billy Pilgrim, which was true.\nThere were five sexes on Tralfamadore, each of them performing a step necessary in the creation of a new individual. They looked identical to Billy\u2014because their sex differences were all in the fourth dimension.\nOne of the biggest moral bombshells handed to Billy by the Tralfamadorians, incidentally had to do with sex on Earth. They said their flying-saucer crews had identified no fewer than seven sexes on Earth, each essential to reproduction. Again: Billy couldn\u2019t possibly imagine what five of those seven sexes had to do with the making of a baby, since they were sexually active only in the fourth dimension.", 0.16089630066902794], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["stake", 0.08088235294117647], ["man", 0.058823529411764705], ["soldiers", 0.03676470588235294], ["feet", 0.029411764705882353], ["inches", 0.029411764705882353], ["going", 0.022058823529411766], ["escape", 0.022058823529411766], ["thirty", 0.022058823529411766], ["message", 0.022058823529411766], ["eyes", 0.022058823529411766], ["order", 0.022058823529411766], ["find", 0.014705882352941176], ["ease", 0.014705882352941176], ["best", 0.014705882352941176], ["forty", 0.014705882352941176], ["chains", 0.014705882352941176], ["seconds", 0.014705882352941176], ["messages", 0.014705882352941176], ["unk", 0.014705882352941176], ["eleven", 0.014705882352941176], ["high", 0.014705882352941176], ["executed", 0.007352941176470588], ["help", 0.007352941176470588], ["obligations", 0.007352941176470588], ["rest", 0.007352941176470588], ["tourmaline", 0.007352941176470588], ["send", 0.007352941176470588], ["watch", 0.007352941176470588], ["judge", 0.007352941176470588], ["alkali", 0.007352941176470588], ["miles", 0.007352941176470588], ["traces", 0.007352941176470588], ["audible", 0.007352941176470588], ["twelve", 0.007352941176470588], ["parade", 0.007352941176470588], ["ten", 0.007352941176470588], ["second", 0.007352941176470588], ["happen", 0.007352941176470588], ["event", 0.007352941176470588], ["sun", 0.007352941176470588], ["method", 0.007352941176470588], ["red", 0.007352941176470588], ["movement", 0.007352941176470588], ["scientific", 0.007352941176470588], ["receivers", 0.007352941176470588], ["attention", 0.007352941176470588], ["free", 0.007352941176470588], ["permitted", 0.007352941176470588], ["great", 0.007352941176470588], ["soldier", 0.007352941176470588], ["place", 0.007352941176470588], ["composed", 0.007352941176470588], ["diameter", 0.007352941176470588], ["height", 0.007352941176470588], ["visible", 0.007352941176470588], ["feldspar", 0.007352941176470588], ["standing", 0.007352941176470588], ["silent", 0.007352941176470588], ["three", 0.007352941176470588], ["painful", 0.007352941176470588], ["relax", 0.007352941176470588], ["relaxed", 0.007352941176470588], ["varying", 0.007352941176470588], ["nineteen", 0.007352941176470588], ["mica", 0.007352941176470588], ["circumstances", 0.007352941176470588], ["sound", 0.007352941176470588], ["embedded", 0.007352941176470588], ["chained", 0.007352941176470588], ["sounds", 0.007352941176470588], ["friend", 0.007352941176470588], ["iron", 0.007352941176470588], ["meet", 0.007352941176470588], ["hoping", 0.007352941176470588], ["tugged", 0.007352941176470588], ["counting", 0.007352941176470588], ["hornblende", 0.007352941176470588], ["craned", 0.007352941176470588], ["quartz", 0.007352941176470588], ["knew", 0.007352941176470588], ["eighth", 0.007352941176470588], ["neck", 0.007352941176470588], ["ranks", 0.007352941176470588], ["scream", 0.007352941176470588], ["thought", 0.007352941176470588], ["person", 0.007352941176470588], ["haired", 0.007352941176470588]], "sentiment": ["Something painful was going to happen to the man at the stake\u2014something from which the man would want to escape very much, something from which he was not going to escape, because of the chains.\nAnd all the soldiers were going to watch.\nThe event was being given great importance.\nEven the man at the stake was standing at attention, being the best soldier he knew how to be, under the circumstances.\nAgain\u2014no audible or visible order was given, but the ten thousand soldiers executed the movement of parade rest as a man.\nSo did the man at the stake.\nThen the soldiers relaxed in ranks, as though given the order at ease. Their obligations under this order were to relax, but to keep their feet in place, and to keep silent. The soldiers were free to think a little now, and to look around and to send messages with their eyes, if they had messages and could find receivers.\nThe man at the stake tugged against his chains, craned his neck to judge the height of the stake to which he was chained. It was as though he thought he might escape by use of the scientific method, if only he could find out how high the stake was and what it was made of.\nThe stake was nineteen feet, six and five thirty-seconds inches high, not counting the twelve feet, two and one-eighth inches of it embedded in the iron. The stake had a mean diameter of two feet, five and eleven thirty-seconds inches, varying from this mean, however, by as much as seven and one thirty-second inches.

The transmitters and receivers for such spooky messages were on the surfaces of sinus cavities, and those cavities had to be healthy and clear of obstructions.\nThe chief clue which the Chinese gave the West was this puzzling sentence, delivered in English, which took years to decipher: \u201cI feel so lonesome when I get hay fever or a cold.\u201d\nHi ho.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWell, mental telepathy was useless to Eliza and me over distances greater than three meters. With one of us in the diningroom, and the other in the ballroom, our bodies might as well have been on different planets\u2014which is in fact their condition today.\nOh, sure\u2014and I could take written examinations, but Eliza could not. When \u201cAunt Cordelia\u201d tested Eliza, she had to read each question out loud to her, and then write down her answer.\nAnd it seemed to us that we missed absolutely every question. But we must have answered a few correctly, for Dr. Cordiner reported to our parents that our intelligence was \u201c\u2026 low normal for their age.\u201d\nShe said further, not knowing that we were eavesdropping, that Eliza would probably never learn to read or write, and hence could never be a voter or hold a driver\u2019s license. She tried to soften this some by observing that Eliza was \u201c\u2026 quite an amusing chatterbox.\u201d\nShe said that I was \u201c\u2026 a good boy, a serious boy\u2014easily distracted by his scatter-brained sister. He reads and writes, but has a poor comprehension of the meanings of words and sentences. If he were separated from his sister, there is every reason to believe that he could become a fillingstation attendant or a janitor in a village school.

bankers felt somewhat cheated, since George didn't seem to be drawing any sort of moral from what should have been an important experience in almost any man's life. One lawyer, who had been looking forward to pointing out the moral when George got mad, couldn't restrain himself from pointing it out anyway, even though George was laughing: \"People should always read things before they sign them.\"\n\"You can bet your boots,\" said George, \"that from now on I will.\"\nGeorge Rosewater obviously wasn't a well man when he came back from the war, for no well man, having lost his eyes and his patrimony, would have laughed so much. And a well man, particularly if he were a general and a hero, might have taken some vigorous legal steps to compel his brother to return his property. But George filed no suit. He did not wait for Noah to return to Rosewater County, and he did not go East to find him. In fact, he and Noah were never to meet or communicate again.\nHe paid a call, wearing the full regalia of a brigadier, to each Rosewater County household that had given him a boy or boys to command, praising them all, mourning with all his heart for the boys who were wounded or dead. Noah Rosewater's brick mansion was being built at that time. One morning the workmen found the brigadier's uniform nailed to the front door as though it were an animal skin nailed to a barn door to dry.\nAs far as Rosewater County was concerned, George Rosewater had disappeared forever.\nGeorge went East like a vagabond, not to find and kill his brother, but to seek work in Providence, Rhode Island. He had heard that a broom factory was being opened there. It was to be staffed by Union veterans who were blind.\nWhat he had heard was true. There was such a factory, founded by Castor Buntline, who was neither a veteran nor blind. Buntline perceived correctly that blind veterans would make very agreeable employees, that Buntline himself would gain a place in history as a humanitarian, and that no Northern patriot, for several years after the war, anyway, would use anything but a Buntline Union Beacon Broom. Thus was the great Buntline fortune begun. And, with broom profits, Castor Buntline and his spastic son Elihu went carpetbagging, became tobacco kings.\nWhen the footsore, amiable General George Rosewater arrived at the broom factory, Castor Buntline wrote to Washington, confirmed that George was a general, hired George at a very good salary, made him foreman, and named the whisk-brooms the factory was making after him. The brand name entered ordinary speech for a little while. A \"General Rosewater\" was a whiskbroom.\nAnd blind George was given a fourteen-year-old girl, an orphan named Faith Merrihue, who was to be his eyes and his messenger. When she was sixteen, George married her.", 0.05750000000000001], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["nantucket", 0.02830188679245283], ["sarah", 0.02830188679245283], ["sutton", 0.02830188679245283], ["tillie", 0.018867924528301886], ["california", 0.018867924528301886], ["thirty", 0.018867924528301886], ["long", 0.018867924528301886], ["nineteen", 0.018867924528301886], ["died", 0.018867924528301886], ["orchestras", 0.009433962264150943], ["gold", 0.009433962264150943], ["furnished", 0.009433962264150943], ["shrugged", 0.009433962264150943], ["maine", 0.009433962264150943], ["girlhood", 0.009433962264150943], ["apartment", 0.009433962264150943], ["founder", 0.009433962264150943], ["fit", 0.009433962264150943], ["bookish", 0.009433962264150943], ["wyoming", 0.009433962264150943], ["father", 0.009433962264150943], ["maid", 0.009433962264150943], ["weeks", 0.009433962264150943], ["mused", 0.009433962264150943], ["viking", 0.009433962264150943], ["returned", 0.009433962264150943], ["nomads", 0.009433962264150943], ["penniless", 0.009433962264150943], ["records", 0.009433962264150943], ["bar", 0.009433962264150943], ["chairs", 0.009433962264150943], ["die", 0.009433962264150943], ["marry", 0.009433962264150943], ["grandfather", 0.009433962264150943], ["harbor", 0.009433962264150943], ["continue", 0.009433962264150943], ["referred", 0.009433962264150943], ["people", 0.009433962264150943], ["house", 0.009433962264150943], ["decided", 0.009433962264150943], ["uncomfortable", 0.009433962264150943], ["mccone", 0.009433962264150943], ["canada", 0.009433962264150943], ["whaling", 0.009433962264150943], ["waiting", 0.009433962264150943], ["told", 0.009433962264150943], ["europe", 0.009433962264150943], ["servants", 0.009433962264150943], ["sold", 0.009433962264150943], ["jilt", 0.009433962264150943], ["toilette", 0.009433962264150943], ["imagine", 0.009433962264150943], ["imaginary", 0.009433962264150943], ["card", 0.009433962264150943], ["great", 0.009433962264150943], ["folding", 0.009433962264150943], ["vikings", 0.009433962264150943], ["place", 0.009433962264150943], ["depart", 0.009433962264150943], ["family", 0.009433962264150943], ["phlogiston", 0.009433962264150943], ["lies", 0.009433962264150943], ["table", 0.009433962264150943], ["support", 0.009433962264150943], ["captains", 0.009433962264150943], ["live", 0.009433962264150943], ["lot", 0.009433962264150943], ["biggest", 0.009433962264150943], ["complete", 0.009433962264150943], ["oregon", 0.009433962264150943], ["finished", 0.009433962264150943], ["treasures", 0.009433962264150943], ["survived", 0.009433962264150943], ["eat", 0.009433962264150943], ["rush", 0.009433962264150943], ["bed", 0.009433962264150943], ["teachers", 0.009433962264150943], ["iron", 0.009433962264150943], ["agree", 0.009433962264150943], ["bridge", 0.009433962264150943], ["ready", 0.009433962264150943], ["summers", 0.009433962264150943], ["cuyahoga", 0.009433962264150943], ["starbuck", 0.009433962264150943], ["pure", 0.009433962264150943], ["grand", 0.009433962264150943], ["descended", 0.009433962264150943], ["ball", 0.009433962264150943], ["built", 0.009433962264150943], ["ago", 0.009433962264150943], ["spent", 0.009433962264150943], ["element", 0.009433962264150943], ["order", 0.009433962264150943], ["left", 0.009433962264150943]], "sentiment": ["\u201c\u2018Starbuck\u2014\u2019 \u201cshe mused. \u201cI believe that\u2019s an old Nantucket name.\u201d\nI was ready for that one, too. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cbut my great-grandfather left Nantucket for the Gold Rush and never returned.

The underground stream which passed through the bowels of Sacred Miracle Cave was polluted by some sort of industrial waste which formed bubbles as tough as ping-pong balls. These bubbles were shouldering one another up a passage which led to a big boulder which had been painted white to resemble Moby Dick, the Great White Whale. The bubbles would soon engulf Moby Dick and invade the Cathedral of Whispers, which was the main attraction at the cave. Thousands of people had been married in the Cathedral of Whispers\u2014including Dwayne and Lyle and Kyle. Harry LeSabre, too.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLyle told Dwayne about an experiment he and Kyle had performed the night before. They had gone into the cave with their identical Browning Automatic Shotguns, and they had opened fire on the advancing wall of bubbles.\n\u201cThey let loose a stink you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d said Lyle. He said it smelled like athlete\u2019s foot. \u201cIt drove me and Kyle right out of there. We run the ventilating system for an hour, and then we went back in. The paint was blistered on Moby Dick. He ain\u2019t even got eyes anymore.\u201d Moby Dick used to have long-lashed blue eyes as big as dinner plates.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cThe organ turned black, and the ceiling turned a kind of dirty yellow,\u201d said Lyle. \u201cYou can\u2019t hardly see the Sacred Miracle no more.\u201d\nThe organ was the Pipe Organ of the Gods, a thicket of stalactites and stalagmites which had grown together in one corner of the Cathedral. There was a loudspeaker in back of it, through which music for weddings and funerals was played. It was illuminated by electric lights, which changed colors all the time.\nThe Sacred Miracle was a cross on the ceiling of the Cathedral. It was formed by the intersection of two cracks. \u201cIt never was real easy to see,\u201d said Lyle, speaking of the cross. \u201cI ain\u2019t even sure it\u2019s there anymore.\u201d He asked Dwayne\u2019s permission to order a load of cement. He wanted to plug up the passage between the stream and the Cathedral.\n\u201cJust forget about Moby Dick and Jesse James and the slaves and all that,\u201d said Lyle, \u201cand save the Cathedral.\u201d\nJesse James was a skeleton which Dwayne\u2019s stepfather had bought from the estate of a doctor back during the Great Depression. The bones of its right hand mingled with the rusted parts of a .45 caliber revolver.
