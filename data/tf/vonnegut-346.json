indeed is your Slaughterhouse-5? Have you considered cutting off an ear and sending it to a prostitute? These things take time. Remember Herman Melville. Remember F. Scott Fitzgerald, who was completely out-of-print when he died so young. Remember Francois Villon, who made himself immortal with a mere thousand lines of poetry and then, like Ambrose Bierce, simply disappeared. It seems to me that your permanent contributions to civilization have been substantial, although the paymasters, being thugs, may never come to see that. Or care.\nThe important novelist Richard Yates and I used to deliver a highly unpopular joint lecture each semester at the Writers Workshop in Iowa City on the subject of how to survive in a Free Enterprise Economy by means of hackwork. We had both done a lot of that, without serious damage, seemingly, to our souls or intellects. Not that it felt good.\nSpeaking of hackwork: I finally heard from the bright and sweet and melancholy Marc Leeds\u2014only a week ago. I thought maybe he had found our Iowa roadshow repellent somehow. Not at all. The trouble was that he had to take a second minimum wage teaching job at an even creepier little college in order to feed his family, so now, like the Flying Dutchman, he is forever commuting between Portsmouth, Ohio, and Johnson City, Tennessee. I hope he knows how to change a tire.\nThe relief agency CARE sent me to Mozambique a few weeks ago, in an effort to get some publicity in this country about the hell Freedom Fighters have been making of that place since 1976. We flew from refugee center to refugee center in light planes, since the Freedom Fighters made Swiss cheese out of anything that dared venture out of town on a highway. There was a TV crew along, and they got a lot of footage of me looking at people who were slowly starving to death. Want to see it and maybe copy it? It wouldn\u2019t cost you anything.\nLove as always,\nKurt Vonnegut\nTHE NINETIES\nAfter going to Mozambique at the end of 1989, Kurt wrote of the experience in Fates Worse Than Death that \u201cif you color the people in old photographs of Auschwitz shades of brown and black, you would see what was commonly seen in Mozambique.\u201d When he got back and wrote his article about it, \u201cI got a room at the old Royalton Hotel in Manhattan, and I found myself crying so hard I was barking like a dog. I didn\u2019t come close to doing that after WWII. The last time I cried (and I did it quietly, and didn\u2019t bark like a dog) was when my first wife \u2026 Jane died.\u201d\nIn 1990, Hocus Pocus was published, and the next year Fates Worse Than Death, his \u201cautobiographical collage,\u201d came out. His next and last novel, Timequake (1997), was itself a kind of collage\u2014of autobiography and fiction. He would add to his autobiographical writing at the end of the decade in an introduction to Bagombo Snuff Box (1999), a collection of previously uncollected short stories that Peter Reed assembled and persuaded Kurt to publish. That same year he wrote a series of twenty-one segments broadcast for WNYC (New York\u2019s public radio station), imagining himself as a \u201creporter on the afterlife,\u201d with interviews of the famous and infamous ranging from Shakespeare to Hitler; they were published as the book God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian.\nHe had struggled with the writing of Timequake, and his longtime professor friend Jerome Klinkowitz helped him devise a category for the second draft that satisfied his editor, calling it \u201cthe autobiography of a novel.\u201d He complained he was tired of writing during these years, explaining in Timequake that he was feeling \u201clike whalers Herman Melville described, who didn\u2019t talk anymore. They had said absolutely everything they could ever say.\u201d", -0.00973842195540309], "title": "Letters"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["em", 0.02857142857142857], ["lou", 0.02857142857142857], ["apartment", 0.01904761904761905], ["going", 0.01904761904761905], ["television", 0.01904761904761905], ["set", 0.01904761904761905], ["schwartzes", 0.01904761904761905], ["room", 0.01904761904761905], ["hour", 0.01904761904761905], ["washbasin", 0.01904761904761905], ["000", 0.01904761904761905], ["schwartz", 0.009523809523809525], ["years", 0.009523809523809525], ["cries", 0.009523809523809525], ["hauled", 0.009523809523809525], ["battle", 0.009523809523809525], ["gramps", 0.009523809523809525], ["solitary", 0.009523809523809525], ["police", 0.009523809523809525], ["spacious", 0.009523809523809525], ["good", 0.009523809523809525], ["cots", 0.009523809523809525], ["76th", 0.009523809523809525], ["fingers", 0.009523809523809525], ["gee", 0.009523809523809525], ["half", 0.009523809523809525], ["wagons", 0.009523809523809525], ["viewers", 0.009523809523809525], ["held", 0.009523809523809525], ["works", 0.009523809523809525], ["caboodle", 0.009523809523809525], ["turnkey", 0.009523809523809525], ["lawyer", 0.009523809523809525], ["year", 0.009523809523809525], ["wonder", 0.009523809523809525], ["loudspeaker", 0.009523809523809525], ["televised", 0.009523809523809525], ["forty", 0.009523809523809525], ["filled", 0.009523809523809525], ["shakes", 0.009523809523809525], ["screen", 0.009523809523809525], ["seaboard", 0.009523809523809525], ["kit", 0.009523809523809525], ["peacefully", 0.009523809523809525], ["ambulances", 0.009523809523809525], ["appeared", 0.009523809523809525], ["delighted", 0.009523809523809525], ["stretched", 0.009523809523809525], ["257", 0.009523809523809525], ["harmlessly", 0.009523809523809525], ["three", 0.009523809523809525], ["long", 0.009523809523809525], ["station", 0.009523809523809525], ["interest", 0.009523809523809525], ["films", 0.009523809523809525], ["500", 0.009523809523809525], ["riot", 0.009523809523809525], ["eastern", 0.009523809523809525], ["ha", 0.009523809523809525], ["pull", 0.009523809523809525], ["kind", 0.009523809523809525], ["cells", 0.009523809523809525], ["bed", 0.009523809523809525], ["air", 0.009523809523809525], ["ain", 0.009523809523809525], ["stages", 0.009523809523809525], ["called", 0.009523809523809525], ["patrol", 0.009523809523809525], ["toss", 0.009523809523809525], ["captors", 0.009523809523809525], ["dreamily", 0.009523809523809525], ["watched", 0.009523809523809525], ["thought", 0.009523809523809525], ["floor", 0.009523809523809525], ["hon", 0.009523809523809525], ["cross", 0.009523809523809525], ["adjacent", 0.009523809523809525], ["wires", 0.009523809523809525], ["crashes", 0.009523809523809525], ["hand", 0.009523809523809525], ["coming", 0.009523809523809525], ["fray", 0.009523809523809525], ["building", 0.009523809523809525], ["light", 0.009523809523809525], ["partition", 0.009523809523809525], ["grunts", 0.009523809523809525], ["pipe", 0.009523809523809525], ["stillness", 0.009523809523809525], ["jail", 0.009523809523809525], ["time", 0.009523809523809525], ["professional", 0.009523809523809525], ["left", 0.009523809523809525]], "sentiment": ["For the next half-hour, patrol wagons and ambulances hauled away Schwartzes, and then the apartment was still and spacious.\nAn hour later, films of the last stages of the riot were being televised to 500,000,000 delighted viewers on the Eastern Seaboard.\nIn the stillness of the three-room Schwartz apartment on the 76th floor of Building 257, the television set had been left on.
