It was only recently, too, that I learned that they had found themselves as leprous as I was, and what had become of them in Florida, and on and on.\nThe source of all this information about the Metzgers has been, of course, their lawyer, who is now our lawyer, Bernard Ketchum.\nOnly at the age of fifty, thirty-eight years after I destroyed Mrs. Metzger\u2019s life, my life, and my parents\u2019 life with a bullet, have I asked anyone how the Metzgers were. It was right here by the swimming pool at two in the morning. All the hotel guests were asleep, not that they are ever all that numerous. Felix and his new wife, his fifth wife, were there. Ketchum and his first and only wife were there. And I was there. Where was my mate? Who knows? I think I am a homosexual, but I can\u2019t be sure. I have never made love to anyone.\nNor have I tasted alcohol, except for homeopathic doses of it in certain recipes\u2014but the others had been drinking champagne. Not since I was twelve, for that matter, have I swallowed coffee or tea, or taken a medicine, not even an aspirin or a laxative or an antacid or an antibiotic of any sort. This is an especially odd record for a person who is, as I am, a registered pharmacist, and who was the solitary employee on the night shift of Midland City\u2019s only all-night drugstore for years and years.\nSo be it.", 0.056079311634867186], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["private", 0.13793103448275862], ["will", 0.06896551724137931], ["understand", 0.06896551724137931], ["love", 0.034482758620689655], ["looked", 0.034482758620689655], ["shrugged", 0.034482758620689655], ["lamely", 0.034482758620689655], ["living", 0.034482758620689655], ["privacy", 0.034482758620689655], ["twenty", 0.034482758620689655], ["copies", 0.034482758620689655], ["long", 0.034482758620689655], ["music", 0.034482758620689655], ["surprised", 0.034482758620689655], ["nice", 0.034482758620689655], ["nation", 0.034482758620689655], ["tenderly", 0.034482758620689655], ["word", 0.034482758620689655], ["joke", 0.034482758620689655], ["favorite", 0.034482758620689655], ["blankly", 0.034482758620689655], ["jokes", 0.034482758620689655], ["time", 0.034482758620689655], ["piece", 0.034482758620689655]], "sentiment": ["\u201cMy favorite piece of music,\u201d I said. \u201cI love it so much, I have twenty-six copies of it.\u201d\nShe looked at me blankly. \u201cYou do?\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2014it\u2019s a private joke,\u201d I said lamely.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPrivate\u2014\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve been living alone so long, everything about me\u2019s private.

accumulated around her anchor line. That rusty little ship had become such a permanent fixture that it might as well have been a lifeless rock out there. But now he saw that a small tanker had come alongside the San Mateo, and was nursing it as a whale might have nursed a calf. It was excreting diesel fuel through a flexible tube. That would be mother\u2019s milk to the engine of the San Mateo.\nWhat had happened was that the San Mateo\u2019s owners had received a large number of United States dollars in exchange for Colombian cocaine, and smuggled those dollars into Ecuador, where they were traded not only for diesel fuel, but for the most precious commodity of all, which was food, which was fuel for human beings. So there was still a certain amount of international commerce going on.\nCruz could not divine the details of the corruption which had made the fueling and provisioning of the San Mateo possible, but he surely meditated on corruption in general, to wit: Anybody who had liquid wealth, whether he deserved it or not, could have anything he wanted. The captain in the shower was such a person, as Cruz was not. The painstakingly accumulated lifetime savings of Cruz, all in sucres, had turned to trash.\nHe envied the elation the San Mateo\u2019s crewmen were feeling, now that they were going home. Since rising at dawn, Cruz himself had been thinking seriously about going home. He had a pregnant wife and eleven children in a nice house out by the airport, and they were scared. They certainly needed him, and yet, until now, abandoning a ship to which he was duty bound, no matter for what reason, had seemed to him a form of suicide, an obliteration of all that was admirable in his character and reputation.\nBut now he decided to walk off the Bah\u00eda de Darwin anyway. He patted the rail around the sun deck, and he said this softly in Spanish: \u201cGood luck, my Swedish princess. I shall dream of you.\u201d\nHis case was very much like that of Jes\u00fas Ortiz, who had disconnected the El Dorado\u2019s telephones. His big brain had concealed from his soul until the last possible moment its conclusion that it was now time for him to act antisocially.\nThat left Adolf von Kleist completely in charge, although he did not know shit from Shinola about navigation, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, or the operation and maintenance of a ship that size.\nThe combination of the Captain\u2019s incompetence and the decision of Hernando Cruz to go to the aid of his own flesh and blood, although the stuff of low comedy at the time, has turned out to be of incalculable value to present-day humankind. So much for comedy. So much for supposedly serious stuff.\nIf \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d had come off as planned, the division of duties between the Captain and his first mate would have been typical of the management of so many organizations a million years ago, with the nominal leader specializing in sociable balderdash, and with the supposed second-in-command burdened with the responsibility of understanding how things really worked, and what was really going on.\nThe best-run nations commonly had such symbiotic pairings at the top. And when I think about the suicidal mistakes nations used to make in olden times, I see that those polities were trying to get along with just an Adolf von Kleist at the top, without an Hernando Cruz. Too late, the surviving inhabitants of such a nation would crawl from ruins of their own creation and realize that, throughout all their self-imposed agony, there had been absolutely nobody at the top who had understood how things really worked, what it was all about, what was really going on.", 0.12971288515406165], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["normandie", 0.02830188679245283], ["harbor", 0.018867924528301886], ["motor", 0.018867924528301886], ["beautiful", 0.018867924528301886], ["ship", 0.018867924528301886], ["built", 0.018867924528301886], ["dancing", 0.018867924528301886], ["liner", 0.018867924528301886], ["berman", 0.018867924528301886], ["agency", 0.009433962264150943], ["shoes", 0.009433962264150943], ["rest", 0.009433962264150943], ["held", 0.009433962264150943], ["paper", 0.009433962264150943], ["hack", 0.009433962264150943], ["converting", 0.009433962264150943], ["displaying", 0.009433962264150943], ["shamelessly", 0.009433962264150943], ["cut", 0.009433962264150943], ["1942", 0.009433962264150943], ["orbs", 0.009433962264150943], ["sky", 0.009433962264150943], ["going", 0.009433962264150943], ["outrage", 0.009433962264150943], ["psychiatrist", 0.009433962264150943], ["big", 0.009433962264150943], ["cook", 0.009433962264150943], ["painted", 0.009433962264150943], ["february", 0.009433962264150943], ["kennedy", 0.009433962264150943], ["artist", 0.009433962264150943], ["hung", 0.009433962264150943], ["erotic", 0.009433962264150943], ["sexual", 0.009433962264150943], ["sail", 0.009433962264150943], ["bully", 0.009433962264150943], ["voluptuous", 0.009433962264150943], ["troopship", 0.009433962264150943], ["french", 0.009433962264150943], ["met", 0.009433962264150943], ["wu", 0.009433962264150943], ["york", 0.009433962264150943], ["address", 0.009433962264150943], ["daughter", 0.009433962264150943], ["exaggerated", 0.009433962264150943], ["jackie", 0.009433962264150943], ["soldier", 0.009433962264150943], ["dinner", 0.009433962264150943], ["advertising", 0.009433962264150943], ["smoke", 0.009433962264150943], ["golden", 0.009433962264150943], ["heeled", 0.009433962264150943], ["cocked", 0.009433962264150943], ["africa", 0.009433962264150943], ["majestic", 0.009433962264150943], ["thick", 0.009433962264150943], ["figure", 0.009433962264150943], ["damn", 0.009433962264150943], ["low", 0.009433962264150943], ["war", 0.009433962264150943], ["uncontrollable", 0.009433962264150943], ["north", 0.009433962264150943], ["fire", 0.009433962264150943], ["poster", 0.009433962264150943], ["overwhelmingly", 0.009433962264150943], ["workmen", 0.009433962264150943], ["soul", 0.009433962264150943], ["will", 0.009433962264150943], ["sam", 0.009433962264150943], ["sag", 0.009433962264150943], ["high", 0.009433962264150943], ["dress", 0.009433962264150943], ["absolute", 0.009433962264150943], ["travel", 0.009433962264150943], ["peace", 0.009433962264150943], ["write", 0.009433962264150943], ["started", 0.009433962264150943], ["luscious", 0.009433962264150943], ["teetered", 0.009433962264150943], ["belly", 0.009433962264150943], ["front", 0.009433962264150943], ["party", 0.009433962264150943], ["beach", 0.009433962264150943], ["picture", 0.009433962264150943], ["serene", 0.009433962264150943], ["cocktail", 0.009433962264150943], ["ladder", 0.009433962264150943], ["drives", 0.009433962264150943], ["skintight", 0.009433962264150943], ["moment", 0.009433962264150943], ["arrived", 0.009433962264150943], ["smiled", 0.009433962264150943], ["southampton", 0.009433962264150943], ["ocean", 0.009433962264150943], ["ferrari", 0.009433962264150943], ["foyer", 0.009433962264150943]], "sentiment": ["\u201cShe met a psychiatrist on the beach,\u201d said the cook.\n\u201cHe drives a Ferrari,\u201d said her daughter. \u201cHe held the ladder for her while she hung the paper.

When it was finished, students would be able to sit in soundproof booths and listen to recordings of any one of more than 100 languages and dialects made by native speakers.\nTHE LIGHTS WERE on in the sculpture studio of Norman Rockwell Hall, the art building, the only structure on campus named after a historical figure rather than the donating family. It was another gift from the Moellenkamps, who may have felt that too much was named after them already.\nThere was a whirring and rumbling coming from inside the sculpture studio. Somebody was playing with the crane in there, making it run back and forth on its tracks overhead. Whoever it was had to be playing, since nobody ever made a piece of sculpture so big that it could be moved only by the mighty crane.\nAfter the prison break, there was some talk on the part of the convicts of hanging somebody from it, and running him back and forth while he strangled. They had no particular candidate in mind. But then the Niagara Power and Light Company, which was owned by the Unification Church Korean Evangelical Association, shut off all our electricity.\nOUTSIDE ROCKWELL HALL that night, I might have been back on a patrol in Vietnam. That is how keen my senses were. That was how quick my mind was to create a whole picture from the slightest clues.\nI knew that the sculpture studio was locked up tight after 6:30 P.M., since I had tried the door many times, thinking that I might sometime bring a lover there. I had considered getting a key somehow at the start of the semester and learned from Buildings and Grounds that only they and that year\u2019s Artist in Residence, the sculptress Pamela Ford Hall, were allowed to have keys. This was because of vandalism by either students or Townies in the studio the year before.\nThey knocked off the noses and fingers of replicas of Greek statues, and defecated in a bucket of wet clay. That sort of thing.\nSO THAT HAD to be Pamela Ford Hall in there making the crane go back and forth. And the crane\u2019s restless travels had to represent unhappiness, not any masterpiece she was creating. What use did she have for a crane, or even a wheelbarrow, since she worked exclusively in nearly weightless polyurethane. And she was a recent divorcee without children. And, because she knew my reputation, I\u2019m sure, she had been avoiding me.\nI climbed up on the studio\u2019s loading dock. I thumped my fist on its enormous sliding door. The door was motor driven.
