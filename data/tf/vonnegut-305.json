That\u2019s fast.\nI will be going to England for two weeks, starting February 16, in order to hustle Deadeye Dick. I will also get to see the documentary about me which BBC shot last month. They did it for a show called Arena. It may be that you can make use of some of their footage. The director was Nigel Finch, a most pleasant young man. PBS has no plans, the last I heard, for showing it over here. When I come back in March, I will have a tape with me. Maybe we should both have a look at it, and then a long talk, to make sure that a show about me would look like much, could look like much. As I told you: I cooperated with BBC at the insistence of my British publisher. The project took only about six days out of my life.\nAs a business proposition for you, for me, and for your backers, the notion of making a movie based on a novel seems a lot more exciting. Cat\u2019s Cradle can be bought back from Hilly Elkins for about $100,000, what he has tied up in it. I own Jailbird, which was a number one best seller for several months. Sirens is still under option, which probably won\u2019t be renewed this year. There must be a slew of scripts for Sirens by now. Mother Night is available. People option it and drop it. Player Piano gets more timely with each passing day. It could be an up-to-date Modern Times, if you could find another Chaplin.\nI hate to say this, but a great director can make a wonderful movie out of anything.\nHappy New Year\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut\nFebruary 10, 1983\nNew York City\nTO CHARLES RAY EWICK, INDIANA STATE LIBRARY\nDear Mr. Ewick\u2014", 0.2652020202020202], "title": "Letters"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["love", 0.12], ["bye", 0.08], ["sweet", 0.08], ["good", 0.08], ["drove", 0.08], ["danger", 0.04], ["promises", 0.04], ["rice", 0.04], ["magic", 0.04], ["stranger", 0.04], ["song", 0.04], ["prove", 0.04], ["ne", 0.04], ["gentle", 0.04], ["radio", 0.04], ["harm", 0.04], ["time", 0.04], ["playing", 0.04], ["er", 0.04]], "sentiment": ["She got out, and Rice drove away.\nAs he drove away, the radio came on.
