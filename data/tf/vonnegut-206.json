future on Earth. With everyone so kind and enthusiastic and peaceful, not only a good life but a perfect life could be lived on Earth.\nThe Space Wanderer had already been given a fine new suit and a glamorous station in life, and his mate and son were to be restored to him in a matter of minutes.\nAll that was lacking was a good friend, and the Space Wanderer began to tremble. He trembled, for he knew in his heart that his best friend, Stony Stevenson, was hidden somewhere on the grounds, awaiting a cue to appear.\nThe Space Wanderer smiled, for he was imagining Stony\u2019s entrance. Stony would come running down a ramp, laughing and a little drunk. \"Unk, you bloody bastard\u2014\" Stony would roar right into the public address system, \"by God, I\u2019ve looked in every flaming pub on bloody Earth for you\u2014and here you\u2019ve been hung up on Mercury the whole bloody time!\"\nAs Bee and Chrono reached Rumfoord and the Space Wanderer, Rumfoord walked away. Had he separated himself from Bee, Chrono, and the Space Wanderer by a mere arm\u2019s length, his separateness might have been understood. But the gilded system enabled him to put a really respectable distance between himself and the three, and not only a distance, but a distance made tortuous by rococo and variously symbolic hazards.\nIt was undeniably great theater, notwithstanding Dr. Maurice Rosenau\u2019s carping comment (op. cit.): \"The people who watch reverently as Winston Niles Rumfoord goes dancing over his golden jungle gym in Newport are the same idiots one finds in toy stores, gaping reverently at toy trains as the trains go chuffa-chuffa-chuffa in and out of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 tunnels, over toothpick trestles, through cardboard cities, and into papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 tunnels again. Will the little trains or will Winston Niles Rumfoord chuffa-chuffa-chuffa into view again? Oh, mirabile dictu! ... they will!\"\nFrom the scaffold in front of the mansion Rumfoord went to a stile that arched over the crest of a boxwood hedge. On the other side of the stile was a catwalk that ran for ten feet to the trunk of a copper beech. The trunk was four feet through. Gilded rungs were fixed to the trunk by lag screws.\nRumfoord tied Kazak to the bottom rung, then climbed out of sight like Jack on the beanstalk.\nFrom somewhere up in the tree he spoke.\nHis voice came not from the tree but from the Gabriel horns on the walls.", 0.1336403782367324], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["catch", 0.13043478260869565], ["idea", 0.08695652173913043], ["kind", 0.043478260869565216], ["knew", 0.043478260869565216], ["objects", 0.043478260869565216], ["frank", 0.043478260869565216], ["began", 0.043478260869565216], ["object", 0.043478260869565216], ["vin", 0.043478260869565216], ["admitted", 0.043478260869565216], ["will", 0.043478260869565216], ["dit", 0.043478260869565216], ["good", 0.043478260869565216], ["interested", 0.043478260869565216], ["hear", 0.043478260869565216], ["election", 0.043478260869565216], ["great", 0.043478260869565216], ["president", 0.043478260869565216], ["shrink", 0.043478260869565216], ["care", 0.043478260869565216]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be an election?\u201d\n\u201cThere never has been.

fleet\u2014it wasn\u2019t touched!\"\n\"The guns seem to be drooping,\" said Mr. Cuthrell.\nWe left the bench and clustered about the television set to examine the damage more closely. What Mr. Cuthrell had said was true. The ships\u2019 guns curved downward, their muzzles resting on the steel decks. We in Virginia were making such a hullabaloo that it was impossible to hear the radio reports. We were so engrossed, in fact, that we didn\u2019t miss the professor until two short snarls of Barnhouse static shocked us into sudden silence. The radios went dead.\nWe looked around apprehensively. The professor was gone. A harassed guard threw open the front door from the outside to yell that the professor had escaped. He brandished his pistol in the direction of the gates, which hung open, limp and twisted. In the distance, a speeding government station wagon topped a ridge and dropped from sight into the valley beyond. The air was filled with choking smoke, for every vehicle on the grounds was ablaze. Pursuit was impossible.\n\"What in God\u2019s name got into him?\" bellowed the general.\nMr. Cuthrell, who had rushed out onto the front porch, now slouched back into the room, reading a penciled note as he came. He thrust the note into my hands. \"The good man left this billet-doux under the door knocker. Perhaps our young friend here will be kind enough to read it to you gentlemen, while I take a restful walk through the woods.\"\n\"Gentlemen,\" I read aloud, \"as the first superweapon with a conscience, I am removing myself from your national defense stockpile. Setting a new precedent in the behavior of ordnance, I have humane reasons for going off. A. Barnhouse.\"\nSince that day, of course, the professor has been systematically destroying the world\u2019s armaments, until there is now little with which to equip an army other than rocks and sharp sticks. His activities haven\u2019t exactly resulted in peace, but have, rather, precipitated a bloodless and entertaining sort of war that might be called the \"War of the Tattletales.\" Every nation is flooded with enemy agents whose sole mission is to locate military equipment, which is promptly wrecked when it is brought to the professor\u2019s attention in the press.\nJust as every day brings news of more armaments. pulverized by dynamopsychism, so has it brought rumors of the professor\u2019s whereabouts. During last week alone, three publications carried articles proving variously that he was hiding in an Inca ruin in the Andes, in the sewers of Paris, and in the unexplored lower chambers of Carlsbad Caverns. Knowing the man, I am inclined to regard such hiding places as unnecessarily romantic and uncomfortable. While there are numerous persons eager to kill him, there must be millions who would care for him and hide him. I like to think that he is in the home of such a person.\nOne thing is certain: at this writing, Professor Barnhouse is not dead. Barnhouse static jammed broadcasts not ten minutes ago. In the eighteen months since his disappearance, he has been reported dead some half-dozen times. Each report has stemmed from the death of an unidentified man resembling the professor, during a period free of the static. The first three reports were followed at once by renewed talk of rearmament and recourse to war. The saber-rattlers have learned how imprudent premature celebrations of the professor\u2019s demise can be.", 0.044804154179154176], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "look-at-the-birdie":

His arms went limp with renewed anxiety and disgust. The rock crashed down on the others. The dome-shaped house, its interior solid with limestone deposits, shattered into a dozen wedges.\nAgain the brothers\u2019 irresistible curiosities took command. They sank to their knees to pick over the fragments. The more durable contents of the house had been locked in rock for eons, only now to meet air and sunlight. The perishable furnishings had left their impressions.\n\u201cBooks\u2014dozens of them,\u201d said Peter, turning a fragment this way and that to count the now-familiar rectangular specks.\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s a painting. I swear it is!\u201d cried Josef.\n\u201cThey\u2019d discovered the wheel! Look at this wagon, Josef!\u201d A fit of triumphant laughing burst from Peter. \u201cJosef,\u201d he gasped, \u201cdo you realize that we have made the most sensational discovery in history? Ants once had a culture as rich and brilliant as ours. Music! Painting! Literature! Think of it!\u201d\n\u201cAnd lived in houses\u2014aboveground, with plenty of room, and lots of air and sunshine,\u201d said Josef raptly. \u201cAnd they had fire and cooked.

In all, they found fifty-three of the houses, each different\u2014some large, some small, varying from domes to cubes, each one a work of individuality and imagination. The houses seemed to have been spaced far apart, and rarely were they occupied by more than a male and a female and young.\nJosef grinned foolishly, incredulously. \u201cPeter, are we drunk or crazy?\u201d He sat in silence, smoking a cigarette and periodically shaking his head. \u201cDo you realize it\u2019s lunchtime? It seems as though we\u2019ve been here about ten minutes. Hungry?\u201d\nPeter shook his head impatiently, and began digging through the second box\u2014fossils from the next layer up, eager to solve the puzzle of how the magnificent ant civilization had declined to the dismal, instinctive ant way of life of the present.", 0.17721781305114637], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["chicken", 0.10526315789473684], ["leghorn", 0.08771929824561403], ["jerry", 0.05263157894736842], ["roaster", 0.03508771929824561], ["sam", 0.03508771929824561], ["sally", 0.03508771929824561], ["language", 0.03508771929824561], ["lsd", 0.017543859649122806], ["moments", 0.017543859649122806], ["tonic", 0.017543859649122806], ["rooster", 0.017543859649122806], ["heard", 0.017543859649122806], ["laboratory", 0.017543859649122806], ["nobel", 0.017543859649122806], ["expressive", 0.017543859649122806], ["agrees", 0.017543859649122806], ["wonder", 0.017543859649122806], ["thought", 0.017543859649122806], ["story", 0.017543859649122806], ["takes", 0.017543859649122806], ["god", 0.017543859649122806], ["winning", 0.017543859649122806], ["going", 0.017543859649122806], ["drano", 0.017543859649122806], ["department", 0.017543859649122806], ["head", 0.017543859649122806], ["mixture", 0.017543859649122806], ["rueful", 0.017543859649122806], ["jekyll", 0.017543859649122806], ["hopes", 0.017543859649122806], ["dr", 0.017543859649122806], ["stuff", 0.017543859649122806], ["prize", 0.017543859649122806], ["drank", 0.017543859649122806], ["conducts", 0.017543859649122806], ["quiet", 0.017543859649122806], ["excitement", 0.017543859649122806], ["conversation", 0.017543859649122806], ["sadness", 0.017543859649122806], ["interrogate", 0.017543859649122806], ["time", 0.017543859649122806], ["chemistry", 0.017543859649122806]], "sentiment": ["JERRY: NO time to wonder that now.\nLEGHORN: Quiet now.

ago. Steve came to New York with everything he owned in an automobile, which he parked for two hours. Everything was stolen, of course. But then the damnedest thing in the history of crime happened: the police actually caught the thieves, and everything was returned to Steve only four hours after the theft. Did you ever hear of such a thing? God sure must love him.\nI love him, too\u2014but it seems to me that he is leading a dismayingly goofy life for a person his age. He claims to be a musician, but he does absolutely nothing to hustle his wares in the cities, where all the business is done. He is permanently on vacation, which is a spooky way to be. His friend Bob Sturgis was with him here. Sturgis is a very solid citizen these days, portly and grave, and a clerk to a New Jersey Supreme Court justice. Sturgis was raising hell with Steve, too, for remaining so dreamily child-like as the years roll by.\nA note from Jim says: \u201cThe last few months have been very bad goat-wise\u2014lots of sickness and death among the young kids. I think we will have it under control soon, but we have lost a lot.\u201d Too bad. At least he has inherited a new wad of cash, which should allow him to hang in there for another five years. I approve of that. It\u2019s somehow a very meaningful life he has.\nAnd you must know that I approve of your life, too. That heavy schedule will teach you a lot of skills you\u2019ll be glad to know. Skills are magical, or I always think so anyway, whenever I see people who have them. You say you are having an identity crisis. Well, the people who seem to have the strongest senses of identity are persons who have real skills and do respectable work. It may be, though, that you would like to be comforted and enlightened by a psycho-therapist as well. That is O.K. with me. Almost everything depends on who the therapist is, though. This is a matter of luck. Martha helped me tremendously, and at very low cost, mainly by putting me in a group. Somebody else might have wrecked me. If you do go to somebody, the therapist, no matter who it is, is going to want you to talk a lot about your feelings about all the members of your family\u2014how we all seemed to you when you were little. We probably seem that way to you now. The super shock to our family, and one of the best things that happened to it, too, was the arrival of the Adams. Your importance in the family was vastly increased, since there were suddenly so many new people for Jane and me to pay attention to. So you and I are not as close as we might have been. Or, we\u2019re just as close, I guess, but we don\u2019t know each other as well. Well, what the hell\u2014we know the Adams better than we would have otherwise, and that\u2019s a gain which may compensate for the loss. At any rate, we have all had more pleasant and interesting and affectionate lives than most people have. Nobody has anything much to regret or apologize for.\nYou and I know each other in our bones, at any rate. And you can get to know me some through my books, too. It is only natural that you should feel reserved and insecure when you\u2019re with me, since I\u2019ve caused two huge disruptions in the continuity of the family, and since you saw so much of me when I worked at home, when I had to raise such hell in order to gain privacy in which to write. Also, I was worried sick about money all the time, and I had no friends on Cape Cod who had any idea what my sort of work entailed. Just to clarify the two disruptions I\u2019m talking about, I mean the adoption of the Adams and my leaving the Cape for New York.\nSo there we are.\nI don\u2019t welcome at all the news that you won\u2019t be coming east again for a long time. That is going to be hard to take for all of us who love you so much, even if some of us don\u2019t know you as well as we should. Again, it\u2019s natural for someone your age to announce that she is cutting ties with the past, but don\u2019t really do that.\nI am taking the liberty of writing a young man in Oakland about you. He was a student of mine at Harvard, a pleasant and brilliant boy from good old Indiana. His name is Jerry Hiatt. I hope you hear from him.

The original stuff was made out of mushrooms, walnuts, and a lot of other things. It all started in Malaya. Catchup means \u2018taste\u2019 in Malaya. Not many people know that.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, good night.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t get around to calling Harry until several weeks later, when a prospective client, a Mr. Arthur J.
