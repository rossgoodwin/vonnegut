of medical education for Cook County Hospital in Chicago, he invited Vonnegut to speak to his staff of young doctors, feeling they would benefit from hearing people with interesting ideas outside the field of medicine. Dr. Maslansky was pleasantly surprised when Kurt said he would be glad to do it, and when asked what his lecture fee would be, his answer was, \u201cLunch.\u201d That was it. Vonnegut \u201ccame and spoke and was perfectly delightful,\u201d Maslansky recalled. When Dr. Maslansky moved to New York to be medical director of addiction and rehabilitation at Bellevue Hospital, he looked up Kurt, and they became friends.\nIn Fates Worse Than Death, Vonnegut wrote of his friend: \u201cDr. Robert Maslansky, who treats every sort of addict at Bellevue Hospital, in New York City, and in the jails, too, is a saint.\u201d\nIgnaz Semmelweis was an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures; he discovered that hand-washing by physicians reduced infant mortality in the Vienna General Hospital\u2019s obstetrics clinic in 1847, but some doctors were offended and rejected his theory.\nDear Bob\u2014\nWhat I hope I said about poetry was that I was unlikely to get the most out of it if I did not know the poet. I need the poet himself or herself as footnotes and appendix\u2014usually. Poets I have known are James Tate and George Starbuck and L.E. Sissman and Marvin Bell and Robert Penn Warren and Bill Meredith and a few others. This is nothing but laziness on my part. Greatness can get the attention of even this sleepy soul, however. Example: William Blake. There is no chance that I could ever respond warmly to upper class sensibilities, no matter how brilliantly expressed. This is politics. Example: T.S. Eliot. Fuck him. Everybody knows he\u2019s from St. Louis\u2014everybody but him.\nIf a friend, which you surely are, shows me a poem he or she likes a lot, which you have done, then, for me, that is just like knowing the poet. For me, poems are presents to be exchanged within an extended family.\nAs for Oak Ridge: the United States Army in its wisdom sent me to the University of Tennessee for a semester, to make me a mechanical engineer (Mechanics, A, Thermodynamics, F, Calculus, C)\u2014before sending me overseas as a rifleman. I had never had infantry basic training, by the way. I was an artilleryman, and had never thrown a hand grenade or fired anything but a carbine or a .45. It didn\u2019t matter.

I did not ask Alexei about them, because I knew he would tell me what fine times we would have on such places. I found out for myself in the library that the moon and the planets were not fit places for men or for any life. They were much too hot or much too cold or much too poisonous.\nI said nothing at home about my discoveries at the library, because I did not wish to be laughed at again. I waited quietly for Stepan to visit us. He would not laugh at my questions. He would answer them scientifically. He had worked on rockets for years. He would know everything that was known about space.\nStepan at last came to visit us, and brought his beautiful wife. He was a small man, but strong and broad and wise. He was very tired. His eyes were sunken. He knew already that he was to be shot into space. First had come the baby moon with the radio. Next had come the baby moon with the dog. Next would come the baby moons with the monkeys and the apes. After them would come the baby moon with Stepan. Stepan had been working night and day, designing his home in space. He could not tell me. He could not even tell his wife.\nMr. Ashland, you would have liked my son. Everybody liked Stepan. He was a man of peace. He was not a major because he was a great warrior. He was a major because he understood rockets so well. He was a thoughtful man. He often said that he wished that he could be a stone mason like me. He said a stone mason would have time and peace in which to think things out. I did not tell him that a stone mason thinks of little but stones and mortar.\nI asked him my questions about space, and he did not laugh. Stepan was very serious when he answered me. He had reason to be serious. He was telling me why he was himself willing to suffer in space.\nHe told me I was right. A man would suffer greatly in space, and the moon and the planets were bad places for men. There might be good places, but they were too far for men to reach in a lifetime.\n\"Then, what is this great new Age of Space, Stepan?\" I asked him.\n\"It will be an age of baby moons for a long time,\" he said. \"We will reach the moon itself soon, but it would be very difficult to stay there more than a few hours.\"\n\"Then why go into space, if there is so little good out there?\" I asked him.\n\"There is so much to be learned and seen out there,\" he said. \"A man could look at other worlds without a curtain of air between himself and them. A man could look at his own world, study the flow of weather over it, measure its true dimensions.\" This last surprised me. I thought the dimensions of our world were well known. \"A man out there could learn much about the wonderful showers of matter and energy in space,\" said Stepan. And he spoke of many other poetic and scientific joys out there.", 0.16837787956091524], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
