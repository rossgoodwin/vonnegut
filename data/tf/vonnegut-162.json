Two hundred acres is all, and he\u2019d have to cut down the windbreaks to connect it with other fields so he could farm it efficiently. Then the heirs found out that they couldn\u2019t have sold it to the Farm System anyway.

home instead of my car, so I could deliver the old filing cabinet to Grace. Anne was already inside the McClellan house, and George came out to give me a hand.\nThe cabinet was an old-fashioned oak monster, and, with all the sweating and grunting, I didn\u2019t really pay much attention to the house until we\u2019d put down our burden in the front hall.\nThe first thing I noticed was that there were already two dilapidated filing cabinets in the hall, ungraced by wallpaper or clear shellac. I looked into the living room. Anne was sitting on the couch with a queer smile on her face. The couch springs had burst through the bottom and were resting nakedly on the floor. The chief illumination came from a single light bulb in a cobwebbed chandelier with sockets for six. An electric extension cord, patched with friction tape, hung from another of the sockets and led to an iron on an ironing board in the middle of the living room.\nA small throw rug, the type generally seen in bathrooms, was the only floor covering, and the planks of the floor were scarred and dull from long neglect. Dust and cobwebs were everywhere, and the windows were dirty. The only sign of order or opulence was on the coffee table, where dozens of fat, slick decoration magazines were spread out like a fan.\nGeorge was nervous and more taciturn than usual, and I gathered that he was uneasy about having us in. After mixing us drinks, he sat down and maintained a fidgeting silence.\nNot so with Grace. She was at a high pitch of excitement, and, seemingly, full of irrepressible pride. Sitting, rising, and sitting again a dozen times a minute, she did a sort of ballet about the room, describing exactly the way she was going to do the room over. She rubbed imaginary fabrics between her fingers, stretched out luxuriously in a wicker chair that would one day be a plum-colored chaise longue, held her hands as far apart as she could reach to indicate the span of a limed-oak television-radio-phonograph console that was to stand against one wall.\nShe clapped her hands and closed her eyes. \"Can you see it? Can you see it?\"\n\"Simply lovely,\" said Anne.\n\"And every night, just as George is coming up the walk, I\u2019ll have Martinis ready in a frosty pewter pitcher, and I\u2019ll have a record playing on the phonograph.\" Grace knelt before the thin air where the console would be, selected a record from nothingness, put it on the imaginary turntable, pressed a non-existent button, and retired to the wicker chair. To my dismay, she began to rock her head back and forth in time to the phantom music.\nAfter a minute of this, George seemed disturbed, too. \"Grace! You\u2019re going to sleep.\" He tried to make his tone light, but real concern showed through.", 0.046736961451247165], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["meat", 0.06578947368421052], ["war", 0.039473684210526314], ["years", 0.039473684210526314], ["soul", 0.039473684210526314], ["things", 0.02631578947368421], ["will", 0.02631578947368421], ["tube", 0.02631578947368421], ["bad", 0.02631578947368421], ["control", 0.013157894736842105], ["responsible", 0.013157894736842105], ["retired", 0.013157894736842105], ["impossibly", 0.013157894736842105], ["joking", 0.013157894736842105], ["people", 0.013157894736842105], ["neon", 0.013157894736842105], ["mine", 0.013157894736842105], ["young", 0.013157894736842105], ["embarrassed", 0.013157894736842105], ["dumb", 0.013157894736842105], ["thought", 0.013157894736842105], ["dorothy", 0.013157894736842105], ["happening", 0.013157894736842105], ["hate", 0.013157894736842105], ["help", 0.013157894736842105], ["undisciplined", 0.013157894736842105], ["jerk", 0.013157894736842105], ["forgetting", 0.013157894736842105], ["fifty", 0.013157894736842105], ["god", 0.013157894736842105], ["separate", 0.013157894736842105], ["gentleman", 0.013157894736842105], ["three", 0.013157894736842105], ["imagined", 0.013157894736842105], ["fought", 0.013157894736842105], ["babies", 0.013157894736842105], ["laughed", 0.013157894736842105], ["flexible", 0.013157894736842105], ["hope", 0.013157894736842105], ["told", 0.013157894736842105], ["poor", 0.013157894736842105], ["blanks", 0.013157894736842105], ["catsup", 0.013157894736842105], ["fatherly", 0.013157894736842105], ["centered", 0.013157894736842105], ["men", 0.013157894736842105], ["sort", 0.013157894736842105], ["regular", 0.013157894736842105], ["lives", 0.013157894736842105], ["half", 0.013157894736842105], ["included", 0.013157894736842105], ["news", 0.013157894736842105], ["nineteen", 0.013157894736842105], ["kitchen", 0.013157894736842105], ["receive", 0.013157894736842105], ["inside", 0.013157894736842105], ["youth", 0.013157894736842105], ["movies", 0.013157894736842105], ["person", 0.013157894736842105], ["predicted", 0.013157894736842105], ["mature", 0.013157894736842105], ["marrying", 0.013157894736842105], ["military", 0.013157894736842105]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThat\u2019s what the young people will think our war was fifty years from now,\u201d said Kitchen, \u201cold men and blanks and catsup.\u201d So they would.

This makes writing seem exciting and relevant.\nIt takes about two years for a student to show important changes in his ability to write.
