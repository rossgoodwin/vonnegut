They arrived in America from Italy, not knowing each other, in Nineteen-hundred and Eight. It was the same year in which my parents arrived.\nFather was nineteen. Mother was twenty-one.\nSacco was seventeen. Vanzetti was twenty. American employers at that time wanted the country to be flooded with labor that was cheap and easily cowed, so that they could keep wages down.\nVanzetti would say later, \u201cIn the immigration station, I had my first surprise. I saw the steerage passengers handled by the officials like so many animals. Not a word of kindness, of encouragement, to lighten the burden of tears that rest heavily upon the newly arrived on American shores.\u201d\nFather and Mother used to tell me much the same thing. They, too, were made to feel like fools who had somehow gone to great pains to deliver themselves to a slaughterhouse.\nMy parents were recruited at once by an agent of the Cuyahoga Bridge and Iron Company in Cleveland. He was instructed to hire only blond Slavs, Mr. McCone once told me, on his father\u2019s theory that blonds would have the mechanical ingenuity and robustness of Germans, but tempered with the passivity of Slavs. The agent was to pick up factory workers, and a few presentable domestic servants for the various McCone households, as well. Thus did my parents enter the servant class.\nSacco and Vanzetti were not so lucky. There was no broker in human machinery who had a requisition for shapes like theirs. \u201cWhere was I to go? What was I to do?\u201d wrote Vanzetti. \u201cHere was the promised land. The elevated rattled by and did not answer. The automobiles and the trolleys sped by heedless of me.\u201d So he and Sacco, still separately and in order not to starve to death, had to begin at once to beg in broken English for any sort of work at any wage\u2014going from door to door.\nTime passed.\nSacco, who had been a shoemaker in Italy, found himself welcome in a shoe factory in Milford, Massachusetts, a town where, as chance would have it, Mary Kathleen O\u2019Looney\u2019s mother was born. Sacco got himself a wife and a house with a garden. They had a son named Dante and a daughter named Inez. Sacco worked six days a week, ten hours each day. He also found time to speak out and give money and take part in demonstrations for workers on strike for better wages and more humane treatment at work and so on.

Anyone who finds himself obliged, in the course of a history, to describe the war between Earth and Mars is humbled by the realization that the tale has already been told to glorious perfection by Rumfoord.\nThe usual course for such a discomfited historian is to describe the war in the barest, flattest, most telegraphic terms, and to recommend that the reader go at once to Rumfoord\u2019s masterpiece.\nSuch a course is followed here.\nThe war between Mars and Earth lasted 67 Earthling days.\nEvery nation on Earth was attacked.\nEarth\u2019s casualties were 461 killed, 223 wounded, none captured, and 216 missing.\nMars\u2019 casualties were 149,315 killed, 446 wounded, 11 captured, and 46,634 missing.", 0.06785714285714287], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["papa", 0.03225806451612903], ["san", 0.021505376344086023], ["siren", 0.021505376344086023], ["limousine", 0.021505376344086023], ["song", 0.021505376344086023], ["devil", 0.021505376344086023], ["monzano", 0.021505376344086023], ["plane", 0.021505376344086023], ["blood", 0.021505376344086023], ["franklin", 0.010752688172043012], ["crowd", 0.010752688172043012], ["limp", 0.010752688172043012], ["crushing", 0.010752688172043012], ["living", 0.010752688172043012], ["states", 0.010752688172043012], ["death", 0.010752688172043012], ["1922", 0.010752688172043012], ["63", 0.010752688172043012], ["reviewing", 0.010752688172043012], ["fuselage", 0.010752688172043012], ["glossy", 0.010752688172043012], ["aamons", 0.010752688172043012], ["melody", 0.010752688172043012], ["constrictor", 0.010752688172043012], ["approaching", 0.010752688172043012], ["row", 0.010752688172043012], ["gnat", 0.010752688172043012], ["reverent", 0.010752688172043012], ["united", 0.010752688172043012], ["stood", 0.010752688172043012], ["silent", 0.010752688172043012], ["national", 0.010752688172043012], ["anthem", 0.010752688172043012], ["childish", 0.010752688172043012], ["bokonon", 0.010752688172043012], ["fingers", 0.010752688172043012], ["adopted", 0.010752688172043012], ["written", 0.010752688172043012], ["pitchfork", 0.010752688172043012], ["lorenzo", 0.010752688172043012], ["imperious", 0.010752688172043012], ["cadillac", 0.010752688172043012], ["black", 0.010752688172043012], ["lionel", 0.010752688172043012], ["hoenikker", 0.010752688172043012], ["red", 0.010752688172043012], ["nose", 0.010752688172043012], ["daughter", 0.010752688172043012], ["boyd", 0.010752688172043012], ["painted", 0.010752688172043012], ["satanic", 0.010752688172043012], ["free", 0.010752688172043012], ["driven", 0.010752688172043012], ["signal", 0.010752688172043012], ["mouth", 0.010752688172043012], ["boa", 0.010752688172043012], ["propeller", 0.010752688172043012], ["nagging", 0.010752688172043012], ["range", 0.010752688172043012], ["smoking", 0.010752688172043012], ["pilot", 0.010752688172043012], ["tumid", 0.010752688172043012], ["lust", 0.010752688172043012], ["land", 0.010752688172043012], ["fighter", 0.010752688172043012], ["colored", 0.010752688172043012], ["johnson", 0.010752688172043012], ["mona", 0.010752688172043012], ["tires", 0.010752688172043012], ["climbed", 0.010752688172043012], ["grand", 0.010752688172043012], ["oatmeal", 0.010752688172043012], ["side", 0.010752688172043012], ["lorenzan", 0.010752688172043012], ["sang", 0.010752688172043012], ["slipping", 0.010752688172043012], ["stand", 0.010752688172043012], ["planes", 0.010752688172043012], ["military", 0.010752688172043012], ["ears", 0.010752688172043012], ["assistance", 0.010752688172043012], ["silence", 0.010752688172043012], ["left", 0.010752688172043012]], "sentiment": ["63\nREVERENT AND FREE\nTO THE LEFT SIDE of our reviewing stand were six propeller-driven fighter planes in a row, military assistance from the United States to San Lorenzo.

A pitchfork was slipping from satanic red fingers.\nBefore each plane stood an oatmeal-colored pilot; silent, too.\nThen, above that tumid silence, there came a nagging song like the song of a gnat.

It was the same gambit every time\u2014the men were to see the guns. Years ago, Anita had made the mistake of saying she was interested in guns, too. Kroner had politely told her that his weren\u2019t the kind women liked.\nMom\u2019s response was always the same, too: \u201cOh guns\u2014I hate them. I can\u2019t see why men want to go around shooting sweet little animals.\u201d\nThe fact was, Kroner never fired his guns. His pleasure seemed to be in owning and handling them. He also used them for props, to give an air of informality to his man-to-man talks. He announced raises and promotions, demotions and firings, and praised or warned, always in seemingly casual asides made while swabbing a bore.\nPaul followed him into the dark-paneled study, and waited for him to choose his weapon from the gunrack that filled one wall. Kroner ran his index finger along the collection, like a stick along a picket fence. It had been a matter of speculation among Kroner\u2019s underlings as to whether there was any significance in the guns he chose for a particular discussion. For a while the rumor was current that shotguns were bad news, rifles were good news. But it hadn\u2019t withstood the test of time. Kroner finally chose a ten-gauge shot-gun, broke open the breach, and squinted through the bore at a streetlight outside.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t dare shoot modern ammunition in this one,\u201d said Kroner. \u201cTwist barrel\u2014thing\u2019d go all to pieces.

"sentiment": ["\"Yeah\u2014?\"\n\"As though some marvelous new phase of my life were about to begin.\"\n\"That must be nice.\"\n\"It is! It is!\"\nAnd that continued to be Eliot's mood as he sauntered to the Saw City Kandy Kitchen. The aspect of the street was unnaturally quiet, as though a gun fight were expected, but Eliot did not notice this. The town was certain he was leaving forever. Those most dependent on Eliot had heard the click as clearly as they would have heard a cannon shot. There had been a lot of frantic, lame-brained planning of an appropriate farewell\u2014a firemen's parade, a demonstration with placards saying the things that most needed saying, a triumphal arch of water from fire hoses. The plans had all collapsed. There was no one to organize such a thing, to lead. Most were so eviscerated by the prospect of Eliot's leaving that they could not find the energy or bravery to stand at the rear of a large crowd, even, and feebly wave bye-bye. They knew the street down which he would walk. From that most fled.\nEliot left the afternoon dazzle of the sidewalk for the humid shade of the Parthenon, strolled along the canal. A retired saw-maker, a man about the Senator's age, was fishing with a bamboo pole. He was seated on a camp stool. A transistor radio was on the pavement between his high shoes. The radio was playing \"Ol' Man River.\" \"Darkies all work,\" it said, \"while the white folks play.\"\nThe old man wasn't a drunk or a pervert or anything. He was simply old, and a widower, and shot full of cancer, and his son in the Strategic Air Command never wrote, and his personality wasn't much. Booze upset him. The Rosewater Foundation had given him a grant for morphine, which his doctor prescribed.\nEliot greeted him, found he could not remember his name, nor what his trouble was. Eliot filled his lungs. It was too fine a day for sad things anyway.\nAt the far end of the Parthenon, which was a tenth of a mile long, was a small stand that sold shoelaces, razor-blades, soft drinks, and copies of The American Investigator. It was run by a man named Lincoln Ewald, who had been an ardent Nazi sympathizer during the Second World War. During that war, Ewald had set up a shortwave transmitter, in order to tell the Germans what was being produced by the Rosewater Saw Company every day, which was paratroop knives and armor plate. His first message, and the Germans hadn't asked him for any messages at all, was to the effect that, if they could bomb Rosewater, the entire American economy would shrivel and die. He didn't ask for money in exchange for the information. He sneered at money, said that that was why he hated America, because money was king. He wanted an Iron Cross, which he requested be sent in a plain wrapper.\nHis message was received loud and clear on the walkie-talkies of two game wardens in Turkey Run State Park, forty-two miles away. The wardens spilled the beans to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who arrested Ewald at the address to which the Iron Cross was to be sent. He was put in a mental institution until the war was over.", 0.08281001003827085], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["edison", 0.05319148936170213], ["dogs", 0.0425531914893617], ["bullard", 0.031914893617021274], ["sparky", 0.031914893617021274], ["stranger", 0.031914893617021274], ["smarter", 0.02127659574468085], ["dog", 0.02127659574468085], ["silence", 0.02127659574468085], ["thomas", 0.010638297872340425], ["torn", 0.010638297872340425], ["forget", 0.010638297872340425], ["dictionary", 0.010638297872340425], ["people", 0.010638297872340425], ["days", 0.010638297872340425], ["intelligence", 0.010638297872340425], ["rest", 0.010638297872340425], ["years", 0.010638297872340425], ["satisfaction", 0.010638297872340425], ["talked", 0.010638297872340425], ["esteem", 0.010638297872340425], ["year", 0.010638297872340425], ["garters", 0.010638297872340425], ["rewarded", 0.010638297872340425], ["arm", 0.010638297872340425], ["market", 0.010638297872340425], ["cotton", 0.010638297872340425], ["lie", 0.010638297872340425], ["removed", 0.010638297872340425], ["stood", 0.010638297872340425], ["spoke", 0.010638297872340425], ["working", 0.010638297872340425], ["purple", 0.010638297872340425], ["carbonized", 0.010638297872340425], ["gentleman", 0.010638297872340425], ["handed", 0.010638297872340425], ["lamp", 0.010638297872340425], ["piece", 0.010638297872340425], ["sleeping", 0.010638297872340425], ["triumphantly", 0.010638297872340425], ["destroy", 0.010638297872340425], ["ancestor", 0.010638297872340425], ["thousands", 0.010638297872340425], ["filament", 0.010638297872340425], ["stock", 0.010638297872340425], ["roared", 0.010638297872340425], ["play", 0.010638297872340425], ["good", 0.010638297872340425], ["door", 0.010638297872340425], ["tucked", 0.010638297872340425], ["sir", 0.010638297872340425], ["gathered", 0.010638297872340425], ["analyzer", 0.010638297872340425], ["hundreds", 0.010638297872340425], ["death", 0.010638297872340425], ["listening", 0.010638297872340425], ["wealthy", 0.010638297872340425], ["bulb", 0.010638297872340425], ["hold", 0.010638297872340425], ["day", 0.010638297872340425], ["hogwash", 0.010638297872340425], ["independently", 0.010638297872340425], ["shouted", 0.010638297872340425], ["word", 0.010638297872340425], ["thread", 0.010638297872340425], ["bits", 0.010638297872340425], ["light", 0.010638297872340425], ["work", 0.010638297872340425], ["1953", 0.010638297872340425], ["quiet", 0.010638297872340425], ["walked", 0.010638297872340425], ["face", 0.010638297872340425], ["solemn", 0.010638297872340425], ["token", 0.010638297872340425], ["night", 0.010638297872340425], ["small", 0.010638297872340425], ["slaving", 0.010638297872340425], ["book", 0.010638297872340425], ["pack", 0.010638297872340425]], "sentiment": ["\" \u2019Mr. Edison,\u2019 I said, \u2019do you mean to tell me that dogs are smarter than people?\u2019\n\" \u2019Smarter?\u2019 said Edison. \u2019I\u2019ll tell the world!

South Korea for forming a union of university students which demanded improvements in the curricula.\nGirolamo Savonarola, incidentally, was hanged and burned in the piazza in front of what had been the Palazzo of Innocenzo \u201cthe Invisible\u201d de Medici in 1494.\nI sure love history. I don\u2019t know why Celeste and her friends aren\u2019t more interested.\nI now think of the rotunda of that palazzo, when it still had its pagan as well as its Christian images, as a Renaissance effort to make an atom bomb. It cost a great deal of money and employed many of the best minds of the time, and it compressed into a small space and in bizarre combinations the most powerful forces of the Universe as the Universe was understood in the fifteenth century.\nThe Universe has certainly come a long, long way since then.\nAs for Innocenzo \u201cthe Invisible\u201d de Medici, according to Kim Bum Suk: he was a banker, which I choose to translate as \u201cloan shark and extortionist\u201d or \u201cgangster,\u201d in the parlance of the present day. He was simultaneously the richest and least public member of his family. No portrait of him was ever made, save for a bust done of him when a child by the sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti. He himself smashed that bust when he was fifteen years old, and threw the pieces into the Arno. He attended no parties and gave none when an adult, and never traveled in the city save in a conveyance which hid him from view.\nAfter his palazzo was completed, his most trusted henchmen and even the highest dignitaries, including two of his own cousins who were Popes, never saw him save in the rotunda. They were obliged to stand at the edge of it, while he alone occupied the middle\u2014wearing a shapeless monk\u2019s robe and a death\u2019s-head mask.\nHe drowned while in exile in Venice. This was long before the invention of water wings.\nWhen Marilee told me on the telephone to come over to her palazzo right away, the tone of her voice, coupled with her confession that there were no men in her life just then, seemed guarantees to me that in no more than two hours, probably, I would be getting more of the greatest loving I had ever had\u2014and not a callow youth this time, but as a war hero, rou\u00e9, and seasoned cosmopolite!\nI in turn warned her that I had lost an eye in battle, and so would be wearing an eye patch, and that I was married, yes, but that the marriage was on

How it was passed on to me is a mystery. By the time I got to know them, my parents were both so woozy with Weltschmerz that they weren\u2019t passing anything on\u2014not the German language, not their love for German music, not the family history, nothing. Everything was all over with. They were kaput.\nSo I must have questioned them, finally, about what our family believed. I must have noticed that the Goldsteins and the Waleses and others proudly believed one thing or another, and I wanted a belief to be proud of, too.\nHow proud I became of our belief, how pigheadedly proud, even, is the most evident thing in my writing, I think. Haven\u2019t I already attributed the breakup of my first marriage in part to my wife\u2019s failure to share my family belief with me?\nAnd did I not speak in this Free Thinking manner to the graduating class at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York, on May 26, 1974:\n\u201cKin Hubbard was an Indianapolis newspaper humorist. He wrote under the name of Abe Martin. My father, who was an Indianapolis architect, knew him some. Kin Hubbard had fault to find with commencement addresses. He thought that all the really important information should be spread out over four years, instead of being saved up for one big speech at the very end.\n\u201cThat is an elegant joke, although nobody here seems to be hemorrhaging with laughter. That is just as well. I want us to be serious. I want us to ponder seriously about commencement addresses, to realize what it is that is withheld from students until the very end. In the fiction game, we call a marvelous thing withheld until the very end the \u2019snapper\u2019 of a tale. O. Henry probably devised more snappers than any other writer in history. So what is the snapper of a college education? What is the thing colleges hire outsiders to deliver on commencement day?\n\u201cThe outsider is expected to answer the questions: what is life all about, and what are new college graduates supposed to do with it now?\n\u201cThis information has to be saved up until the very end for this good reason: No responsible, truth-loving teacher can answer those questions in class, or even in the privacy of his office or home. No respecter of evidence has ever found the least clue as to what life is all about, and what people should do with it.\n\u201cOh, there have been lots of brilliant guesses. But honest, educated people have to identify them as such\u2014as guesses. What are guesses worth? Scientifically and legally, they are not worth doodley-squat.

In Vietnam they would have been cartridge cases. This was where Arthur K. Clarke had formed up his motorcycle gang for its unopposed assault on Tarkington. The troops and their ladies had first drunk champagne. There were also remains of sandwiches, and I stepped on one, which I think was either cucumber or watercress. I scraped it off on the curbing, left it there for germs. I\u2019ll tell you this, though: No germ is going to leave the Solar System eating sissy stuff like that.\nPlutonium! Now there\u2019s the stuff to put hair on a microbe\u2019s chest.\nI ENTERED THE Black Cat Caf\u00e9 for the first time in my life. This was my club now, since I had been busted down to Townie. Maybe, after a few drinks, I\u2019d go back up the hill and let air out of the tires of some of Clarke\u2019s motorcycles and limousines.\nI bellied up to the bar and said, \u201cGive me a wop.\u201d That was what I had heard people down in the town called Budweiser beer, ever since Italians had bought Anheuser-Busch, the company that made Budweiser. The Italians got the St. Louis Cardinals, too, as part of the deal.\n\u201cWop coming up,\u201d said the barmaid. She was just the kind of woman I would go for right now, if I didn\u2019t have TB. She was in her late 30s, and had had a lot of bad luck recently, and didn\u2019t know where to turn next. I knew her story. So did everybody else in town. She and her husband restored an old-time ice cream parlor 2 doors up Clinton Street from the Black Cat Caf\u00e9. But then her husband died because he had inhaled so much paint remover. The germs inside him couldn\u2019t have felt too great, either.\nWHO KNOWS, THOUGH? The Elders of Tralfamadore may have had her husband restore the ice cream parlor just so we could have a new strain of germs capable of surviving a passage through a cloud of paint remover in outer space.\nHER NAME WAS Muriel Peck, and her husband Jerry Peck was a direct descendant of the first President of Tarkington College. His father grew up in this valley, but Jerry was raised in San Diego, California, and then he went to work for an ice cream company out there. The ice cream company was bought by President Mobutu of Zaire, and Jerry was let go. So he came here with Muriel and their 2 kids to discover his roots.\nSince he already knew ice cream, it made perfect sense for him to buy the old ice cream parlor. It would have been better for all concerned if he had known a little less about ice cream and a little more about paint remover.\nMURIEL AND I would eventually become lovers, but not until I had been working at Athena Prison for 2 weeks. I finally got nerve enough to ask her, since she and Jerry had both majored in Literature at Swarthmore College, if either of them had ever taken the time to read a label on a can of paint remover.\n\u201cNot until it was much too late,\u201d she said.", 0.060143269428983716], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["art", 0.03488372093023256], ["father", 0.029069767441860465], ["museum", 0.023255813953488372], ["cincinnati", 0.01744186046511628], ["crucifixion", 0.01744186046511628], ["ten", 0.01744186046511628], ["paintings", 0.01744186046511628], ["gunther", 0.01744186046511628], ["hitler", 0.01744186046511628], ["wanted", 0.01744186046511628], ["died", 0.01744186046511628], ["remember", 0.01744186046511628], ["rome", 0.01744186046511628], ["years", 0.011627906976744186], ["bought", 0.011627906976744186], ["rettig", 0.011627906976744186], ["size", 0.011627906976744186], ["vienna", 0.011627906976744186], ["head", 0.011627906976744186], ["john", 0.011627906976744186], ["holland", 0.011627906976744186], ["marketplace", 0.011627906976744186], ["collection", 0.011627906976744186], ["greatest", 0.011627906976744186], ["mother", 0.011627906976744186], ["fact", 0.011627906976744186], ["money", 0.005813953488372093], ["retire", 0.005813953488372093], ["rest", 0.005813953488372093], ["discovered", 0.005813953488372093], ["gauge", 0.005813953488372093], ["advertised", 0.005813953488372093], ["imagined", 0.005813953488372093], ["police", 0.005813953488372093], ["adolf", 0.005813953488372093], ["concerned", 0.005813953488372093], ["finally", 0.005813953488372093], ["threescore", 0.005813953488372093], ["east", 0.005813953488372093], ["thousands", 0.005813953488372093], ["worth", 0.005813953488372093], ["ludicrous", 0.005813953488372093], ["appointment", 0.005813953488372093], ["song", 0.005813953488372093], ["big", 0.005813953488372093], ["morissey", 0.005813953488372093], ["killed", 0.005813953488372093], ["nude", 0.005813953488372093], ["accidentally", 0.005813953488372093], ["benefit", 0.005813953488372093], ["furnishing", 0.005813953488372093], ["people", 0.005813953488372093], ["house", 0.005813953488372093], ["church", 0.005813953488372093], ["born", 0.005813953488372093], ["year", 0.005813953488372093], ["pictures", 0.005813953488372093], ["motel", 0.005813953488372093], ["forty", 0.005813953488372093], ["biloxi", 0.005813953488372093], ["progress", 0.005813953488372093], ["learned", 0.005813953488372093], ["told", 0.005813953488372093], ["europe", 0.005813953488372093], ["blowing", 0.005813953488372093], ["august", 0.005813953488372093], ["hundreds", 0.005813953488372093], ["volendam", 0.005813953488372093], ["1932", 0.005813953488372093], ["studio", 0.005813953488372093], ["francis", 0.005813953488372093], ["care", 0.005813953488372093], ["successes", 0.005813953488372093], ["dollars", 0.005813953488372093], ["days", 0.005813953488372093], ["magazine", 0.005813953488372093], ["social", 0.005813953488372093], ["settled", 0.005813953488372093], ["hometown", 0.005813953488372093], ["prosecuting", 0.005813953488372093], ["owned", 0.005813953488372093], ["hangs", 0.005813953488372093], ["wasn", 0.005813953488372093], ["lesson", 0.005813953488372093], ["city", 0.005813953488372093], ["mississippi", 0.005813953488372093], ["collectors", 0.005813953488372093], ["midland", 0.005813953488372093], ["liquidated", 0.005813953488372093], ["cared", 0.005813953488372093], ["secret", 0.005813953488372093], ["greatness", 0.005813953488372093], ["believing", 0.005813953488372093], ["waste", 0.005813953488372093], ["dogs", 0.005813953488372093], ["sort", 0.005813953488372093], ["painted", 0.005813953488372093], ["treasures", 0.005813953488372093], ["baby", 0.005813953488372093], ["metzgers", 0.005813953488372093], ["evident", 0.005813953488372093], ["work", 0.005813953488372093], ["war", 0.005813953488372093], ["felix", 0.005813953488372093], ["sleeping", 0.005813953488372093], ["tiny", 0.005813953488372093], ["native", 0.005813953488372093], ["lie", 0.005813953488372093], ["shirt", 0.005813953488372093], ["thing", 0.005813953488372093], ["pay", 0.005813953488372093], ["stayed", 0.005813953488372093], ["cardboard", 0.005813953488372093], ["experienced", 0.005813953488372093], ["curators", 0.005813953488372093], ["deathbed", 0.005813953488372093], ["student", 0.005813953488372093], ["minorite", 0.005813953488372093], ["man", 0.005813953488372093], ["ago", 0.005813953488372093], ["shotgun", 0.005813953488372093], ["sale", 0.005813953488372093], ["thought", 0.005813953488372093], ["chief", 0.005813953488372093], ["serious", 0.005813953488372093], ["painting", 0.005813953488372093], ["order", 0.005813953488372093]], "sentiment": ["Waste not, want not.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAs far as I know, he had only one big secret which he might have told on his deathbed: Who killed August Gunther, and what became of Gunther\u2019s head. But he didn\u2019t tell it. Who would have cared? Would there have been any social benefit in prosecuting old Francis X. Morissey, who had become chief of police and was about to retire, for accidentally blowing Gunther\u2019s head off with a ten-gauge shotgun forty-four years ago?\nLet sleeping dogs lie.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen Felix and I got to Father, he was a baby again. He thought his mother was somewhere around. He died believing that he had once owned one of the ten greatest paintings in the world. This wasn\u2019t \u201cThe Minorite Church of Vienna\u201d by Adolf Hitler. Father had nothing to say about Hitler as he died. He had learned his lesson about Hitler. One of the ten greatest paintings in the world, as far as he was concerned, was \u201cCrucifixion in Rome,\u201d by John Rettig, which he had bought for a song in Holland, during his student days. It now hangs in the Cincinnati Art Museum.\n\u201cCrucifixion in Rome,\u201d in fact, was one of the few successes in the art marketplace, or in any sort of marketplace, which Father experienced in his threescore years and eight. When he and Mother had to put up all their treasures for sale, in order to pay off the Metzgers, they had imagined that their paintings alone were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. They advertised in an art magazine, I remember, that an important art collection was to be liquidated, and that serious collectors and museum curators could see it by appointment in our house.\nAbout five people did come all the way to Midland City for a look, I remember, and found the collection ludicrous. One man, I remember, wanted a hundred pictures for a motel he was furnishing in Biloxi, Mississippi. The rest really seemed to know and care about art.\nBut the only painting anybody wanted was \u201cCrucifixion in Rome.\u201d The Cincinnati Art Museum bought it for not much money, and the museum wanted it not because its greatness was so evident, I\u2019m sure, but because it had been painted by a native of Cincinnati.

The others went looking for souvenirs. Later on in life, the Tralfamadorians would advise Billy to concentrate on the happy moments of his life, and to ignore the unhappy ones\u2014to stare only at pretty things as eternity failed to go by. If this sort of selectivity had been possible for Billy, he might have chosen as his happiest moment his sundrenched snooze in the back of the wagon.\nBilly Pilgrim was armed as he snoozed. It was the first time he had been armed since basic training. His companions had insisted that he arm himself, since God only knew what sorts of killers might be in burrows on the face of the moon\u2014wild dogs, packs of rats fattened on corpses, escaped maniacs and murderers, soldiers who would never quit killing until they themselves were killed.\nBilly had a tremendous cavalry pistol in his belt. It was a relic of World War One. It had a ring in its butt. It was loaded with bullets the size of robins\u2019 eggs. Billy had found it in the bedside table in a house. That was one of the things about the end of the war: Absolutely anybody who wanted a weapon could have one. They were lying all around. Billy had a saber, too. It was a Luftwaffe ceremonial saber. Its hilt was stamped with a screaming eagle. The eagle was carrying a swastika and looking down. Billy found it stuck into a telephone pole. He had pulled it out of the pole as the wagon went by.\nNow his snoozing became shallower as he heard a man and a woman speaking German in pitying tones. The speakers were commiserating with somebody lyrically. Before Billy opened his eyes, it seemed to him that the tones might have been those used by the friends of Jesus when they took His ruined body down from His cross. So it goes.\nBilly opened his eyes. A middle-aged man and wife were crooning to the horses. They were noticing what the Americans had not noticed\u2014that the horses\u2019 mouths were bleeding, gashed by the bits, that the horses\u2019 hooves were broken, so that every step meant agony, that the horses were insane with thirst. The Americans had treated their form of transportation as though it were no more sensitive than a six-cylinder Chevrolet.\nThese two horse pitiers moved back along the wagon to where they could gaze in patronizing reproach at Billy\u2014at Billy Pilgrim, who was so long and weak, so ridiculous in his azure toga and silver shoes. They weren\u2019t afraid of him. They weren\u2019t afraid of anything. They were doctors, both obstetricians. They had been delivering babies until the hospitals were all burned down. Now they were picnicking near where their apartment used to be.\nThe woman was softly beautiful, translucent from having eaten potatoes for so long. The man wore a business suit, necktie and all. Potatoes had made him gaunt. He was as tall as Billy, wore steel-rimmed trifocals. This couple, so involved with babies, had never reproduced themselves, though they could have. This was an interesting comment on the whole idea of reproduction.\nThey had nine languages between them. They tried Polish on Billy Pilgrim first, since he was dressed so clownishly, since the wretched Poles were the involuntary clowns of the Second World War.\nBilly asked them in English what it was they wanted, and they at once scolded him in English for the condition of the horses. They made Billy get out of the wagon and come look at the horses. When Billy saw the condition of his means of transportation, he burst into tears. He hadn\u2019t cried about anything else in the war.\nLater on, as a middle-aged optometrist, he would weep quietly and privately sometimes, but never make loud boohooing noises.", -0.02956349206349205], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["will", 0.10810810810810811], ["killed", 0.036036036036036036], ["father", 0.02702702702702703], ["kill", 0.018018018018018018], ["crying", 0.018018018018018018], ["fortune", 0.018018018018018018], ["told", 0.018018018018018018], ["blame", 0.018018018018018018], ["american", 0.018018018018018018], ["hatred", 0.018018018018018018], ["cat", 0.018018018018018018], ["thomas", 0.009009009009009009], ["cynthia", 0.009009009009009009], ["years", 0.009009009009009009], ["telling", 0.009009009009009009], ["committed", 0.009009009009009009], ["hate", 0.009009009009009009], ["find", 0.009009009009009009], ["redirect", 0.009009009009009009], ["taxicab", 0.009009009009009009], ["crime", 0.009009009009009009], ["heroism", 0.009009009009009009], ["belted", 0.009009009009009009], ["wouldn", 0.009009009009009009], ["demands", 0.009009009009009009], ["putting", 0.009009009009009009], ["mom", 0.009009009009009009], ["front", 0.009009009009009009], ["newcomb", 0.009009009009009009], ["child", 0.009009009009009009], ["motorcyclist", 0.009009009009009009], ["brother", 0.009009009009009009], ["arthur", 0.009009009009009009], ["radial", 0.009009009009009009], ["grotesquely", 0.009009009009009009], ["respond", 0.009009009009009009], ["seventeen", 0.009009009009009009], ["harold", 0.009009009009009009], ["dead", 0.009009009009009009], ["tires", 0.009009009009009009], ["year", 0.009009009009009009], ["waiting", 0.009009009009009009], ["anne", 0.009009009009009009], ["shut", 0.009009009009009009], ["booby", 0.009009009009009009], ["termite", 0.009009009009009009], ["stage", 0.009009009009009009], ["wilbur", 0.009009009009009009], ["receive", 0.009009009009009009], ["ill", 0.009009009009009009], ["soldier", 0.009009009009009009], ["commit", 0.009009009009009009], ["waitress", 0.009009009009009009], ["named", 0.009009009009009009], ["drove", 0.009009009009009009], ["hospital", 0.009009009009009009], ["long", 0.009009009009009009], ["eleven", 0.009009009009009009], ["live", 0.009009009009009009], ["white", 0.009009009009009009], ["lowest", 0.009009009009009009], ["buy", 0.009009009009009009], ["doctors", 0.009009009009009009], ["baby", 0.009009009009009009], ["atlanta", 0.009009009009009009], ["highest", 0.009009009009009009], ["steel", 0.009009009009009009], ["swindled", 0.009009009009009009], ["room", 0.009009009009009009], ["car", 0.009009009009009009], ["scenes", 0.009009009009009009], ["dollars", 0.009009009009009009], ["nurses", 0.009009009009009009], ["decoration", 0.009009009009009009], ["headley", 0.009009009009009009], ["hatch", 0.009009009009009009], ["bunny", 0.009009009009009009], ["medals", 0.009009009009009009], ["hoover", 0.009009009009009009], ["extremely", 0.009009009009009009], ["wheels", 0.009009009009009009], ["exterminators", 0.009009009009009009], ["man", 0.009009009009009009], ["disease", 0.009009009009009009], ["looked", 0.009009009009009009], ["mother", 0.009009009009009009], ["talk", 0.009009009009009009]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThey say I killed my baby.\u201d\nAnd so on.\nThis man, who was white, had all the medals Harold Newcomb Wilbur had, plus the highest decoration for heroism which an American soldier could receive, which looked like this:\nHe had now also committed the lowest crime which an American could commit, which was to kill his own child.
