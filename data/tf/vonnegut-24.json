mother could never tell reporters she was happy that her son\u2019s airplane had killed a world\u2019s record number of civilians all at once.\nTrout\u2019s story reminds me of the time my late great-aunt Emma Vonnegut said she hated the Chinese. Her late son-in-law Kerfuit Stewart, who used to own Stewart\u2019s Book Store in Louisville, Kentucky, admonished her that it was wicked to hate that many people all at once.\nWhatever.\nThe crewmen aboard Joy\u2019s Pride, at any rate, told the pilot on the intercom that they felt much as he did. They were all alone up there in the sky. They didn\u2019t need a fighter escort, since the Japanese didn\u2019t have any airlanes left. The war was over, except for the paperwork, arguably the situation even before Enola Gay cremated Hiroshima.\nTo quote Kilgore Trout: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t war anymore, and neither had been the obliteration of Nagasaki. This was \u2018Thanks to the Yanks for a job well done!\u2019 This was show biz now.\u201d\nTrout said in \u201cNo Laughing Matter\u201d that the pilot and his bombardier had felt somewhat godlike on previous missions, when they had had nothing more than incendiaries and conventional high explosives to drop on people. \u201cBut that was godlike with a little g,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey identified themselves with minor deities who only avenged and destroyed. Up there in the sky all alone, with the purple motherfucker slung underneath their plane, they felt like the Boss God Himself, who had an option which hadn\u2019t been theirs before, which was to be merciful.\u201d\nTrout himself had been in World War Two, but not as an airman and not in the Pacific. He had been a forward observer for the Army field artillery in Europe, a lieutenant with binoculars and a radio, up with the infantry or even ahead of it. He would tell batteries to the rear where their shrapnel or white phosphorus or whatever might help a lot.\nHe himself had certainly not been merciful, nor, by his own account, had he ever felt he should have been.

So Father had close friends who had been heroes on both sides of the war.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFather and Mother also bought the enormous weather vane from the gatehouse of the von Furstenberg estate, and put it atop their cupola back home, making the studio taller than anything in the county, except for the dome of the county courthouse, a few silos, the Fortunes\u2019 dairy barn, and the Midland County National Bank.\nThat weather vane was instantly the most famous work of art in Midland City. Its only competition was a statue of a Union soldier on foot in Fairchild Park. Its arrow alone was twelve feet long, and one hollow copper horseman chased another one down that awesome shaft. The one in back was an Austrian with a lance. The one in front, fleeing for his life, was a Turk with a scimitar.\nThis engine, swinging now toward Detroit, now toward Louisville, and so on, commemorated the lifting of the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683.\nWhen I was little, I asked my brother Felix, who is seven years older than I am, and who used to lie to me every chance he got, to explain to me and a playmate the significance of the weather vane.

liberties\u2014like freedom of speech, and a lot more. He supports the Second Amendment and explains how \u201cman-killing devices and live ammunition\u201d can best serve us.4\nThere is something you are entitled to know about me\u2014something I\u2019m not proud to confess. This is it: I was born into a society as segregated as Biloxi, Mississippi, except for the drinking fountains and the buses. And I am the product of a lily-white public high school in Indianapolis. It had a faculty worthy of a university. Our teachers there, again lily-white, weren\u2019t just teachers. They were their subjects. Our chemistry teachers were first and foremost chemists. Our physics teachers were first and foremost physicists. Our teacher of ancient history, who was Minnie Lloyd, should have been wearing medals for all she did at the Battle of Thermopylae. Our English teachers were very commonly serious writers. One of mine, the late Marguerite Young, went on to write the definitive biography of Indiana\u2019s own Eugene Victor Debs, the middle-class labor leader and socialist candidate for President of the United States, who died in 1926, when I was 4. Millions voted for Debs when he ran for President.\nI never met Debs, but I was old enough after World War II to have lunch in this city with another middle-class Indiana labor leader. He was Powers Hapgood. Although he was a Harvard graduate and from a well-to-do family of business people, Powers Hapgood worked as a coal miner to get close, both spiritually and physically, to those he wished to help to help themselves. He then became an officer in the CIO here in Indianapolis.\nNot long after our lunch, there was some kind of dust-up on a picket line, and he landed in court as a witness. The judge, Judge Claycomb, in fact the father of my Shortridge classmate Moon Claycomb, knew of Hapgood\u2019s history, and interrupted the proceedings to ask why such a privileged person would spend his life as he had. And Powers Hapgood replied: \u201cWhy, the Sermon on the Mount, sir.\u201d\nAnd if I am asked why anybody should support their local and national Civil Liberties Unions, I will say that it takes a powerful private organization to compel those who govern us to not to violate the crystal clear laws in the Bill of Rights, just as we would not want them to drive when drunk or park by a fireplug. Given the humane and fair and merciful intent of the Bill of Rights, what I would actually be saying, though, subliminally, is, \u201cThe Sermon on the Mount, sir or madam.\u201d\nIf you don\u2019t know what the Sermon on the Mount is, ask your kid\u2019s computer. If you don\u2019t know what the laws in the Bill of Rights are, look \u2019em up, look \u2019em up. And yes, I know about the Second Amendment, and I\u2019m for it. It doesn\u2019t say people who disagree with a President should shoot him, which is what John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald did. It says in effect that civilians interested in playing with man-killing devices and live ammunition can best serve the rest of us in the National Guard, as long as they don\u2019t shoot unarmed college students5.\nTo come back to my lily-white high school, which had a daily paper. It had such a stunning faculty because the Great Depression was going on, so teaching was a plum job for some of the smartest men in town. But even before the stock market crash of 1929, when I was 7, it had great teachers because teaching high school was virtually the only way brilliant and informed women could make effective use of their warmth and intellectual enthusiasm and giftedness. Most of my best teachers were women, and holy smokes, were they ever bright.\nWhy were women barred then from so many jobs they now hold with distinction? Because of what was then believed to be a law of Nature, a Natural Law. Otherwise, why would Nature have made women such lousy fighters? Most of \u2019em, with a very few strikingly unattractive exceptions, couldn\u2019t fight their way out of a paper bag.\nWhy were there no African-Americans in my high school?\nAfrican-Americans had their own high school, of course. It was Crispus Attucks. And because of the peculiar name of our black high school, people of all colors in Indianapolis were unusual Americans for knowing who Crispus Attucks was. He was an African-American free man, not a slave, who stopped a British bullet at the Boston Massacre in 1770, only six years before our nation became a beacon of liberty for the whole wide world. In one book of mine, I nicknamed Crispus Attucks High School \u201cInnocent Bystander High.\u201d", 0.19474055624740558], "title": "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["roy",

when talking to Roy, confident that he would perceive on his own that he had suffered a mild brain malfunction. But by March, Roy was out of his job, and Mary knew she was going to be let go in June. The timing of the cruise, anyway, became practical. And the cruise loomed huge in Roy\u2019s increasingly erratic imagination as \u201c\u2026 the only good thing we\u2019ve got to look forward to.\u201d\nHere was what had happened to their jobs: GEFFCo had furloughed almost its entire work force, blue-collar and white-collar alike, in order to modernize the Ilium operation. A Japanese company, Matsumoto, was doing the job. Matsumoto was also automating the Bah\u00eda de Darwin. This was the same company which employed *Zenji Hiroguchi, the young computer genius who would be staying with his wife at the Hotel El Dorado the same time that Mary was there.\nWhen the Matsumoto Corporation got through installing computers and robots, only twelve human beings would be able to run everything. So people young enough to have children, or at least ambitious dreams for the future, left town in droves. It was, as Mary Hepburn would say on her eighty-first birthday, two weeks before a great white shark ate her, \u201c\u2026 as though the Pied Piper had passed through town.\u201d Suddenly, there were almost no children to educate, and the city was bankrupt for want of taxpayers. So Ilium High School would graduate its last class in June.\nIn April Roy was diagnosed as having an inoperable brain tumor. \u201cThe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d thereupon became what he was staying alive for. \u201cI can hang on that long at least, Mary. November\u2014that\u2019s not far away, is it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI can hang on that long.\u201d\n\u201cYou could have years, Roy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cJust let me take that cruise,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me see penguins on the equator,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019ll be good enough for me.\u201d\nWhile Roy was mistaken about more and more things, he was right about there being penguins on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. They were skinny things underneath their headwaiters\u2019 costumes. They had to be. If they had been swaddled in fat like their relatives on the ice floes to the south, half a world away, they would have roasted to death when they came ashore on the lava to lay their eggs and tend their young.\nLike those of the flightless cormorants, their ancestors, too, had abandoned the glamor of aviation\u2014electing to catch more fish instead.", 0.16925353925353925], "title":

["Mamigonian became their most ardent advisor and protector, eager to find them a safe place for the jewels in a city notorious for its heartless thieves. But they had already put them in a bank.\nSo Mamigonian constructed a fantasy which he proposed to trade for the jewels. He must have found San Ignacio, California, in an atlas, since no Armenian had ever been there, and since no news of that sleepy farming town could have reached the Near East in any form. Mamigonian said he had a brother in San Ignacio. He forged letters from the brother to prove it. The letters said, moreover, that the brother had become extremely rich in a short time there. There were many other Armenians there, all doing well. They were looking for a teacher for their children who was fluent in Armenian and familiar with the great literature in that language.\nAs an inducement to such a teacher, they would sell him a house and twenty acres of fruit trees at a fraction of their true value. Mamigonian\u2019s \u201crich brother\u201d enclosed a photo of the house, and a deed to it as well.\nIf Mamigonian knew a good teacher in Cairo who might be interested, this nonexistent brother wrote, Mamigonian was authorized to sell him the deed. This would secure the teaching job for Father, and make him one of the larger property owners in idyllic San Ignacio.\n4\nI HAVE BEEN in the art business, the picture business, so long now that I can daydream about the past as though it were a vista through a series of galleries like the Louvre, perhaps\u2014home of the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d whose smile has now outlived by three decades the postwar miracle of Sateen Dura-Luxe. The pictures in what must be the final gallery of my life are real. I can touch them, if I like, or, following the recommendations of the widow Berman, a.k.a. \u201cPolly Madison,\u201d sell them to the highest bidder or in some other way, in her thoughtful words. \u201cGet them the hell out of here.\u201d\nIn the imaginary galleries in the distance are my own Abstract Expressionist paintings, miraculously resurrected by the Great Critic for Judgment Day, and then pictures by Europeans, which I bought for a few dollars or chocolate bars or nylon stockings when a soldier, and then advertisements of the sort I had been laying out and illustrating before I joined the Army\u2014at about the time news of my father\u2019s death in the Bijou Theater in San Ignacio came.\nStill farther away are the magazine illustrations of Dan Gregory, whose apprentice I was from the time I was seventeen until he threw me out. I was one month short of being twenty when he threw me out. Beyond the Dan Gregory Gallery are unframed works I made in my boyhood, as the only artist of any age or sort ever to inhabit San Ignacio.\nThe gallery at the farthest remove from me in my dotage, though, just inside the door I entered in 1916, is devoted to a photograph, not a painting. Its subject is a noble white house with a long winding driveway and porte-cochere, supposedly in San Ignacio, which Vartan Mamigonian in Cairo told my parents they were buying with most of Mother\u2019s jewelry.\nThat picture, along with a bogus deed, crawling with signatures and spattered with sealing wax, was in my parents\u2019 bedside table for many years\u2014in the tiny apartment over Father\u2019s shoe repair shop. I assumed that he had thrown them out with so many other mementos after Mother died. But as I was about to board a railroad train in 1933, to seek my fortune in New York City during the depths of the Great Depression, Father made me a present of the photograph. \u201cIf you happen to come across this house,\u201d he said in Armenian, \u201clet me know where it is. Wherever it is, it belongs to me.\u201d", 0.22736742424242426], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "a-man-without-a-country": {"tfidf": [["envelope", 0.022653721682847898], ["going", 0.019417475728155338],

it.\nDo you know what a Luddite is? A person who hates newfangled contraptions. Ned Ludd was a textile worker in England at around the start of the nineteenth century who busted up a lot of new contraptions\u2014mechanical looms that were going to put him out of work, that were going to make it impossible for him with his particular skills to feed, clothe, and shelter his family. In 1813 the British government executed by hanging seventeen men for \u201cmachine breaking,\u201d as it was called, a capital crime.\nToday we have contraptions like nuclear submarines armed with Poseidon missiles that have H-bombs in their warheads. And we have contraptions like computers that cheat you out of becoming. Bill Gates says, \u201cWait till you can see what your computer can become.\u201d But it\u2019s you who should be doing the becoming, not the damn fool computer. What you can become is the miracle you were born to be through the work that you do.\nProgress has beat the heck out of me. It took away from me what a loom must have been to Ned Ludd two hundred years ago. I mean a typewriter. There is no longer such a thing anywhere. Huckleberry Finn, incidentally, was the first novel ever to be typewritten.\nIn the old days, not long ago, I used to type. And, after I had about twenty pages, I would mark them up with a pencil, making corrections. Then I would call Carol Atkins, who was a typist. Can you imagine? She lived out in Woodstock, New York, which you know was where the famous sex and drugs event in the \u201960s got its name from (it actually took place in the nearby town of Bethel and anybody who says they remember being there wasn\u2019t there.) So, I would call up Carol and say, \u201cHey Carol. How are you doing? How is your back? Got any bluebirds?\u201d We would chit-chat back and forth\u2014I love to talk to people.\nShe and her husband had been trying to attract bluebirds, and as you know if you have tried to attract bluebirds, you put the bluebird house only three feet off the ground, usually on a fence along a property line. Why there are any bluebirds left I don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t have any luck, and neither did I, out at my place in the country. Anyway, we chat away, and finally I say, \u201cHey, you know I got some pages. Are you still typing?\u201d And she sure is. And I know it will be so neat, it will look like it was done by a computer. And I say, \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t get lost in the mail.\u201d And she says, \u201cNothing ever gets lost in the mail.\u201d And that in fact has been my experience. I never have lost anything. And so, she is a Ned Ludd now. Her typing is worthless.\nAnyway, I take my pages and I have this thing Anyway, made out of steel, it\u2019s called a paper clip, and I put my pages together, being careful to number them, too, of course. So I go downstairs, to take off, and I pass my wife, the photo journalist Jill Krementz, who was bloody high tech then, and is even higher tech now. She calls out, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Her favorite reading when she was a girl was Nancy Drew mysteries, you know, the girl detective. So she can\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d And I say, \u201cI am going out to get an envelope.\u201d And she says, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not a poor man. Why don\u2019t you buy a thousand envelopes? They\u2019ll deliver them, and you can put them in a closet.\u201d And I say, \u201cHush.\u201d\nSo I go down the steps, and this is on 48th Street in New York City between Second Avenue and Third, and I go out to this newsstand across the street where they sell magazines and lottery tickets and stationery. And I know their stock very well, and so I get an envelope, a manila envelope. It is as though whoever made that envelope knew what size of paper I\u2019m using. I get in line because there are people buying lottery tickets, candy, and that sort of thing, and I chat with them. I say, \u201cDo you know anybody who ever won anything in the lottery?\u201d And, \u201cWhat happened to your foot?\u201d\nFinally I get up to the head of the line. The people who own this store are Hindus. The woman behind the counter has a jewel between her eyes. Now isn\u2019t that worth the trip? I ask her, \u201cHave there been any big lottery winners lately?\u201d Then I pay for the envelope. I take my manuscript and I put it inside. The envelope has two little metal prongs for going through a hole in the flap. For those of you who have never seen one, there are two ways of closing a manila envelope. I use both of them. First I lick the mucilage\u2014it\u2019s kind of sexy. I put the little thin metal diddle through the hole\u2014I never did know what they call them. Then I glue the flap down.\nI go next to the postal convenience center down the block at the corner of 47th Street and Second Avenue. This is very close to the United Nations, so there are all these funny-looking people there from all over the world. I go in there and we are lined up again. I\u2019m secretly in love with the woman behind the counter. She doesn\u2019t know it. My wife knows it. I am not about to do anything about it. She is so nice. All I have ever seen of her is from the waist up because she is always behind the counter. But every day she will do something with herself above her waist to cheer us up. Sometimes her hair will be all frizzy. Sometimes she will have ironed it flat. One day she was wearing black lipstick. This is all so exciting and so generous of her, just to cheer us all up, people from all over the world.", 0.06080429292929294], "title": "A Man without a Country"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf":

and finally settled in Indianapolis in 1850. His father had been an official tax-collector for the Duke of Westphalia.\n\u201cClemens had a far better formal education than ninety-eight percent or more of the German or other immigrants. He had completed his \u2019Abitur\u2019 at the Hochschule in Hannover; which meant that he had the equivalent at that time of an American college education and was qualified to attend one of the Universities as a candidate for a Ph.D. degree. He had an acquaintance with Latin and Greek, and spoke French fluently in addition to his native German. He had read widely in History and Philosophy; had acquired a fine vocabulary; and was able to write with clarity. Although raised and instructed in the Roman Catholic Church, he rejected formalized religion and disliked clergymen. He greatly admired Voltaire, and shared many of the latter\u2019s philosophical views. Instead of attending a University, Clemens became a salesman for a textile firm located in Amsterdam, Holland. At the age of twenty-four, in 1848, he decided to emigrate to the United States, where he first traveled about as agent for the textile mill. When he came to Indianapolis in 1850, he encountered a fellow countryman named Vollmer, who had been settled here a few years and was already established in business for himself in a small way as a retail merchant in hardware and sundry merchandise. The two became friends, and Vollmer invited Vonnegut to join him in this enterprise. The firm then became known as Vollmer & Vonnegut. After a short association Vollmer decided to make a journey out West to explore the new country and visit the gold fields recently discovered in California. He was never heard from again, and presumably lost his life in the \u2019Wild West.\u2019\n\u201cVonnegut thus became the sole proprietor of the small business which he in 1852, and later his sons and grandsons, made into a considerable enterprise as the Vonnegut Hardware Company.\n\u201cAcross the street from his first modest shop on East Washington Street in the 1850s was a small German restaurant. One of the waitresses in this establishment was an attractive girl named Katarina Blank. She was one of seven children of a German immigrant family of peasants who came from Urloffen in Baden and settled on a farm in Wayne Township, Marion County, just west of Indianapolis. They were struggling to get their farm to be productive after felling the forest trees and draining the land. With so many children to feed and clothe, all had to work for their living after a few years of primary instruction in the common school. Katarina Blank went to work as a waitress in this little cafe, and soon met Clemens Vonnegut, who fell in love with her. They were married in 1852. He was twenty-eight and she, twenty-four. They bought a modest home on West Market Street and raised their family in steadily improving material circumstances. Katarina was, like Clemens, small in stature and dark complected. Both spoke German in their home, but had considerable fluency in French as well. The training of their children was in the tradition and culture of nineteeth-century Germany. It is highly significant of Clemens\u2019s ascetic and puritanical ethics that his literary idol was Schiller and not Goethe, who was much the greater genius. He disapproved of Goethe\u2019s morals, and would not read him. Katarina, although of humble origin and little formal education, became a highly respected and extremely dignified matriarch, much beloved by her children and grandchildren.\n\u201cClemens attained local distinction as an advocate of progressive public education. He served for twenty-seven years on the Board of School Commissioners of the City of Indianapolis; most of the time as Chairman and Chief administrative Officer. He was an incorruptible and highly efficient officer. He was particularly interested in the High School, and saw to it that first-rate instruction was provided in the classics, history, and the social sciences. He was instrumental in the establishment of the second High School in 1894, known as Manual Training High School, where, under Professor Emmerich as Principal, instruction was provided with emphasis on Science, Mathematics, and Practical Engineering. Graduates of these two high schools Ayere readily accepted at Harvard and Yale and other great Universities until about 1940; since then the prestige of these high schools has sadly declined as a result of lowered standards.\n\u201cMany tales were told of Clemens Vonnegut. When he was elected to the Board of School Commissioners, he found that the local banks did not pay interest on the somewhat large deposits which the Board carried to finance its operations. He demanded that the banks pay interest on the Board\u2019s deposits. This was then considered to be an offensive innovation in the customary and comfortable practice which until then had prevailed. The banker John P. Frenzel then called upon Clemens at his office and loudly upbraided him. Clemens pretended to be hard of hearing, and capped his ears. Frenzel shouted louder. Still Clemens pretended not to hear. Frenzel raised his voice and interjected profanity, but to no avail. Clemens would not \u2019hear\u2019 him. Finally Frenzel stormed out\u2014still not heard. But thenceforth the banks paid interest and have continued to do so to \u00bfhis day.\n\u201cUpon another occasion a disgruntled contractor called upon him and protested the award of a contract for school construction to a bidder who did not have the \u2019right\u2019 political connections. Here again Clemens pretended to be hard of hearing; but, in addition, took out a pen-knife and pared his fingernails. The frustrated contractor then indulged in invectives. Clemens remained calm and silent. After he finished paring his fingernails, he took off his shoes and socks and proceeded to pare his toenails with intense but silent concentration. His visitor soon left in disgust, cursing this crazy German. Clemens remained imperturbable and undisturbed. Many similar tales were told of him, but at his death at age eighty-two in 1906 he was a greatly respected figure in the business and civic life of the community; next only to Henry Schnull as the first in prestige of the German immigrants to Indianapolis.\n\u201cOld Clemens, as he advanced into his seventies, turned over management of his business to the competent hands of his three sons: Clemens, Jr., Franklin, and George. His son Bernard had a brief connection with the Company but disliked what he called \u2019the trade in nails\u2019 and confined his attention to his profession of architecture and to his avocations in the arts. He had never been as robust as his brothers, two of whom lived into their nineties. The old man set them all an example not only of the highest standards of moral integrity but of physical fitness through exercise of the body. To the end of his days old Clemens was a devotee of the teachings of Father Jahn: a sound mind in a sound body. He exercised daily in all weathers and ate and drank very sparingly. He never weighed much over one hundred and ten pounds. He could be seen striding vigorously about the streets swinging a large boulder in each hand. If he passed a tree with a stout branch within reach he would stop, lay down the boulders, and chin himself a number of times on the branch. On a cold December day in the year 1904, in his eighty-third year, he left his home for his usual walk. He apparently became confused and lost his way. When he did not return at his accustomed time, his family instituted a search with the assistance of the police. He was found several miles from his home lying by the side of a road\u2014quite dead. It was the sort of death he would have welcomed\u2014active to the very end.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAlmost all of my ancestors delivered themselves directly from Europe to Indianapolis, except for Peter Lieber and Sophia de St. Andr\u00e9, who had the general store in New Ulm, Minnesota. When Peter returned from the Civil War with a crippled leg, he was full of stories about how Indianapolis was booming.

The hands were as speckled as boxturtles. \"The end of the Rosewater family is now plainly in view.\"\n\"There are other Rosewaters,\" McAllister suggested gently.\nMushari squirmed, for he meant to represent those others soon.\n\"I'm talking about real Rosewaters!\" cried the Senator bitterly. \"The hell with Pisquontuit!\" Pisquontuit, Rhode Island, a seaside resort, was where the only other branch of the family lived.\n\"A buzzard feast, a buzzard feast,\" the Senator moaned, writhing in a masochistic fantasy of how the Rhode Island Rosewaters would pick the Indiana Rosewaters' bones. He coughed hackingly. The cough embarrassed him. He was a chain-smoker, like his son.\nHe went to the mantelpiece, glared at a colored photograph of Eliot there. The picture had been taken at the end of the Second World War. It showed a much-decorated captain of the Infantry. \"So clean, so tall, so purposeful\u2014so clean, so clean!\" He gnashed his crockery teeth. \"What a noble mind is here o'erthrown!\"\nHe scratched himself, though he did not itch. \"How puffy and pasty he looks these days. I've seen healthier complexions on rhubarb pies! Sleeps in his underwear, eats a balanced diet of potato chips, Southern Comfort, and Rosewater Golden Lager Ambrosia Beer.\" He rattled his fingernails against the photograph. \"Him! Him! Captain Eliot Rosewater\u2014Silver Star, Bronze Star, Soldier's Medal, and Purple Heart with Cluster! Sailing champion! Ski champion! Him! Him! My God\u2014the number of times life has said, 'Yes, yes, yes,' to him! Millions of dollars, hundreds of significant friends, the most beautiful, intelligent, talented, affectionate wife imaginable! A splendid education, an elegant mind in a big, clean, body\u2014and what is his reply when life says nothing but, 'Yes, yes, yes'?\n\" 'No, no, no.'\n\"Why?

His skin began to itch, as though he had suddenly become unclean. These were members of the Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps, in their own estimate the \u201cReeks and Wrecks.\u201d Those who couldn\u2019t compete economically with machines had their choice, if they had no source of income, of the Army or the Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps. The soldiers, with their hollowness hidden beneath twinkling buttons and buckles, crisp serge, and glossy leather, didn\u2019t depress Paul nearly as much as the Reeks and Wrecks did.\nHe eased through the work crew, past a black government limousine, and into Homestead.\nA saloon was close to the end of the bridge. Paul had to park his car a half-block away, for another crew was flushing out the storm sewers with an opened fire hydrant. This seemed to be a favorite undertaking. Whenever he had come to Homestead when the temperature had been above freezing, he\u2019d found a hydrant going.\nOne big man, with an air of proprietorship, kept his hands on the wrench that controlled the flow. Another stood by as second-in-command of the water. All around them, and along the course of the water to the sewer mouth, a crowd stood watching. A dirty little boy caught a scrap of paper skittering along the sidewalk, fashioned it into a crude boat, and launched it in the gutter. All eyes followed the craft with interest, seeming to wish it luck as it shot perilous rapids, as it snagged on a twig, spun free, shot into the swift, deep main flow, mounted a crest for a triumphant instant, and plunged into the sewer.\n\u201cUh!\u201d grunted a man standing by Paul, as though he had been aboard the boat.\nPaul worked his way through the crowd, which was continuous with the clientele of the saloon, and got to within one rank of the bar. His back was against an old player piano. No one seemed to have recognized him. It would have been surprising if someone had, for, in line with policy, he kept pretty much to his own side of the river and never permitted his name or picture to appear in the Ilium Star-Tribune.\nAround the bar were old men, pensioners, too old for the Army or the Reeks and Wrecks. Each had before him a headless beer in a glass whose rim was opaqued by hours of slow, thoughtful sipping. These oldsters probably arrived early and left late, and any other business had to be done over their heads. On the screen of the television set behind the bar, a large earth mother of a woman, her voice shut off by the volume knob, beamed, moved her lips excitedly, and broke eggs into a mixing bowl. The old men watched, occasionally clicking their dentures or licking their lips.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Paul self-consciously.\nNo one made a move to let him get to the bar. A fat, whitening collie, curled beneath the barstool of an old man blocking Paul\u2019s way, showed its toothless gums and growled fuzzily.\nFutilely, Paul waved his hand for the bartender\u2019s attention. As he shifted from one foot to the other, he recalled the fully mechanized saloon he, Finnerty, and Shepherd had designed when they\u2019d been playful young engineers. To their surprise, the owner of a restaurant chain had been interested enough to give the idea a try. They\u2019d set up the experimental unit about five doors down from where Paul now stood, with coin machines and endless belts to do the serving, with germicidal lamps cleaning the air, with uniform, healthful light, with continuous soft music from a tape recorder, with seats scientifically designed by an anthropologist to give the average man the absolute maximum in comfort.",

I\u2019ll be seeing you.\u2019\u201d\nFUBAR\nThe word snafu, derived from the initials of situation normal, all fouled up, was welcomed into the American language during World War II, and remains a useful part of the language today. Fubar, a closely related word, was coined at about the same time, and is now all but forgotten. Fubar is worthy of a better fate, meaning as it does fouled up beyond all recognition. It is a particularly useful and interesting word in that it describes a misfortune brought about not by malice but by administrative accidents in some large and complex organization.\nFuzz Littler, for instance, was fubar in the General Forge and Foundry Company. He was familiar with the word fubar\u2014had to hear it only once to know it fit him like a pair of stretch nylon bikini shorts. He was fubar in the Ilium Works of GF&F, which consisted of five hundred and twenty-seven numbered buildings. He became fubar in the classic way, which is to say that he was the victim of a temporary arrangement that became permanent.\nFuzz Littler belonged to the Public Relations Department, and all the public relations people were supposed to be in Building 22. But Building 22 was full up when Fuzz came to work, so they found a temporary desk for Fuzz in an office by the elevator machinery on the top floor of Building 181.\nBuilding 181 had nothing to do with public relations. With the exception of Fuzz\u2019s one-man operation, it was devoted entirely to research into semiconductors. Fuzz shared the office and a typist with a crystallographer named Dr. Lomar Horthy. Fuzz stayed there for eight years, a freak to those he was among, a ghost to those he should have been among. His superiors bore him no malice. They simply kept forgetting about him.\nFuzz did not quit for the simple and honorable reason that he was the sole support of his very sick mother. But the price of being passively fubar was high. Inevitably, Fuzz became listless, cynical, and profoundly introverted.\nAnd then, at the start of Fuzz\u2019s ninth year with the company, when Fuzz himself was twenty-nine, Fate took a hand. Fate sent grease from the Building 181 cafeteria up the elevator shaft. The grease collected on the elevator machinery, caught fire, and Building 181 burned to the ground.\nBut there still wasn\u2019t any room for Fuzz in Building 22, where he belonged, so they fixed him up a temporary office in the basement of Building 523, clear at the end of the company bus line.", 0.06797278911564626], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["father",

to stick together and go on making music at Ann Arbor. Who knows? We might have become so popular that we went on world tours and made great fortunes, and been superstars at peace rallies and love-ins when the Vietnam War came along.\nCADETS AT WEST Point did not make music. The musicians in the dance band and the marching band were Regular Army enlisted men, members of the servant class.\nThey were under orders to play music as written, note for note, and never mind how they felt about the music or about anything.\nFOR THAT MATTER, there wasn\u2019t any student publication at West Point. So never mind how the cadets felt about anything. Not interesting.\nI WAS FINE, but all kinds of things were going wrong with my father\u2019s life. Du Pont was looking him over, as they were looking over everybody at Barrytron, deciding whether to keep him on or not. He was also having a love affair with a married woman whose husband caught him in the act and beat him up.\nThis was a sensitive subject with my parents, naturally, so I never discussed it with them. But the story was all over town, and Father had a black eye. He didn\u2019t play any sports, so he had to make up a story about falling down the basement stairs. Mother weighed about 90 kilograms by then, and berated him all the time about his having sold all his Barrytron stock 2 years too soon. If he had hung on to it until the Du Pont takeover, he would have had $1,000,000, back when it meant something to be a millionaire. If I had been learning-disabled, he could easily have afforded to send me to Tarkington.\nUnlike me, he was the sort of man who had to be in extremis in order to commit adultery. According to a story I heard from enemies at high school, Father had done the jumping-out-the-window thing, hippity-hopping like Peter Cottontail across backyards with his pants around his ankles, and getting bitten by a dog, and getting tangled up in a clothesline, and all the rest of it. That could have been an exaggeration. I never asked.\nI MYSELF WAS deeply troubled by our little family\u2019s image problem, which was complicated when Mother broke her nose 2 days after Father got the black eye. To the outside world it looked as though she had said something to Father about the reason he had a black eye, and his reply had been to slug her. I didn\u2019t think he would ever slug her, no matter what.\nThere is a not quite remote possibility that he really did slug her, of course. Lesser men would have slugged her under similar circumstances. The real truth of the matter became unavailable to historians forever when the falling ceiling of a gift shop on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls killed both participants, as I\u2019ve said, some 20 years ago. They were said to have died instantly. They never knew what hit them, which is the best way to go.\nThere was no argument about that in Vietnam or, I suppose, on any battlefield. One kid I remember stepped on an antipersonnel mine. The mine could have been one of our own.

Again, Groszinger felt the urge to tell about Major Rice and the voices, to see what effect the news would have on someone else. Perhaps his secretary would react as he himself had reacted, with a shrug. Maybe that was the spirit of this era of the atom bomb, H-bomb, God-knows-what-next bomb\u2014to be amazed at nothing. Science had given humanity forces enough to destroy the earth, and politics had given humanity a fair assurance that the forces would be used. There could be no cause for awe to top that one. But proof of a spirit world might at least equal it. Maybe that was the shock the world needed, maybe word from the spirits could change the suicidal course of history.\nGeneral Dane looked up wearily as Groszinger walked into the radio room. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing him down,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else we can do.

It was hand-written, and Trout concluded that the writer might be fourteen years old or so.

He hadn\u2019t been born inside the country. His birthplace was Bermuda. His father, Leo Trout, while remaining an American citizen, worked there for many years for the Royal Ornithological Society\u2014guarding the only nesting place in the world for Bermuda Erns. These great green sea eagles eventually became extinct, despite anything anyone could do.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAs a child, Trout had seen those Erns die, one by one. His father had assigned him the melancholy task of measuring wingspreads of the corpses. These were the largest creatures ever to fly under their own power on the planet. And the last corpse had the greatest wingspread of all, which was nineteen feet, two and three-quarters inches.\nAfter all the Erns were dead, it was discovered what had killed them. It was a fungus, which attacked their eyes and brains. Men had brought the fungus to their rookery in the innocent form of athlete\u2019s foot.\nHere is what the flag of Kilgore Trout\u2019s native island looked like:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo Kilgore Trout had a depressing childhood, despite all of the sunshine and fresh air.

incendiaries. The atom bomb may represent a fabulous advance, but it is interesting to note that primitive TNT and thermite managed to exterminate in one bloody night more people than died in the whole London blitz. Fortress Dresden fired a dozen shots at our airmen. Once back at their bases and sipping hot coffee, they probably remarked, \u201cFlak unusually light tonight. Well, guess it\u2019s time to turn in.\u201d Captured British pilots from tactical fighter units (covering front-line troops) used to chide those who had flown heavy bombers on city raids with, \u201cHow on Earth did you stand the stink of boiling urine and burning perambulators?\u201d\nA perfectly routine piece of news: \u201cLast night our planes attacked Dresden. All planes returned safely.\u201d The only good German is a dead one: over one hundred thousand evil men, women, and children (the able-bodied were at the fronts) forever purged of their sins against humanity. By chance I met a bombardier who had taken part in the attack. \u201cWe hated to do it,\u201d he told me.\nThe night they came over we spent in an underground meat locker in a slaughterhouse. We were lucky, for it was the best shelter in town. Giants stalked the Earth above us. First came the soft murmur of their dancing on the outskirts, then the grumbling of their plodding toward us, and finally the ear-splitting crashes of their heels upon us\u2014and thence to the outskirts again. Back and forth they swept: saturation bombing.\n\u201cI screamed and I wept and I clawed the walls of our shelter,\u201d an old lady told me. \u201cI prayed to God to \u2018please, please, please, dear God, stop them.\u2019 But he didn\u2019t hear me. No power could stop them. On they came, wave after wave. There was no way we could surrender; no way to tell them we couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. There was nothing anyone could do but sit and wait for morning.\u201d Her daughter and grandson were killed.\nOur little prison was burned to the ground. We were to be evacuated to an outlying camp occupied by the South African prisoners. Our guards were a melancholy lot, aged Volkssturmers and disabled veterans. Most of them were Dresden residents and had friends and families somewhere in the holocaust. A corporal, who had lost an eye after two years on the Russian front, ascertained before we marched that his wife, his two children, and both of his parents had been killed. He had one cigarette. He shared it with me.\nOur march to new quarters took us on the city\u2019s edge. It was impossible to believe that anyone survived in its heart. Ordinarily the day would have been cold, but occasional gusts from the colossal inferno made us sweat. And ordinarily the day would have been clear and bright, but an opaque and towering cloud turned noon to twilight. A grim procession clogged the outbound highways; people with blackened faces streaked with tears, some bearing wounded, some bearing dead. They gathered in the fields. None spoke. A few with Red Cross arm-bands did what they could for the casualties.\nSettled with the South Africans, we enjoyed a week without work. At the end of it communications were reestablished with higher headquarters and we were ordered to hike seven miles to the area hardest hit. Nothing in the district had escaped the fury. A city of jagged building shells, of splintered statuary and shattered trees; every vehicle stopped, gnarled and burned, left to rust or rot in the path of the frenzied might. The only sounds other than our own were those of falling plaster and their echoes. I cannot describe the desolation properly, but I can give an idea of how it made us feel, in the words of a delirious British soldier in a makeshift P.W. hospital: \u201cIt\u2019s frightenin\u2019, I tell you. I would walk down one of them bloody streets and feel a thousand eyes on the back of me \u2019ead. I would \u2019ear \u2019em whisperin\u2019 behind me. I would turn around to look at \u2019em and there wouldn\u2019t be a bloomin\u2019 soul in sight. You can feel \u2019em and you can \u2019ear \u2019em but there\u2019s never anybody there.\u201d We knew what he said was so.\nFor \u201csalvage\u201d work we were divided into small crews, each under a guard. Our ghoulish mission was to search for bodies. It was rich hunting that day and the many thereafter. We started on a small scale\u2014here a leg, there an arm, and an occasional baby\u2014but struck a mother lode before noon. We cut our way through a basement wall to discover a reeking hash of over one hundred human beings. Flame must have swept through before the building\u2019s collapse sealed the exits, because the flesh of those within resembled the texture of prunes. Our job, it was explained, was to wade into the shambles and bring forth the remains. Encouraged by cuffing and guttural abuse, wade in we did. We did exactly that, for the floor was covered with an unsavory broth from burst water mains and viscera. A number of victims, not killed outright, had attempted to escape through a narrow emergency exit. At any rate, there were several bodies packed tightly into the passageway. Their leader had made it halfway up the steps before he was buried up to his neck in falling brick and plaster. He was about fifteen, I think.\nIt is with some regret that I here besmirch the nobility of our airmen, but boys, you killed an appalling lot of women and children. The shelter I have described and innumerable others like it were filled with them. We had to exhume their bodies and carry them to mass funeral pyres in the parks\u2014so I know. The funeral pyre technique was abandoned when it became apparent how great was the toll. There was not enough labor to do it nicely, so a man with a flame-thrower was sent down instead, and he cremated them where they lay. Burned alive, suffocated, crushed\u2014men, women, and children indiscriminately killed. For all the sublimity of the cause for which we fought, we surely created a Belsen of our own. The method was impersonal, but the result was equally cruel and heartless. That, I am afraid, is a sickening truth.\nWhen we had become used to the darkness, the odor, and the carnage, we began musing as to what each of the corpses had been in life. It was a sordid game: \u201cRich man, poor man, beggar man, thief\u2026\u201d Some had fat purses and jewelry, others had precious foodstuffs. A boy had his dog still leashed to him. Renegade Ukrainians in German uniform were in charge of our operations in the shelters proper. They were roaring drunk from adjacent wine cellars and seemed to enjoy their job hugely. It was a profitable one, for they stripped each body of valuables before we carried it to the street. Death became so commonplace that we could joke about our dismal burdens and cast them about like so much garbage. Not so with the first of them, especially the young: we had lifted them onto the stretchers with care, laying them out with some semblance of funeral dignity in their last resting place before the pyre. But our awed and sorrowful propriety gave way, as I said, to rank callousness. At the end of a grisly day we would smoke and survey the impressive heap of dead accumulated. One of us flipped his cigarette butt into the pile: \u201cHell\u2019s bells,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m ready for Death anytime he wants to come after me.\u201d", 0.012998507483801602], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
