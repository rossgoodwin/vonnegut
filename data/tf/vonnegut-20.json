He is getting Huge\u201415 lbs, 12 oz. already, and he does the most wonderful things, like laughing out loud. He only eats three times a day, just like us, which astonishes me, but is all he wants, and eats all sorts of things like meat and vegetables, and cereal, and fruit.\u2026 He is an eternal joy, as you three know so well.\u2026 And how is KIT???? Please now, reciprocate in kind by bragging back at us about our wonderful god-child.\u2026 Does he walk yet? How did he take the trip? How did you all take the trip, for that matter? Kiss your beautiful child for us, and give him a happy drool from his cousin Mark. I think Kit would be more interested in Mark now that he makes noises.\u2026 Would that they could grow up together.\u2026\nThe enclosed picture is the only moderately good one we\u2019ve taken yet. Have you ever seen such a tummy?

Never mind cases of extreme discomfort, such as idealists\u2019 being crucified. Two important women in my life, my mother and my only sister, Alice, or Allie, in Heaven now, hated life and said so.

Among those he wouldn\u2019t have resurrected were Jean, and another daughter, Susy, and his beloved wife, and his best friend, Henry Rogers.\nTwain didn\u2019t live to see World War One, but still he felt that way.\nJesus said how awful life was, in the Sermon on the Mount: \u201cBlessed are they that.mourn,\u201d and \u201cBlessed are the meek,\u201d and \u201cBlessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness.\u201d\nHenry David Thoreau said most famously, \u201cThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\u201d\nSo it is not one whit mysterious that we poison the water and air and topsoil, and construct ever more cunning doomsday devices, both industrial and military.

Doris Sawyer, who always directs, said she couldn\u2019t direct this time because her mother was so sick. And she said the club ought to develop some other directors anyway, because she couldn\u2019t live forever, even though she\u2019d made it safely to seventy-four.\nSo I got stuck with the directing job, even though the only thing I\u2019d ever directed before was the installation of combination aluminum storm windows and screens I\u2019d sold. That\u2019s what I am, a salesman of storm windows and doors, and here and there a bathtub enclosure. As far as acting goes, the highest rank I ever held on stage was either butler or policeman, whichever\u2019s higher.\nI made a lot of conditions before I took the directing job, and the biggest one was that Harry Nash, the only real actor the club has, had to take the Marlon Brando part in the play. To give you an idea of how versatile Harry is, inside of one year he was Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny Court Martial, then Abe Lincoln in Abe Lincoln in Illinois and then the young architect in The Moon Is Blue. The year after that, Harry Nash was Henry the Eighth in Anne of the Thousand Days and Doc in Come Back Little Sheba, and I was after him for Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. Harry wasn\u2019t at the meeting to say whether he\u2019d take the part or not. He never came to meetings. He was too shy. He didn\u2019t stay away from meetings because he had something else to do. He wasn\u2019t married, didn\u2019t go out with women\u2014didn\u2019t have any close men friends either. He stayed away from all kinds of gatherings because he never could think of anything to say or do without a script.\nSo I had to go down to Miller\u2019s Hardware Store, where Harry was a clerk, the next day and ask him if he\u2019d take the part. I stopped off at the telephone company to complain about a bill I\u2019d gotten for a call to Honolulu, I\u2019d never called Honolulu in my life.\nAnd there was this beautiful girl I\u2019d never seen before behind the counter at the phone company, and she explained that the company had put in an automatic billing machine and that the machine didn\u2019t have all the bugs out of it yet. It made mistakes. \"Not only did I not call Honolulu,\" I told her, \"I don\u2019t think anybody in North Crawford ever has or will.\"\nSo she took the charge off the bill, and I asked her if she was from around North Crawford. She said no. She said she just came with the new billing machine to teach local girls how to take care of it. After that, she said, she would go with some other machine to someplace else. \"Well,\" I said, \"as long as people have to come along with the machines, I guess we\u2019re all right.\"\n\"What?\" she said.\n\"When machines start delivering themselves,\" I said, \"I guess that\u2019s when the people better start really worrying.\"\n\"Oh,\" she said. She didn\u2019t seem very interested in that subject, and I wondered if she was interested in anything. She seemed kind of numb, almost a machine herself, an automatic phone-company politeness machine.\n\"How long will you be in town here?\" I asked her.", 0.016908554408554405], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["hoess", 0.07017543859649122], ["job", 0.07017543859649122], ["mengel", 0.03508771929824561], ["party", 0.03508771929824561], ["war", 0.03508771929824561], ["suitcase", 0.03508771929824561], ["people", 0.017543859649122806], ["feel", 0.017543859649122806], ["gods", 0.017543859649122806], ["met", 0.017543859649122806], ["measure", 0.017543859649122806], ["year", 0.017543859649122806], ["strap", 0.017543859649122806], ["heard", 0.017543859649122806], ["eve", 0.017543859649122806], ["1944", 0.017543859649122806], ["hanging", 0.017543859649122806], ["wished", 0.017543859649122806], ["packed", 0.017543859649122806], ["warsaw", 0.017543859649122806], ["write", 0.017543859649122806], ["writer", 0.017543859649122806], ["creativity", 0.017543859649122806], ["gift", 0.017543859649122806], ["knew", 0.017543859649122806], ["creative", 0.017543859649122806], ["better", 0.017543859649122806], ["start", 0.017543859649122806], ["shut", 0.017543859649122806], ["full", 0.017543859649122806], ["jobs", 0.017543859649122806], ["worse", 0.017543859649122806], ["auschwitz", 0.017543859649122806], ["big", 0.017543859649122806], ["felt", 0.017543859649122806], ["envy", 0.017543859649122806], ["broken", 0.017543859649122806], ["finished", 0.017543859649122806], ["catch", 0.017543859649122806], ["couldn", 0.017543859649122806], ["hour", 0.017543859649122806], ["buckled", 0.017543859649122806], ["leather", 0.017543859649122806], ["commandant", 0.017543859649122806], ["rudolf", 0.017543859649122806], ["side", 0.017543859649122806], ["clothes", 0.017543859649122806]], "sentiment": ["\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like almost everybody who came through that war.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said.\n\u201cI got so I couldn\u2019t feel anything,\u201d said Mengel. \u201cEvery job was a job to do, and no job was any better or any worse than any other.\n\u201cAfter we finished hanging Hoess,\u201d Mengel said to me, \u201cI packed up my clothes to go home.

stockholder in the family business, the Waltz Brothers Drug Company, to which he had contributed nothing but ridicule and scorn.\nAnd he attended stockholders\u2019 meetings in a beret and a paint-stained smock and sandals, and he brought old August Gunther along, claiming Gunther was his lawyer, and he protested that he found his two uncles and their several sons, who actually ran the business, intolerably humorless and provincial and obsessed by profits, and so on.\nHe would ask them when they were going to stop poisoning their fellow citizens, and so on. At that time, the uncles and cousins were starting the first chain of drugstores in the history of the country, and they were especially proud of the soda fountains in those stores, and had spent a lot of money to guarantee that the ice cream served at those fountains was the equal of any ice cream in the world. So Father wanted to know why ice cream at a Waltz Brothers Drugstore always tasted like library paste, and so on.\nHe was an artist, you see, interested in enterprises far loftier than mere pharmacy.\nAnd now is perhaps the time for me to name my own profession.

Alcohol was involved in the accident. During a wild party at the studio, with tools and building materials lying all around, Father got a structural idea which had to be carried out at once. Nothing would do but that the drunken guests become common laborers under Father\u2019s command, and a young dairy farmer named John Fortune lost his grip on a timber. It fell on Father\u2019s foot, smashing the bones of his instep. Two of his toes died, and had to be cut away.\nThus was Father rendered unfit for military service when America got into World War One.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFather once said to me when he was an old man, after he had spent two years in prison, after he and Mother had lost all their money and art treasures in a lawsuit, that his greatest disappointment in life was that he had never been a soldier. That was almost the last illusion he had, and there might have been some substance to it\u2014that he had been born to serve bravely and resourcefully on a battlefield.", 0.15223214285714287], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "god-bless-you-dr-kevorkian": {"tfidf": [["william", 0.03333333333333333], ["blake", 0.02], ["writer", 0.02], ["frankenstein", 0.02], ["shelley", 0.02], ["mary", 0.02], ["illustrated", 0.013333333333333334], ["scientist", 0.013333333333333334], ["hint", 0.013333333333333334], ["parents", 0.013333333333333334], ["famous", 0.013333333333333334], ["heaven", 0.013333333333333334], ["men", 0.013333333333333334], ["number", 0.013333333333333334], ["wollstonecraft", 0.013333333333333334], ["ignorant", 0.013333333333333334], ["women", 0.013333333333333334], ["friends", 0.013333333333333334], ["person", 0.013333333333333334], ["opinions", 0.006666666666666667], ["thomas", 0.006666666666666667], ["entanglements", 0.006666666666666667], ["course", 0.006666666666666667], ["atomic", 0.006666666666666667], ["tyrant", 0.006666666666666667], ["children", 0.006666666666666667], ["suicide", 0.006666666666666667], ["father", 0.006666666666666667], ["inventions", 0.006666666666666667], ["lord", 0.006666666666666667], ["frankensteinian", 0.006666666666666667], ["texas", 0.006666666666666667], ["returned", 0.006666666666666667], ["keats", 0.006666666666666667], ["tanks", 0.006666666666666667], ["rhapsodize", 0.006666666666666667], ["calvinist", 0.006666666666666667], ["mystery", 0.006666666666666667], ["percy", 0.006666666666666667], ["celebrity", 0.006666666666666667], ["married", 0.006666666666666667], ["bombs", 0.006666666666666667], ["promise", 0.006666666666666667], ["passionate", 0.006666666666666667], ["disorder", 0.006666666666666667], ["bysshe", 0.006666666666666667], ["wrote", 0.006666666666666667], ["signing", 0.006666666666666667], ["distinguished", 0.006666666666666667], ["byron", 0.006666666666666667], ["dead", 0.006666666666666667], ["preacher", 0.006666666666666667], ["books", 0.006666666666666667], ["subject", 0.006666666666666667], ["wire", 0.006666666666666667], ["god", 0.006666666666666667], ["mines", 0.006666666666666667], ["monsters", 0.006666666666666667], ["full", 0.006666666666666667], ["memorably", 0.006666666666666667], ["equals", 0.006666666666666667], ["imagine", 0.006666666666666667], ["throwers", 0.006666666666666667], ["thirty", 0.006666666666666667], ["created", 0.006666666666666667], ["influential", 0.006666666666666667], ["inspired", 0.006666666666666667], ["times", 0.006666666666666667], ["husband", 0.006666666666666667], ["hiroshima", 0.006666666666666667], ["named", 0.006666666666666667], ["anti", 0.006666666666666667], ["drowned", 0.006666666666666667], ["romantically", 0.006666666666666667], ["nowadays", 0.006666666666666667], ["paine", 0.006666666666666667], ["story", 0.006666666666666667], ["spoke", 0.006666666666666667], ["twenty", 0.006666666666666667], ["people", 0.006666666666666667], ["three", 0.006666666666666667], ["fiction", 0.006666666666666667], ["prescient", 0.006666666666666667], ["breeding", 0.006666666666666667], ["john", 0.006666666666666667], ["today", 0.006666666666666667], ["life", 0.006666666666666667], ["huntsville", 0.006666666666666667], ["gas", 0.006666666666666667], ["hoped", 0.006666666666666667], ["prometheus", 0.006666666666666667], ["nagasaki", 0.006666666666666667], ["novel", 0.006666666666666667], ["romantic", 0.006666666666666667], ["science", 0.006666666666666667], ["war", 0.006666666666666667], ["will", 0.006666666666666667], ["precocious", 0.006666666666666667], ["flame", 0.006666666666666667], ["treated", 0.006666666666666667], ["example", 0.006666666666666667], ["godwin", 0.006666666666666667], ["century", 0.006666666666666667], ["modern", 0.006666666666666667], ["unarmed", 0.006666666666666667], ["dropped", 0.006666666666666667], ["author", 0.006666666666666667], ["wordsworth", 0.006666666666666667], ["1818", 0.006666666666666667], ["poetry", 0.006666666666666667], ["book", 0.006666666666666667], ["vonnegut", 0.006666666666666667], ["incredibly", 0.006666666666666667], ["barbed", 0.006666666666666667], ["airplanes", 0.006666666666666667], ["time", 0.006666666666666667], ["posion", 0.006666666666666667], ["land", 0.006666666666666667], ["wife", 0.006666666666666667], ["monster", 0.006666666666666667], ["thought", 0.006666666666666667], ["mother", 0.006666666666666667], ["kurt", 0.006666666666666667]], "sentiment": ["Hint number two: Breeding will tell.

William Blake and Thomas Paine, and William Wordsworth to name a few.\nHint number three: This person was married to a celebrity, as famous for the romantic disorder of his life as for his poetry. He inspired the suicide of his first wife, for example. As Romantically as you please, he drowned when he was only thirty.\nGive up? I spoke in Heaven today to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, author, again before she was twenty, of the most prescient and influential science fiction novel of all times: Frankenstein: Or the Modern Prometheus. That was in 1818, a full century before the end of the First World War\u2014with its Frankensteinian inventions of posion gas, tanks and airplanes, flame throwers and land mines, and barbed-wire entanglements everywhere.\nI hoped to get Mary Shelley\u2019s opinions of the atomic bombs we dropped on the unarmed men, women, and children of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\u2014and promise to try again. This time, though, she would only rhapsodize about her parents, who were, of course, William and Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, and about her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and his friends and hers, John Keats and Lord Byron.\nI said many ignorant people nowadays thought \u201cFrankenstein\u201d was the name of the monster, and not of the scientist who created him.\nShe said, \u201cThat\u2019s not so ignorant after all.

There was no need for whispering, Haley thought, with the walls three yards thick.\n\u201cCertainly we want to know another secret,\u201d said Hope. \u201cLet\u2019s have it.\u201d\nMr. Banghart reached inside his faded shirt, bringing forth a long leather sheath. He drew from the sheath a double-edged hunting knife, with a blade the length of his hand. He twisted it before his eyes slowly\u2014affectionately, Haley thought\u2014and its bright surfaces sent flecks of light racing along the walls. \u201cIt\u2019s so sharp I can shave with it,\u201d he said, running a moistened finger over the edge. \u201cHoned it for two hours last night.\u201d He smiled proudly. \u201cNow I\u2019m ready for anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really use it on somebody,\u201d said Haley, making an effort to appear as undisturbed by the knife as Hope seemed to be. Though he managed to keep his voice casual, he was wishing that he had not settled in the corner farthest from the tunnel, with Mr. Banghart between him and the outside world.\n\u201cOh, wouldn\u2019t I use it, though?\u201d said Mr. Banghart. He jabbed the blade into a bale. \u201cWouldn\u2019t I, though? Let me tell you something, Haley: If they want to play rough, so can I.\u201d\nHaley looked questioningly at Hope and caught her laughing quietly at his discomfort. He remembered that when he had quizzed her about Mr. Banghart\u2019s hallucinations of a world out to get him, she had shrugged them off as being amusing and nothing more. \u201cI think we\u2019d better go to supper,\u201d Haley murmured.\nHope agreed and started for the tunnel. Mr. Banghart did not budge but continued to stare at the blade. Hope nudged him gently to break his fascination. The flashlight slipped from his hand to bang on the floor and go out.\nThe shock of sudden darkness released Haley\u2019s dammed-up fear. He plunged toward the tunnel, driving with every bit of strength in his legs. His shoulder struck something soft, and he heard Hope cry out in anger. He wriggled into the passageway and made his way to the corridor in a few seconds, emerging breathless and badly scratched by the splintery floor. He was almost to the loft ladder before realization of what he had done broke his frantic stride. Worse than leaving Hope to defend herself, he had knocked her aside in order to save his own skin.\nFear and conscience struggled for mastery of his feet. Conscience gained an almost imperceptible advantage, and Haley found himself returning slowly to the tunnel. In his hand was a claw hammer he had found by the ladder.", 0.09192708333333333], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["general", 0.043209876543209874], ["roy", 0.037037037037037035], ["kitty", 0.024691358024691357], ["motorcycle", 0.024691358024691357], ["haley", 0.024691358024691357], ["kerwham", 0.018518518518518517], ["german", 0.012345679012345678], ["married", 0.012345679012345678], ["doorway", 0.012345679012345678], ["dollars", 0.012345679012345678], ["sir", 0.012345679012345678], ["time", 0.012345679012345678], ["managed", 0.006172839506172839], ["stamped", 0.006172839506172839], ["recollection", 0.006172839506172839], ["snickered", 0.006172839506172839], ["hell", 0.006172839506172839], ["chair", 0.006172839506172839], ["shrugged", 0.006172839506172839], ["blow", 0.006172839506172839], ["father", 0.006172839506172839], ["young", 0.006172839506172839], ["better", 0.006172839506172839], ["idiots", 0.006172839506172839], ["going", 0.006172839506172839], ["smile", 0.006172839506172839], ["save", 0.006172839506172839], ["bereft", 0.006172839506172839], ["hope", 0.006172839506172839], ["thirty", 0.006172839506172839], ["crash", 0.006172839506172839], ["choice", 0.006172839506172839], ["tails", 0.006172839506172839], ["foot", 0.006172839506172839], ["imitating", 0.006172839506172839], ["lady", 0.006172839506172839], ["fled", 0.006172839506172839], ["room", 0.006172839506172839], ["pillbox", 0.006172839506172839], ["appreciatively", 0.006172839506172839], ["distracting", 0.006172839506172839], ["howitzer", 0.006172839506172839], ["marry", 0.006172839506172839], ["chuckled", 0.006172839506172839], ["audience", 0.006172839506172839], ["race", 0.006172839506172839], ["steeple", 0.006172839506172839], ["aachen", 0.006172839506172839], ["lifted", 0.006172839506172839], ["wasn", 0.006172839506172839], ["second", 0.006172839506172839], ["crisply", 0.006172839506172839], ["dear", 0.006172839506172839], ["battalion", 0.006172839506172839], ["stood", 0.006172839506172839], ["jumped", 0.006172839506172839], ["fox", 0.006172839506172839], ["staccato", 0.006172839506172839], ["wham", 0.006172839506172839], ["love", 0.006172839506172839], ["seconds", 0.006172839506172839], ["monotone", 0.006172839506172839], ["lose", 0.006172839506172839], ["concentrate", 0.006172839506172839], ["240", 0.006172839506172839], ["post", 0.006172839506172839], ["super", 0.006172839506172839], ["ker", 0.006172839506172839], ["shot", 0.006172839506172839], ["kitchen", 0.006172839506172839], ["sister", 0.006172839506172839], ["daughter", 0.006172839506172839], ["couldn", 0.006172839506172839], ["extension", 0.006172839506172839], ["brilliant", 0.006172839506172839], ["ill", 0.006172839506172839], ["rattattattatat", 0.006172839506172839], ["times", 0.006172839506172839], ["annie", 0.006172839506172839], ["erector", 0.006172839506172839], ["loud", 0.006172839506172839], ["glittering", 0.006172839506172839], ["tone", 0.006172839506172839], ["suddenly", 0.006172839506172839], ["declared", 0.006172839506172839], ["feelings", 0.006172839506172839], ["embarrassed", 0.006172839506172839], ["set", 0.006172839506172839], ["church", 0.006172839506172839], ["chromium", 0.006172839506172839], ["devil", 0.006172839506172839], ["shells", 0.006172839506172839], ["twenty", 0.006172839506172839], ["twisted", 0.006172839506172839], ["rankled", 0.006172839506172839], ["care", 0.006172839506172839], ["limousine", 0.006172839506172839], ["trappings", 0.006172839506172839], ["interests", 0.006172839506172839], ["affectionate", 0.006172839506172839], ["fire", 0.006172839506172839], ["doomed", 0.006172839506172839], ["jerries", 0.006172839506172839], ["squeeze", 0.006172839506172839], ["kind", 0.006172839506172839], ["kindly", 0.006172839506172839], ["hour", 0.006172839506172839], ["car", 0.006172839506172839], ["replaced", 0.006172839506172839], ["faded", 0.006172839506172839], ["voice", 0.006172839506172839], ["motors", 0.006172839506172839], ["plated", 0.006172839506172839], ["throat", 0.006172839506172839], ["vanish", 0.006172839506172839], ["scat", 0.006172839506172839], ["began", 0.006172839506172839], ["jerry", 0.006172839506172839], ["started", 0.006172839506172839], ["role", 0.006172839506172839], ["build", 0.006172839506172839], ["exhaust", 0.006172839506172839], ["forced", 0.006172839506172839], ["mother", 0.006172839506172839], ["hand", 0.006172839506172839], ["flemming", 0.006172839506172839], ["man", 0.006172839506172839], ["afresh", 0.006172839506172839], ["observation", 0.006172839506172839], ["clear", 0.006172839506172839], ["dragged", 0.006172839506172839], ["pipe", 0.006172839506172839], ["hello", 0.006172839506172839], ["left", 0.006172839506172839]], "sentiment": ["Roy had started to back out of the room, embarrassed, and bereft of all save the glittering trappings of his devil-may-care role.

Annie snickered appreciatively, and Haley forced a smile.\n\u201cAnd then there was the time at Aachen, when the Jerries were using a church steeple for an observation post,\u201d the General began afresh. His back was to the doorway, and he twisted around in his chair to see what it was behind him that was distracting his audience. Kitty stood in the doorway. \u201cHello, dear,\u201d he said to her, in a kindly tone. \u201cI hope you\u2019ve gotten over any ill feelings you may have had against your old father.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to marry him, and that\u2019s that.\u201d\nThe General shrugged. He took her hand and gave it an affectionate squeeze. \u201cWhat do you want to do \u2014 mother a race of super-idiots? He can\u2019t concentrate on anything but his motorcycle for more than twenty seconds at a time. If you two were married and down to your last five dollars, he\u2019d blow it on two fox tails and a chromium-plated exhaust-pipe extension. If it came to a choice between you or the motorcycle, sister, you\u2019d lose.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d declared Kitty. \u201cHe knows more about motors than anybody. And, while we\u2019re getting mean about it, what about you? You\u2019re as much in love with that German limousine of yours as Roy is with his motorcycle.\u201d\nHaley saw that this rankled the General a little. \u201cThat car,\u201d he said crisply, \u201cis the only one of its kind in the world. It couldn\u2019t be replaced for thirty thousand dollars. Moreover, young lady, I do have other interests. Take away Roy\u2019s motorcycle, and he\u2019d vanish.

thinking machine could be so petty, too. It would not let her go downstairs in her combat fatigues on the grounds that everybody, even though there was practically nobody in the hotel, would find her comical in such a costume. Her brain told her: \u201cThey\u2019ll laugh at you behind your back, and think you\u2019re crazy and pitiful, and your life is over anyway. You\u2019ve lost your husband and your teaching job, and you don\u2019t have any children or anything else to live for, so just put yourself out of your misery with the garment bag. What could be easier? What could be more painless? What could make more sense?\nTo give her brain its due: It wasn\u2019t entirely its fault that 1986 really had been a perfectly awful year so far. The year had started out so promisingly, too, with Mary\u2019s husband, Roy, in seemingly perfect health and secure in his job as a millwright at GEFFCo, the principal industry in Ilium, and with the Kiwanis giving her a banquet and a plaque celebrating her twenty-five years of distinguished teaching, and the students naming her the most popular teacher for the twelfth year in a row.\nAt the start of 1986, she said, \u201cOh, Roy\u2014we have so much to be thankful for: we\u2019re so lucky compared to most people. I could cry for happiness.\u201d\nAnd he said, putting his arms around her, \u201cWell now, you just go ahead and cry.\u201d She was fifty-one and he was fifty-nine, and they were great lovers of the out-of-doors, hiking and skiing and mountain-climbing and canoeing and running and bicycling and swimming, so they both had lean and youthful bodies. They did not smoke or drink, and they ate mostly fresh fruits and vegetables, with a little fish from time to time.\nThey had also handled their money well, giving their savings, in financial terms, the same sort of sensible nourishment and exercise that they gave themselves.\nThe tale of fiscal wisdom which Mary could tell about herself and Roy, of course, would be a thrill to James Wait.\nAnd, yes, Wait, that eviscerator of widows, was speculating about Mary Hepburn as he sat in the bar of the El Dorado, although he had not met her yet, nor learned for certain how well fixed she was. He had seen her name on the hotel register, and had asked the young manager about her.\nWait liked what little the manager was able to tell him. This shy and lonesome schoolteacher upstairs, although younger than any of the wives he had ruined so far, sounded to him like his natural prey. He would stalk her at leisure during \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d\nIf I may insert a personal note at this point: When I was alive, I often received advice from my own big brain which, in terms of my own survival, or the survival of the human race, for that matter, can be charitably described as questionable. Example: It had me join the United States Marines and go fight in Vietnam.\nThanks a lot, big brain.", 0.16008297258297252], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["sky", 0.06451612903225806], ["eyebrows", 0.03225806451612903], ["picture", 0.03225806451612903], ["sailor", 0.03225806451612903], ["duck", 0.03225806451612903], ["girl", 0.03225806451612903], ["fine", 0.03225806451612903], ["ground", 0.03225806451612903], ["blue", 0.03225806451612903], ["grinder", 0.03225806451612903], ["monkey", 0.03225806451612903], ["bottom", 0.03225806451612903], ["top", 0.03225806451612903], ["arching", 0.03225806451612903], ["supplied", 0.03225806451612903], ["bench", 0.03225806451612903], ["slazinger", 0.03225806451612903], ["wouldn", 0.03225806451612903], ["winking", 0.03225806451612903], ["dirt", 0.03225806451612903], ["park", 0.03225806451612903], ["suggested", 0.03225806451612903], ["easily", 0.03225806451612903], ["clouds", 0.03225806451612903], ["organ", 0.03225806451612903], ["brown", 0.03225806451612903], ["beach", 0.03225806451612903], ["green", 0.03225806451612903], ["grass", 0.03225806451612903], ["talk", 0.03225806451612903]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t?\u201d she said. \u201cBut I tell you what I\u2019d really like to see there since our talk on the beach.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is\u2014?\u201d I said, arching my eyebrows and then winking at Slazinger again.\n\u201cI\u2019d like a picture with some grass and dirt at the bottom,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBrown and green,\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd sky at the top.\u201d\n\u201cBlue,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMaybe with clouds,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEasily supplied,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd in between the sky and the ground\u2014\u201d she said.\n\u201cA duck?\u201d I said. \u201cAn organ-grinder with his monkey?

When he was forty-one, he says, Jesus appeared to him and made him knock off the sauce, stop gargling nose paint.\nOther drunks have seen pink elephants.\nAbout my own history of foreign substance abuse, I\u2019ve been a coward about heroin and cocaine, LSD and so on, afraid they might put me over the edge. I did smoke a joint of marijuana one time with Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead, just to be sociable. It didn\u2019t seem to do anything to me one way or the other, so I never did it again. And by the grace of God, or whatever, I am not an alcoholic, largely a matter of genes. I take a couple of drinks now and then and will do it again tonight. But two is my limit. No problem.\nI am, of course, notoriously hooked on cigarettes. I keep hoping the things will kill me. A fire at one end and a fool at the other.\nBut I\u2019ll tell you one thing: I once had a high that not even crack cocaine could match. That was when I got my first driver\u2019s license\u2014look out, world, here comes Kurt Vonnegut!\nAnd my car back then, a Studebaker as I recall, was powered, as are almost all means of transportation and other machinery today, and electric power plants and furnaces, by the most abused, addictive, and destructive drugs of all: fossil fuels.\nWhen you got here, even when I got here, the industrialized world was already hopelessly hooked on fossil fuels, and very soon now there won\u2019t be any left. Cold turkey.\nCan I tell you the truth? I mean this isn\u2019t the TV news is it? Here\u2019s what I think the truth is: We are all addicts of fossil fuels in a state of denial. And like so many addicts about to face cold turkey, our leaders are now committing violent crimes to get what little is left of what we\u2019re hooked on.\nWhat was the beginning of this end? Some might say Adam and Eve and the apple of knowledge, a clear case of entrapment. I say it was Prometheus, a Titan, a son of gods, who in Greek myth stole fire from Zeus and gave it to human beings. The gods were so mad they chained him naked to a rock with his back exposed, and had eagles eat his liver. \u201cSpare the rod and spoil the child.\u201d\nAnd it is now plain that the gods were right to do that. Our close cousins the gorillas and orangs and chimps and gibbon apes have gotten along just fine all this time while eating raw vegetable matter, whereas we not only prepare hot meals but have now all but destroyed this once salubrious planet as a life-support system in fewer than two hundred years, mainly by making thermodynamic whoopee with fossil fuels.", -0.02037829234257805], "title": "A Man

your letter as \u201cAmerican authors.\u201d We do not feel especially American in this instance, since we spoke only for ourselves\u2014without consulting with any American institution whatsoever. We are simply \u201cauthors\u201d in this case, expressing loyalty to the great and vulnerable family of writers throughout the world. You and all other members of the Union of Writers surely have the same family feelings. Those of us who sent the cable are so far from being organized that I have no idea what sorts of replies the others may be making to you.\nAs you must know, your response to our cable was printed recently in The New York Times, and perhaps elsewhere. The controversy has attracted little attention. It is a matter of interest, seemingly, only to other writers. Nobody cares much about writers but writers. And, if it weren\u2019t for a few of us like the signers of the cable, I wonder if there would be anybody to care about writers\u2014no matter how much trouble they were in. Should we, too, stop caring?\nWell\u2014I understand that our cultures are so different that we can never agree about freedom of expression. It is natural that we should disagree, and perhaps even commendable. What you may not know about our own culture is that writers such as those who signed the cable are routinely attacked by fellow citizens as being pornographers or corrupted of children and celebrators of violence and persons of no talent and so on. In my own case, such charges are brought against my works in court several times a year, usually by parents who, for religious or political reasons, do not want their children to read what I have to say. The parents, incidentally, often find their charges supported by the lowest courts. The charges so far have been invariably overthrown in higher courts, those closer to the soul of the Constitution of the United States.\nPlease convey the contents of this letter to my brothers and sisters in the Writers\u2019 Union, as we conveyed your letter to The New York Times. This letter is specifically for you, to do with as you please. I am not sending carbon copies to anyone. It has not even been read by my wife.\nThat homely detail, if brought to the attention of the Writers\u2019 Union, might help its members to understand what I do not think is at all well understood now: That we are not nationalists, taking part in some cold-war enterprise. We simply care deeply about how things are going for writers here, there, and everywhere. Even when they are declared non-writers, as we have been, we continue to care.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nKuznetzov gave me a prompt and likewise private answer. It was gracious and humane. I could assume that we were still friends. He said nothing against his union of his government. Neither did he say anything to discourage me from feeling that writers everywhere, good and bad, were all first cousins\u2014first cousins, at least.\nAnd all the argle-bargling that goes on between educated persons in the United States and the Soviet Union is so touching and comical, really, as long as it does not lead to war. It draws its energy, in my opinion, from a desperate wish on both sides that each other\u2019s utopias should work much better than they do. We want to tinker with theirs, to make it work much better than it does\u2014so that people there, for example, can say whatever they please without fear of punishment. They want to tinker with ours, so that everybody here who wants a job can have one, and so that we don\u2019t have to tolerate the sales of fist-fucking films and snuff films and so on.\nNeither utopia now works much better than the Page typesetting machine, in which Mark Twain invested and lost a fortune. That beautiful contraption actually set type just once, when only Twain and the inventor were watching. Twain called all the other investors to see this miracle, but, by the time they got there, the inventor had taken the machine all apart again. It never ran again.\nPeace.", 0.09320454545454546], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["hoenikker", 0.04395604395604396], ["waste", 0.03296703296703297], ["cot", 0.03296703296703297], ["jenny", 0.02197802197802198], ["house", 0.02197802197802198], ["yessir", 0.02197802197802198], ["rack", 0.02197802197802198], ["heavy", 0.01098901098901099], ["wound", 0.01098901098901099], ["married", 0.01098901098901099], ["saskatchewan", 0.01098901098901099], ["rest", 0.01098901098901099], ["walk", 0.01098901098901099], ["helped", 0.01098901098901099], ["bright", 0.01098901098901099], ["noise", 0.01098901098901099], ["minds", 0.01098901098901099], ["sea", 0.01098901098901099], ["talks", 0.01098901098901099], ["close", 0.01098901098901099], ["shrugged", 0.01098901098901099], ["george", 0.01098901098901099], ["sat", 0.01098901098901099], ["lie", 0.01098901098901099], ["shambled", 0.01098901098901099], ["van", 0.01098901098901099], ["bottom", 0.01098901098901099], ["things", 0.01098901098901099], ["lean", 0.01098901098901099], ["fingers", 0.01098901098901099], ["flamingo", 0.01098901098901099], ["diver", 0.01098901098901099], ["better", 0.01098901098901099], ["live", 0.01098901098901099], ["machine", 0.01098901098901099], ["jaw", 0.01098901098901099], ["closed", 0.01098901098901099], ["snap", 0.01098901098901099], ["living", 0.01098901098901099], ["nurse", 0.01098901098901099], ["man", 0.01098901098901099], ["moose", 0.01098901098901099], ["lit", 0.01098901098901099], ["door", 0.01098901098901099], ["pretty", 0.01098901098901099], ["sir", 0.01098901098901099], ["fellow", 0.01098901098901099], ["brains", 0.01098901098901099], ["human", 0.01098901098901099], ["time", 0.01098901098901099], ["weak", 0.01098901098901099], ["guess", 0.01098901098901099], ["hurt", 0.01098901098901099], ["appliances", 0.01098901098901099], ["cigarette", 0.01098901098901099], ["carried", 0.01098901098901099], ["moving", 0.01098901098901099], ["lay", 0.01098901098901099], ["coming", 0.01098901098901099], ["snapped", 0.01098901098901099], ["strong", 0.01098901098901099], ["lady", 0.01098901098901099], ["couldn", 0.01098901098901099], ["steel", 0.01098901098901099], ["great", 0.01098901098901099], ["technical", 0.01098901098901099], ["god", 0.01098901098901099], ["shock", 0.01098901098901099], ["florida", 0.01098901098901099], ["walked", 0.01098901098901099], ["face", 0.01098901098901099], ["looked", 0.01098901098901099], ["good", 0.01098901098901099], ["nancy", 0.01098901098901099], ["night", 0.01098901098901099], ["tall", 0.01098901098901099], ["selling", 0.01098901098901099], ["shaking", 0.01098901098901099], ["asked", 0.01098901098901099], ["shook", 0.01098901098901099]], "sentiment": ["\u201cShe has things to say to you,\u201d Mr. Hoenikker said. \u201cShe\u2019s been asking for you all night.

the night-crawler merchants had been stockholders and bondholders in the Rosewater Inter-State Ship Canal. When the scheme failed utterly, some of them lost their farms, which were bought by Noah Rosewater. A Utopian community in the southwest corner of the county, New Ambrosia, invested everything it had in the canal, and lost. They were Germans, communists and atheists who practiced group marriage, absolute truthfuless, absolute cleanliness, and absolute love. They were now scattered to the winds, like the worthless papers that represented their equity in the canal. No one was sorry to see them go. Their one contribution to the county that was still viable in Eliot's time was their brewery, which had become the home of Rosewater Golden Lager Ambrosia Beer. On the label of each can of beer was a picture of the heaven on earth the New Ambrosians had meant to build. The dream city had spires. The spires had lightning-rods. The sky was filled with cherubim.\nThe town of Rosewater was in the dead center of the county. In the dead center of town was a Parthenon built of honest red brick, columns and all. Its roof was green copper. The canal ran through it, and so, in the bustling past, had the New York Central, Monon, and Nickel Plate Railroads. When Eliot and Sylvia took up residence, only the canal and the Monon tracks remained, and the Monon was bankrupt, and its tracks were brown.\nTo the west of the Parthenon was the old Rosewater Saw Company, red brick, too, green-roofed, too. The spine of its roof was broken, its windows unglazed. It was a New Ambrosia for barn swallows and bats. Its four tower clocks were handless. Its big brass whistle was choked with nests.\nTo the east of the Parthenon was the County Courthouse, red brick, too, green-roofed, too. Its tower was identical with that of the old saw company. Three of its four clocks still had their hands, but they did not run. Like an abscess at the base of a dead tooth, a private business had somehow managed to establish itself in the cellar of the public building. It had a little red neon sign. \"Bella's Beauty Nook,\" it said. Bella weighed three hundred fourteen pounds.\nTo the east of the courthouse was the Samuel Rosewater Veterans' Memorial Park. It had a flagpole and an honor roll. The honor roll was a four-by-eight sheet of exterior plywood painted black. It was hung on pipe, sheltered by a gable that was only two inches wide. It had all the names of Rosewater County people who had laid down their lives for their country.\nThe only other masonry structures were the Rosewater Mansion and its carriage house, set on an artificial elevation at the east end of the park and surrounded by a rank of iron spikes, and the Noah Rosewater Memorial High School, home of the Fighting Sawmakers, which bounded the park on the south. To the north of the park was the old Rosewater Opera House, a terrifyingly combustible frame wedding cake which had been converted to a firehouse. All else was shithouses, shacks, alcoholism, ignorance, idiocy and perversion, for all that was healthy and busy and intelligent in Rosewater County shunned the county seat.\nThe new Rosewater Saw Company, all yellow brick and no windows, was set in a cornfield midway between Rosewater and New Ambrosia. It was served by a gleaming new spur of the New York Central, and by a sizzling double-barreled highway that missed the county seat by eleven miles. Near it were the Rosewater Motel and the Rosewater Bowl-A-Rama, and the great grain elevators and animal pens that were shipping points for fruits of the Rosewater Farms. And the few highly paid agronomists, engineers, brewers, accountants and administrators who did all that needed doing lived in a defensive circle of expensive ranch homes in another cornfield near New Ambrosia, a community named, for no reason whatsoever, \"Avondale.\" All had gas-lit patios framed and terraced with railroad ties from the old Nickel Plate right-of-way.\nEliot stood in relation to the clean people of Avondale as a constitutional monarch. They were employees of the Rosewater Corporation, and the properties they managed were owned by the Rosewater Foundation. Eliot could not tell them what to do\u2014but he was surely the King, and Avondale knew it.\nSo, when King Eliot and Queen Sylvia took up residence in the Rosewater Mansion, they were showered by figs from Avondale\u2014invitations, visits, flattering notes and calls. All were deflected. Eliot required Sylvia to receive all prosperous visitors with an air of shallow, absent-minded cordiality. Every Avondale woman left the mansion stiffly, as though, as Eliot observed gleefully, she had a pickle up her ass.\nInterestingly, the social-climbing technocrats of Avondale were able to bear the theory that the Rosewaters snubbed them because the Rosewaters felt superior to them. They even enjoyed the theory as they discussed it again and again. They were avid for lessons in authentic, upper-class snobbery, and Eliot and Sylvia seemed to be giving those.", 0.027683092520754852], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf":

out loud, and all would hear it, and all would go home. Peace should not be broken for any cause.\nAlexander meant to say in his prayer that afternoon that God should protect the working people from leaders like Colin Jarvis, who had encouraged them to bring such misery and heartbreak on themselves.\n\u201cAmen,\u201d he said to himself.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd the people came as promised. They came on foot. In order to discourage them, the city fathers had canceled all streetcar service in that part of the city that day.\nThere were many children among them, and even infants in arms. One infant would be shot to death and inspire the poem by Henry Niles Whistler, later put to music and still sung today, \u201cBonnie Failey.\u201d\nWhere were the soldiers? They had been standing in front of the factory fence since eight o\u2019clock, with bayonets already fixed, with full packs on their backs. Those packs weighed fifty pounds and more. They were Colonel Redfield\u2019s idea of how to make his men more fearsome. They were in a single rank, which stretched the width of the plaza. The battle plan was this: If the crowd would not disperse when told to, the soldiers were to level their bayonets and to clear the plaza slowly but irresistibly, glacially\u2014maintaining a perfectly straight rank that bristled with cold steel, and advancing, always on command, one step, then two, then three, then four \u2026\nOnly the soldiers had been outside the fence since eight. The snow had kept on falling. So when the first members of the crowd appeared at the far end of the plaza, they gazed at the factory over an expanse of virgin snow. The only footprints were those they themselves had just made.\nAnd many more people came than had spiritual business to conduct specifically with Cuyahoga Bridge and Iron. The strikers themselves were mystified as to who all these other ragged strangers might be\u2014who also, often, had brought their families along. These outsiders, too, wished to demonstrate to simply anybody their misery and heartbreak at Christmastide. Young Alexander, peering through his binoculars, read a sign a man was carrying that said, \u201cErie Coal and Iron unfair to workers.\u201d Erie Coal and Iron wasn\u2019t even an Ohio firm. It was in Buffalo, New York.\nSo it was against considerable odds that Bonnie Failey, the infant killed in the Massacre, was actually the child of a striker against Cuyahoga Bridge and Iron, that Henry Niles Whistler was able to say in the refrain of his poem about her:", 0.020292207792207785], "title": "Jailbird"}, "petrified-ants": {"tfidf": [["0", 0.5], ["v3", 0.5]], "sentiment": ["v3.0", 0.0], "title": "Petrified Ants"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["god", 0.058823529411764705], ["book", 0.04411764705882353], ["understand", 0.04411764705882353], ["people", 0.029411764705882353], ["bokononist", 0.029411764705882353], ["bokonon", 0.029411764705882353], ["intend", 0.029411764705882353], ["lies", 0.029411764705882353], ["worm", 0.029411764705882353], ["warning", 0.029411764705882353], ["sees", 0.014705882352941176], ["fired", 0.014705882352941176], ["sentence", 0.014705882352941176], ["karass", 0.014705882352941176], ["mine", 0.014705882352941176], ["tendrils", 0.014705882352941176], ["screamed", 0.014705882352941176], ["collectively", 0.014705882352941176], ["examine", 0.014705882352941176], ["writes", 0.014705882352941176], ["books", 0.014705882352941176], ["motorboats", 0.014705882352941176], ["pass", 0.014705882352941176], ["earth", 0.014705882352941176], ["thinks", 0.014705882352941176], ["forget", 0.014705882352941176], ["unable", 0.014705882352941176], ["tentative", 0.014705882352941176], ["explain", 0.014705882352941176], ["better", 0.014705882352941176], ["religion", 0.014705882352941176], ["behalf", 0.014705882352941176], ["include", 0.014705882352941176], ["fool", 0.014705882352941176], ["doghouse", 0.014705882352941176], ["offer", 0.014705882352941176], ["bear", 0.014705882352941176], ["tangling", 0.014705882352941176], ["minister", 0.014705882352941176], ["members", 0.014705882352941176], ["tract", 0.014705882352941176], ["sailboats", 0.014705882352941176], ["strong", 0.014705882352941176], ["true", 0.014705882352941176], ["minute", 0.014705882352941176], ["hints", 0.014705882352941176], ["founded", 0.014705882352941176], ["bokononism", 0.014705882352941176], ["will", 0.014705882352941176], ["shameless", 0.014705882352941176], ["things", 0.014705882352941176], ["believed", 0.014705882352941176], ["finds", 0.014705882352941176], ["husband", 0.014705882352941176]], "sentiment": ["\u201cGive it to your husband or your minister to pass on to God,\u201d I said, \u201cand, when God finds a minute, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll explain this doghouse of mine in a way that even you can understand.\u201d\nShe fired me.

No industrial arts of any sort will ever again be practiced here.\nANDR\u00c9 LUTZ GAVE the new college all those bells, even though there was no place to hang them. He said he did it because he was so sure that it would 1 day be a great university with a bell tower and everything. He was dying of emphysema as a result of the fumes from molten metals that he had been breathing since he was 10 years old. He had no time to wait for a place to hang the most wonderful consequence of his having been alive for a little while, which was all those bells, bells, bells.\nThey were no surprise. They had been 18 months in the making. The founders whose work he supervised had shared his dreams of immortality as they made things as impractical and beautiful as bells, bells, bells.\nSo all the bells but 1 from a middle octave were slathered with grease to prevent their rusting and stored in 4 ranks in the estate\u2019s great barn, 200 meters from the mansion. The 1 bell that was going to get to sing at once was installed in the cupola of the mansion, with its rope running all the way down to the first floor. It would call people to classes and, if need be, also serve as a fire alarm.\nThe rest of the bells, it turned out, would slumber in the loft for 30 years, until 1899, when they were hanged as a family, the 1 from the cupola included, on axles in the belfry of the tower of a splendid library given to the school by the Moellenkamp family of Cleveland.\nThe Moellenkamps were also Tarkingtons, since the founder of their fortune had married a daughter of the illiterate Aaron Tarkington. Eleven of them so far had been dyslexic, and they had all gone to college in Scipio, since no other institution of higher learning would take them in.\nTHE FIRST MOELLENKAMP to graduate from here was Henry, who enrolled in 1875, when he was 19, and when the school was only 6 years old. It was at that time that its name was changed to Tarkington College. I have found the crumbling minutes of the Board of Trustees meeting at which that name change was made. Three of the 6 trustees were men who had married daughters of Aaron Tarkington, 1 of them the grandfather of Henry Moellenkamp. The other 3 trustees were the Mayor of Scipio, and a lawyer who looked after the Tarkington daughters\u2019 interests in the valley, and the area Congressman, who was surely the sisters\u2019 faithful servant, too, since they were partners with the college in his district\u2019s most important industries.\nAnd according to the minutes, which fell apart in my hands as I read them, it was the grandfather of young Henry Moellenkamp who proposed the name change, saying that \u201cThe Mohiga Valley Free Institute\u201d sounded too much like a poorhouse or a hospital. It is my guess that he would not have minded having the place sound like a catchment for the poor, if only he had not suffered the misfortune of having his own grandson go there.\nIT WAS IN that same year, 1875, that work began across the lake from Scipio, on a hilltop above Athena, on a prison camp for young criminals from big-city slums. It was believed that fresh air and the wonders of Nature would improve their souls and bodies to the point that they would find it natural to be good citizens.\nWHEN I CAME to work at Tarkington, there were only 30C students, a number that hadn\u2019t changed for 50 years. But the rustic work-camp across the lake had become a brutal fortress of iron and masonry on a naked hilltop, the New York State Maximum Security Adult Correctional Institution at Athena, keeping 5,000 of the state\u2019s worst criminals under lock and key.", 0.19403271848924017], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["groszinger", 0.05154639175257732], ["die", 0.041237113402061855], ["general", 0.030927835051546393], ["alle", 0.030927835051546393], ["omen", 0.030927835051546393], ["unendlichen", 0.030927835051546393], ["german", 0.020618556701030927], ["radio", 0.020618556701030927], ["operator", 0.020618556701030927], ["space", 0.020618556701030927], ["ganz", 0.020618556701030927], ["snapped", 0.020618556701030927], ["outer", 0.020618556701030927], ["calling", 0.020618556701030927], ["receiver", 0.020618556701030927], ["major", 0.010309278350515464], ["lieblingen", 0.010309278350515464], ["alles", 0.010309278350515464], ["blurted", 0.010309278350515464], ["goethe", 0.010309278350515464], ["accent", 0.010309278350515464], ["cheap", 0.010309278350515464], ["nervously", 0.010309278350515464], ["textbook", 0.010309278350515464], ["geben", 0.010309278350515464], ["scientist", 0.010309278350515464], ["hell", 0.010309278350515464], ["sounds", 0.010309278350515464], ["shrugged", 0.010309278350515464], ["ghosts", 0.010309278350515464], ["surprise", 0.010309278350515464], ["sat", 0.010309278350515464], ["sickening", 0.010309278350515464], ["stood", 0.010309278350515464], ["pep", 0.010309278350515464], ["continued", 0.010309278350515464], ["wound", 0.010309278350515464], ["sir", 0.010309278350515464], ["defiantly", 0.010309278350515464], ["laughed", 0.010309278350515464], ["freuden", 0.010309278350515464], ["threaten", 0.010309278350515464], ["rice", 0.010309278350515464], ["filled", 0.010309278350515464], ["schmerzen", 0.010309278350515464], ["ends", 0.010309278350515464], ["woman", 0.010309278350515464], ["glared", 0.010309278350515464], ["turned", 0.010309278350515464], ["mother", 0.010309278350515464], ["faintly", 0.010309278350515464], ["volume", 0.010309278350515464], ["hear", 0.010309278350515464], ["smiled", 0.010309278350515464], ["hands", 0.010309278350515464], ["voices", 0.010309278350515464], ["dr", 0.010309278350515464], ["quotation", 0.010309278350515464], ["shoulder", 0.010309278350515464], ["stunts", 0.010309278350515464], ["tter", 0.010309278350515464], ["cot", 0.010309278350515464], ["full", 0.010309278350515464], ["ihren", 0.010309278350515464], ["work", 0.010309278350515464], ["favorite", 0.010309278350515464], ["thought", 0.010309278350515464], ["switch", 0.010309278350515464], ["leaned", 0.010309278350515464], ["understand", 0.010309278350515464], ["voice", 0.010309278350515464], ["physics", 0.010309278350515464], ["hips", 0.010309278350515464]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThere\u2019s an old woman calling out something in a German accent.
