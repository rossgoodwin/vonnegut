The New York Times later described him as \u201cone of the most important figures in postwar America\u201d because of his impact on pop culture.\nDear Knox:\nThank you for the advance copy of Harvey Kurtzman\u2019s fast-acting Help. I admire it. I think I understand some of it.\nAs a test of my understanding, let\u2019s see if I can now sell an idea for money to Help. I offer the idea in the form of a letter which I would appreciate your forwarding. It goes as follows:\nDear Mr. Kurtzman:\nI have been a queasy fan of yours for a good while now. I would be enormously pleased if something of mine got into Help. Would the idea of shelter-hopping kits interest you? Families too big or too lazy or too poor to build adequate fall-out shelters could buy from our company quite cheap kits guaranteed to open any shelter yet recommended by Civil Defense.\nThe cheapest kit, selling for $14.95, say, would consist of a World War Two surplus cylinder of Cyklon B, guaranteed by I.G. Farben, and a shaped charge for blowing the lock on any shelter door. More luxurious kits might include C.D. uniforms, all-clear signals; tape recordings of beloved family pets scratching to be let in, tape recordings of old A.B.C. speeches on the harmlessness of fallout; grenades, bazookas, flamethrowers, etc.", 0.1774029356060606], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["father", 0.027777777777777776], ["brother", 0.020833333333333332], ["bernie", 0.020833333333333332], ["sleep", 0.013888888888888888], ["1940", 0.013888888888888888], ["big", 0.013888888888888888], ["school", 0.013888888888888888], ["ornamental", 0.013888888888888888], ["crown", 0.013888888888888888], ["college", 0.013888888888888888], ["reunion", 0.013888888888888888], ["allie", 0.013888888888888888], ["motel", 0.013888888888888888], ["won", 0.013888888888888888], ["hill", 0.013888888888888888], ["asked", 0.013888888888888888], ["people", 0.013888888888888888], ["high", 0.013888888888888888], ["education", 0.013888888888888888], ["class", 0.013888888888888888], ["johnson", 0.013888888888888888], ["looked", 0.013888888888888888], ["customary", 0.006944444444444444], ["congenially", 0.006944444444444444], ["money", 0.006944444444444444], ["agreed", 0.006944444444444444], ["chair", 0.006944444444444444], ["birds", 0.006944444444444444], ["cried", 0.006944444444444444], ["hunting", 0.006944444444444444], ["cemetery", 0.006944444444444444], ["young", 0.006944444444444444], ["better", 0.006944444444444444], ["slits", 0.006944444444444444], ["pretty", 0.006944444444444444], ["save", 0.006944444444444444], ["local", 0.006944444444444444], ["brown", 0.006944444444444444], ["swivel", 0.006944444444444444], ["returned", 0.006944444444444444], ["pull", 0.006944444444444444], ["bar", 0.006944444444444444], ["alex", 0.006944444444444444], ["university", 0.006944444444444444], ["courses", 0.006944444444444444], ["journalist", 0.006944444444444444], ["ohio", 0.006944444444444444], ["nice", 0.006944444444444444], ["economically", 0.006944444444444444], ["populated", 0.006944444444444444], ["lawyer", 0.006944444444444444], ["close", 0.006944444444444444], ["salesman", 0.006944444444444444], ["insurance", 0.006944444444444444], ["sorts", 0.006944444444444444], ["told", 0.006944444444444444], ["reporter", 0.006944444444444444], ["fred", 0.006944444444444444], ["harvard", 0.006944444444444444], ["wanted", 0.006944444444444444], ["sister", 0.006944444444444444], ["bates", 0.006944444444444444], ["career", 0.006944444444444444], ["times", 0.006944444444444444], ["amount", 0.006944444444444444], ["planned", 0.006944444444444444], ["soda", 0.006944444444444444], ["nearby", 0.006944444444444444], ["lectured", 0.006944444444444444], ["wilder", 0.006944444444444444], ["sweet", 0.006944444444444444], ["powerful", 0.006944444444444444], ["county", 0.006944444444444444], ["laugh", 0.006944444444444444], ["ton", 0.006944444444444444], ["lot", 0.006944444444444444], ["jane", 0.006944444444444444], ["friend", 0.006944444444444444], ["fiftieth", 0.006944444444444444], ["sort", 0.006944444444444444], ["eyes", 0.006944444444444444], ["defunct", 0.006944444444444444], ["uncle", 0.006944444444444444], ["baby", 0.006944444444444444], ["town", 0.006944444444444444], ["1990", 0.006944444444444444], ["bartender", 0.006944444444444444], ["work", 0.006944444444444444], ["matter", 0.006944444444444444], ["leaning", 0.006944444444444444], ["newspaper", 0.006944444444444444], ["called", 0.006944444444444444], ["rabbits", 0.006944444444444444], ["escape", 0.006944444444444444], ["skipping", 0.006944444444444444], ["thornton", 0.006944444444444444], ["gravity", 0.006944444444444444], ["comedians", 0.006944444444444444], ["speech", 0.006944444444444444], ["laughed", 0.006944444444444444], ["chemist", 0.006944444444444444], ["higher", 0.006944444444444444], ["shortridge", 0.006944444444444444], ["play", 0.006944444444444444], ["indianapolis", 0.006944444444444444], ["zanesville", 0.006944444444444444], ["office", 0.006944444444444444], ["knew", 0.006944444444444444], ["southern", 0.006944444444444444], ["adventure", 0.006944444444444444], ["characters", 0.006944444444444444], ["man", 0.006944444444444444], ["remember", 0.006944444444444444], ["daily", 0.006944444444444444], ["understand", 0.006944444444444444], ["democratic", 0.006944444444444444], ["scotch", 0.006944444444444444], ["talk", 0.006944444444444444]], "sentiment": ["Adventure!\nIt may be, too, that we wanted to escape the powerful pull, not of gravity, which is everywhere, but of Crown Hill Cemetery.\nCrown Hill got my sister Allie. It didn\u2019t get Jane. It won\u2019t get my big brother Bernie. It won\u2019t get me.\nI lectured in 1990 at a university in southern Ohio. They put me up in a motel nearby. When I returned to the motel after my speech, and was having my customary scotch and soda so I would sleep like a baby, which is the way I like to sleep, the bar was congenially populated by obviously local old people who seemed to really like each other. They had a lot to laugh about. They were all comedians.\nI asked the bartender who they were. He said they were the fiftieth reunion of the Class of 1940 of Zanesville High School. It sure looked nice. It sure looked right. I was in the Class of 1940 at Shortridge High School, and was then skipping my own reunion.\nThose people might have been characters out of Our Town by Thornton Wilder, as sweet a play as can ever be.\nThey and I were so old that we could remember when it didn\u2019t matter all that much economically whether you did or didn\u2019t go to college. You could still amount to something. And I told my father back then that maybe I didn\u2019t want to become a chemist like my big brother Bernie. I could save him a ton of money if I went to work for a newspaper instead.\nUnderstand: I could go to college only if I took the same sorts of courses my brother had. Father and Bernie were agreed on that. Any other sort of higher education was what they both called ornamental.

He was sort of glassy-eyed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they pinned a target to him?\u201d\n\u201cA piece of paper,\u201d said Billy. He got out of bed, said, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d went into the darkness of the bathroom to take a leak. He groped for the light, realized as he felt the rough walls that he had traveled back to 1944, to the prison hospital again.\nThe candle in the hospital had gone out. Poor old Edgar Derby had fallen asleep on the cot next to Billy\u2019s. Billy was out of bed, groping along a wall, trying to find a way out because he had to take a leak so badly.\nHe suddenly found a door, which opened, let him reel out into the prison night. Billy was loony with time-travel and morphine. He delivered himself to a barbed-wire fence which snagged him in a dozen places. Billy tried to back away from it, but the barbs wouldn\u2019t let go. So Billy did a silly little dance with the fence, taking a step this way, then that way, then returning to the beginning again.\nA Russian, himself out in the night to take a leak, saw Billy dancing\u2014from the other side of the fence. He came over to the curious scarecrow, tried to talk with it gently, asked it what country it was from. The scarecrow paid no attention, went on dancing. So the Russian undid the snags one by one, and the scarecrow danced off into the night again without a word of thanks.\nThe Russian waved to him, and called after him in Russian, \u201cGood-bye.\u201d\nBilly took his pecker out, there in the prison night, and peed and peed on the ground. Then he put it away again, more or less, and contemplated a new problem: Where had he come from, and where should he go now?\nSomewhere in the night there were cries of grief. With nothing better to do, Billy shuffled in their direction. He wondered what tragedy so many had found to lament out of doors.", 0.006549873737373739], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["unk", 0.08917197452229299], ["paradise", 0.025477707006369428], ["uniform", 0.01910828025477707], ["thumbnail", 0.01910828025477707], ["cigarette", 0.01910828025477707], ["barrel", 0.01910828025477707], ["brackman", 0.012738853503184714], ["patch", 0.012738853503184714], ["vision", 0.012738853503184714], ["bore", 0.012738853503184714], ["moonmist", 0.012738853503184714], ["moon", 0.012738853503184714], ["knew", 0.012738853503184714], ["golden", 0.012738853503184714], ["boaz", 0.012738853503184714], ["sunlight", 0.012738853503184714], ["oily", 0.012738853503184714], ["smoking", 0.012738853503184714], ["three", 0.012738853503184714], ["girl", 0.012738853503184714], ["pink", 0.012738853503184714], ["squadmates", 0.012738853503184714], ["felt", 0.012738853503184714], ["response", 0.012738853503184714], ["impression", 0.006369426751592357], ["gold", 0.006369426751592357], ["rod", 0.006369426751592357], ["yellow", 0.006369426751592357], ["years", 0.006369426751592357], ["including", 0.006369426751592357], ["find", 0.006369426751592357], ["perfect", 0.006369426751592357], ["muzzle", 0.006369426751592357], ["slow", 0.006369426751592357], ["thumb", 0.006369426751592357], ["crawl", 0.006369426751592357], ["young", 0.006369426751592357], ["better", 0.006369426751592357], ["going", 0.006369426751592357], ["black", 0.006369426751592357], ["rosy", 0.006369426751592357], ["surprised", 0.006369426751592357], ["finer", 0.006369426751592357], ["brown", 0.006369426751592357], ["good", 0.006369426751592357], ["puzzled", 0.006369426751592357], ["fat", 0.006369426751592357], ["pocket", 0.006369426751592357], ["breast", 0.006369426751592357], ["day", 0.006369426751592357], ["private", 0.006369426751592357], ["stuff", 0.006369426751592357], ["round", 0.006369426751592357], ["stately", 0.006369426751592357], ["suspect", 0.006369426751592357], ["rifling", 0.006369426751592357], ["stared", 0.006369426751592357], ["hours", 0.006369426751592357], ["eye", 0.006369426751592357], ["permitted", 0.006369426751592357], ["shaken", 0.006369426751592357], ["colored", 0.006369426751592357], ["withdrew", 0.006369426751592357], ["soldier", 0.006369426751592357], ["twenty", 0.006369426751592357], ["loud", 0.006369426751592357], ["asked", 0.006369426751592357], ["cleaning", 0.006369426751592357], ["slipped", 0.006369426751592357], ["stitched", 0.006369426751592357], ["rank", 0.006369426751592357], ["negative", 0.006369426751592357], ["dreaming", 0.006369426751592357], ["clarity", 0.006369426751592357], ["open", 0.006369426751592357], ["heads", 0.006369426751592357], ["army", 0.006369426751592357], ["positive", 0.006369426751592357], ["caught", 0.006369426751592357], ["question", 0.006369426751592357], ["spiral", 0.006369426751592357], ["class", 0.006369426751592357], ["regulation", 0.006369426751592357], ["sergeant", 0.006369426751592357], ["mars", 0.006369426751592357], ["white", 0.006369426751592357], ["immaculate", 0.006369426751592357], ["happy", 0.006369426751592357], ["happily", 0.006369426751592357], ["exactly", 0.006369426751592357], ["huh", 0.006369426751592357], ["warm", 0.006369426751592357], ["rifle", 0.006369426751592357], ["nodded", 0.006369426751592357], ["women", 0.006369426751592357], ["kind", 0.006369426751592357], ["beautiful", 0.006369426751592357], ["shrewd", 0.006369426751592357], ["suspicions", 0.006369426751592357], ["lichen", 0.006369426751592357], ["thought", 0.006369426751592357], ["authoritative", 0.006369426751592357], ["gate", 0.006369426751592357], ["sell", 0.006369426751592357], ["thrilled", 0.006369426751592357], ["beauty", 0.006369426751592357], ["breech", 0.006369426751592357], ["nods", 0.006369426751592357], ["man", 0.006369426751592357], ["tailored", 0.006369426751592357], ["land", 0.006369426751592357], ["looked", 0.006369426751592357], ["person", 0.006369426751592357], ["green", 0.006369426751592357], ["left", 0.006369426751592357]], "sentiment": ["\"Thanks,\" said Unk.\n\"This man done all right, didn\u2019t he?\" Brackman asked Unk\u2019s squadmates.\nThere had been some nods, but Unk had the impression that his squadmates would have nodded in response to any positive question, would have shaken their heads in response to any negative one.\nUnk withdrew the rod and patch, slipped his thumb under the open breech, caught the sunlight on his oily thumbnail. The thumbnail sent the sunlight up the bore. Unk put his eye to the muzzle and was thrilled by perfect beauty. He could have stared happily at the immaculate spiral of the rifling for hours, dreaming of the happy land whose round gate he saw at the other end of the bore. The pink under his oily thumbnail at the far end of the barrel made that far end seem a rosy paradise indeed. Some day he was going to crawl down the barrel to that paradise.\nIt would be warm there\u2014and there would be only one moon, Unk thought, and the moon would be fat, stately, and slow. Something else about the pink paradise at the end of the barrel came to Unk, and Unk was puzzled by the clarity of the vision. There were three beautiful women in that paradise, and Unk knew exactly what they looked like! One was white, one was gold, and one was brown. The golden girl was smoking a cigarette in Unk\u2019s vision. Unk was further surprised to find that he even knew what kind of cigarette the golden girl was smoking.\nIt was a MoonMist Cigarette.\n\"Sell MoonMist,\" Unk said out loud. It felt good to say that\u2014felt authoritative, shrewd.\n\"Huh?\" said a young colored soldier, cleaning his rifle next to Unk. \"What\u2019s that you say, Unk?\" he said.

This gave her the opportunity to say that the natural order had dealt harshly with such tortoises long before there was such an animal as man.\nThere used to be millions of them, lumbering over every temperate land mass of any size, she would say.\nBut then some tiny animals evolved into rodents. These easily found and ate the eggs of the tortoises\u2014all of the eggs.\nSo, very quickly, that was that for the tortoises everywhere, except for those on a few islands which remained rodent free.\nIt was prophetic that Mary should imagine herself to be a land tortoise as she suffocated, since something very much like what had happened to most of the land tortoises so long ago was then beginning to happen to most of humankind.\nSome new creature, invisible to the naked eye, was eating up all the eggs in human ovaries, starting at the annual Book Fair at Frankfurt, Germany. Women at the fair were experiencing a slight fever, which came and went in a day or two, and sometimes blurry vision. After that, they would be just like Mary Hepburn: They couldn\u2019t have babies anymore. Nor would any way be discovered for stopping this disease. It would spread practically everywhere.\nThe near extinction of mighty land tortoises by little rodents was certainly a David-and-Goliath story. Now here was another one.\nYes, and Mary came close enough to death to see the blue tunnel into the Afterlife. At that point, she rebelled against her big brain, which had brought her that far. She unwrapped the garment bag from her head, and, instead of dying, she went downstairs, where she found James Wait feeding peanuts and olives and maraschino cherries and cocktail onions from behind the bar to the six Kanka-bono girls.\nThis tableau of clumsy charity would remain imprinted in her brain for the rest of her life. She would believe ever after that he was an unselfish, compassionate, lovable human being. He was about to suffer a fatal heart attack, so nothing would ever happen to revise her high opinion of this loathsome man.\nOn top of everything else, this man was a murderer.", 0.06707873376623379], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["leaving", 0.03333333333333333], ["cook", 0.03333333333333333], ["bed", 0.03333333333333333], ["morning", 0.03333333333333333], ["groggily", 0.016666666666666666], ["talked", 0.016666666666666666], ["proved", 0.016666666666666666], ["rubbing", 0.016666666666666666], ["fall", 0.016666666666666666], ["matter", 0.016666666666666666], ["gently", 0.016666666666666666], ["years", 0.016666666666666666], ["staying", 0.016666666666666666], ["asleep", 0.016666666666666666], ["promised", 0.016666666666666666], ["oven", 0.016666666666666666], ["wasn", 0.016666666666666666], ["table", 0.016666666666666666], ["appetite", 0.016666666666666666], ["hate", 0.016666666666666666], ["drinks", 0.016666666666666666], ["soldier", 0.016666666666666666], ["notice", 0.016666666666666666], ["god", 0.016666666666666666], ["note", 0.016666666666666666], ["music", 0.016666666666666666], ["mama", 0.016666666666666666], ["learned", 0.016666666666666666], ["care", 0.016666666666666666], ["slazinger", 0.016666666666666666], ["celeste", 0.016666666666666666], ["circe", 0.016666666666666666], ["weeks", 0.016666666666666666], ["life", 0.016666666666666666], ["good", 0.016666666666666666], ["listened", 0.016666666666666666], ["civilian", 0.016666666666666666], ["night", 0.016666666666666666], ["stay", 0.016666666666666666], ["allison", 0.016666666666666666], ["supper", 0.016666666666666666], ["news", 0.016666666666666666], ["white", 0.016666666666666666], ["kitchen", 0.016666666666666666], ["ate", 0.016666666666666666], ["neck", 0.016666666666666666], ["stiff", 0.016666666666666666], ["dancing", 0.016666666666666666], ["will", 0.016666666666666666], ["thing", 0.016666666666666666], ["bad", 0.016666666666666666], ["berman", 0.016666666666666666], ["professional", 0.016666666666666666], ["awakened", 0.016666666666666666], ["spend", 0.016666666666666666], ["karabekian", 0.016666666666666666]], "sentiment": ["There was a note on the kitchen table from the cook, from Allison White, saying my supper was in the oven.

facts done to him? They have required that he respond to them, since he is a man of good will. And responding and responding and responding to them has left him petrified with boredom and drained of any capacity for joyfulness, now that he is deep into middle age.\nOnly one fact among the millions is clearly horrible. Only one distinguishes Slocum\u2019s bad luck from that of his neighbors. His youngest child is an incurable imbecile.\nSlocum is heartless about the child. \u201cI no longer think of Derek as one of my children,\u201d he says. \u201cOr even as mine. I try not to think of him at all. This is becoming easier, even at home when he is nearby with the rest of us, making noise with some red cradle toy or making unintelligible sounds as he endeavors to speak. By now I don\u2019t even know his name. The children don\u2019t care for him either.\u201d\nMr. Heller might have here, or at least somewhere in his book, used conventional, Chekhovian techniques for making us love a sometimes wicked man. He might have said that Slocum was drunk or tired after a bad day at the office when he spoke so heartlessly, or that he whispered his heartlessness only to himself or to a stranger he would never see again. But Slocum is invariably sober and deliberate during his monologue, and does not seem to give a damn who hears what he says. Judging from his selection of unromantic episodes and attitudes it is his wish that we dislike him.\nAnd we gratify that wish.\nIs this book any good? Yes. It is splendidly put together and hypnotic to read. It is as clear and hard-edged as a cut diamond. Mr. Heller\u2019s concentration and patience are so evident on every page that one can only say that Something Happened is at all points precisely what he hoped it would be.\nThe book may be marketed under false pretenses, which is all right with me. I have already seen British sales promotion materials which suggest that we have been ravenous for a new Heller book because we want to laugh some more. This is as good a way as any to get people to read one of the unhappiest books ever written.\nSomething Happened is so astonishingly pessimistic, in fact, that it can be called a daring experiment. Depictions of utter hopelessness in literature have been acceptable up to now only in small doses, in short-story form, as in Franz Kafka\u2019s \u2019The Metamorphosis,\u201d Shirley Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Lottery,\u201d or John D. MacDonald\u2019s \u201cThe Hangover,\u201d to name a treasured few. As far as I know, though, Joseph Heller is the first major American writer to deal with unrelieved misery at novel length. Even more rashly, he leaves his chief character, Slocum, essentially unchanged at the end.\nA middle-aged woman who had just finished Something Happened in galleys said to me the other day that she thought it was a reply to all the recent books by women about the unrewardingness of housewives\u2019 lives. And Slocum does seem to argue that he is entitled to at least as much unhappiness as any woman he knows. His wife, after all, has to adapt to only one sort of hell, the domestic torture chamber in Connecticut, in which he, too, must writhe at night and on weekends, when he isn\u2019t committing adultery. But he must go regularly to his office, where pain is inflicted on all the nerve centers which were neglected by the tormentors at home.\n(The place where Slocum works, incidentally, is unnamed, and its products and services are undescribed. But I had a friend of a friend of an acquaintance ask Mr. Heller if he minded naming Slocum\u2019s employers. Mr. Heller replied with all possible speed and openness, \u201cTime, Incorporated.\u201d So we have a small scoop.)", 0.0092602613435947], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["hostetter", 0.1590909090909091], ["dead", 0.09090909090909091], ["amy", 0.06818181818181818], ["woman", 0.045454545454545456], ["record", 0.045454545454545456], ["barrels", 0.022727272727272728], ["wedge", 0.022727272727272728], ["nerve", 0.022727272727272728], ["mackerel", 0.022727272727272728], ["turned", 0.022727272727272728], ["angrily", 0.022727272727272728], ["walk", 0.022727272727272728], ["murmured", 0.022727272727272728], ["blank", 0.022727272727272728], ["existence", 0.022727272727272728], ["expressions", 0.022727272727272728], ["stood", 0.022727272727272728], ["shuffling", 0.022727272727272728], ["began", 0.022727272727272728], ["frail", 0.022727272727272728], ["door", 0.022727272727272728], ["business", 0.022727272727272728], ["gray", 0.022727272727272728], ["aimless", 0.022727272727272728], ["room", 0.022727272727272728], ["older", 0.022727272727272728], ["light", 0.022727272727272728], ["wife", 0.022727272727272728], ["face", 0.022727272727272728], ["stopped", 0.022727272727272728], ["talk", 0.022727272727272728]], "sentiment": ["In the wedge of frail gray light let in by the door stood Miss Hostetter.\nEach woman seemed to look through the other, to wish her out of existence.

Lila's interest in the books was commercial. At thirteen, she was Pisquontuit's leading dealer in smut.\nShe was a dealer in fireworks, too, for the same reason she was a dealer in smut, which was: Profit. Her playmates at the Pisquontuit Yacht Club and Pisquontuit Country Day School were so rich and foolish that they would pay her almost anything for almost anything. In a routine business day, she might sell a seventy-five-cent copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover for ten dollars and a fifteen-cent cherry bomb for five.\nShe bought her fireworks during family vacations in Canada and Florida and Hong Kong. Most of her smut came from the open stock of the news store. The thing was, Lila knew which titles were red hot, which was more than her playmates or the employees of the news store knew. And Lila bought the hot ones as fast as they were tucked into the Lazy Susan. All her transactions were with the idiot behind the lunch counter, who forgot everything faster than it could happen.\nThe relationship between Lila and the news store was wonderfully symbiotic, for hanging in the store's front window was a large medallion of gilded polystyrene, awarded by the Rhode Island Mothers to Save Children from Filth. Representatives of that group inspected the store's paperback selection regularly. The polystyrene medallion was their admission that they had not found one filthy thing.", 0.06926020408163266], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["father",

That would keep him out of the armed forces in the Second World War. He would work as a welder in a Boston shipyard, instead. I would lose touch with him. Sarah, whom I see regularly again, told me that he died of a heart attack in Nineteen-hundred and Sixty-five\u2014in a cluttered little welding shop he ran singlehanded in the village of Sandwich, on Cape Cod.\nHis name was Radford Alden Wyatt. He never married. According to Sarah, he had not bathed in years.\n\u201cShirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations,\u201d as the saying goes.\nIn the case of the Wyatts, actually, it was more like shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in ten generations. They had been richer than most of their neighbors for at least that long. Sarah\u2019s father was now selling off at rock-bottom prices all the treasures his ancestors had accumulated\u2014English pewter, silver by Paul Revere, paintings of Wyatts as sea captains and merchants and preachers and lawyers, treasures from the China Trade.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so awful to see my father so low all the time,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cIs your father low, too?\u201d\nShe was speaking of my fictitious father, the curator of Mr. McCone\u2019s art collection. I could see him quite clearly then. I can\u2019t see him at all now. \u201cNo,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d I said. My real father was in fact in easy circumstances. My mother and he had been able to bank almost every penny they made, and the bank they put their money in had not failed.\n\u201cIf only people wouldn\u2019t care so much about money,\u201d she said. \u201cI keep telling father that I don\u2019t care about it. I don\u2019t care about not going to Europe anymore. I hate school. I don\u2019t want to go there anymore. I\u2019m not learning anything. I\u2019m glad we sold our boats. I was bored with them, anyway. I don\u2019t need any clothes. I have enough clothes to last me a hundred years. He just won\u2019t believe me. \u2018I\u2019ve let you down. I\u2019ve let everybody down,\u2019 he says.\u201d\nHer father, incidentally, was an inactive partner in the Wyatt Clock Company. This did not limit his liability in the radium-poisoning case, but his principal activity in the good old days had been as the largest yacht broker in Massachusetts. That business was utterly shot in Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-one, of course. And it, too, in the process of dying, left him with what he once described to me as \u201c\u2026 a pile of worthless accounts-receivable as high as Mount Washington, and a pile of bills as high as Pike\u2019s Peak.\u201d", -0.008992063492063489], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["minton", 0.10344827586206896], ["gratifying", 0.10344827586206896], ["people", 0.06896551724137931], ["speak", 0.06896551724137931], ["heart", 0.034482758620689655], ["manuscript", 0.034482758620689655], ["nationalities", 0.034482758620689655], ["chair", 0.034482758620689655], ["arm", 0.034482758620689655], ["travels", 0.034482758620689655], ["languages", 0.034482758620689655], ["instance", 0.034482758620689655], ["spread", 0.034482758620689655], ["lot", 0.034482758620689655], ["emptily", 0.034482758620689655], ["reading", 0.034482758620689655], ["fat", 0.034482758620689655], ["typewritten", 0.034482758620689655], ["hm", 0.034482758620689655], ["wide", 0.034482758620689655], ["wife", 0.034482758620689655], ["suppose", 0.034482758620689655], ["asked", 0.034482758620689655]], "sentiment": ["For instance: \u201cI suppose you can speak a lot of languages,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOh, six or seven\u2014between us,\u201d said Minton.\n\u201cThat must be very gratifying.\u201d\n\u201cWhat must?\u201d\n\u201cBeing able to speak to people of so many different nationalities.\u201d\n\u201cVery gratifying,\u201d said Minton emptily.\n\u201cVery gratifying,\u201d said his wife.\nAnd they went back to reading a fat, typewritten manuscript that was spread across the chair arm between them.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d I said a little later, \u201cin all your wide travels, have you found people everywhere about the same at heart?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d asked Minton.", 0.08124999999999999], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["finnerty", 0.06], ["paul", 0.04], ["edge", 0.03], ["barely", 0.02], ["idea", 0.02], ["things", 0.02], ["man", 0.02], ["center", 0.02], ["insane", 0.01], ["discontent", 0.01], ["fantastic", 0.01], ["tasted", 0.01], ["ten", 0.01], ["people", 0.01], ["moments", 0.01], ["alternately", 0.01], ["dead", 0.01], ["relative", 0.01], ["lips", 0.01], ["savoring", 0.01], ["kill", 0.01], ["touch", 0.01], ["close", 0.01], ["turn", 0.01], ["hammer", 0.01], ["outward", 0.01], ["help", 0.01], ["albany", 0.01], ["guess", 0.01], ["suicide", 0.01], ["spoke", 0.01], ["bottom", 0.01], ["dinner", 0.01], ["long", 0.01], ["good", 0.01], ["spoken", 0.01], ["laid", 0.01], ["going", 0.01], ["black", 0.01], ["calm", 0.01], ["tranquility", 0.01], ["test", 0.01], ["shared", 0.01], ["learned", 0.01], ["reflex", 0.01], ["hand", 0.01], ["listen", 0.01], ["ago", 0.01], ["head", 0.01], ["oil", 0.01], ["kinds", 0.01], ["big", 0.01], ["psychiatrist", 0.01], ["morbid", 0.01], ["felt", 0.01], ["park", 0.01], ["seemingly", 0.01], ["stay", 0.01], ["driven", 0.01], ["undreamed", 0.01], ["shoulder", 0.01], ["mouth", 0.01], ["pleasure", 0.01], ["pull", 0.01], ["wanted", 0.01], ["nodded", 0.01], ["thoughts", 0.01], ["shoot", 0.01], ["reaction", 0.01], ["brilliant", 0.01], ["pretend", 0.01], ["metal", 0.01], ["inner", 0.01], ["matter", 0.01], ["licked", 0.01], ["place", 0.01], ["dispassionately", 0.01], ["fought", 0.01], ["factly", 0.01], ["barrel", 0.01], ["shook", 0.01], ["minutes", 0.01], ["iroquois", 0.01], ["suddenly", 0.01], ["left", 0.01]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYou?

So I ask again, am I the only one this was done to, and if so, why?\u201d\nHe froze.\n\u201cMadelaine?\u201d I said to Madelaine Astor, who would later write me such a dumb letter.\nShe said she did not like it that I had told students that a new Ice Age was on its way, even if I had read it in The New York Times.

They got me on a Friday, late in the afternoon, so I couldn\u2019t have a hearing in court until Monday. So I sat there in the calaboose for two days, with nothing to do but read my toilet paper. I can still remember one of the stories I read.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d said Trout.\n\u201cThat was the last story I ever read,\u201d said the driver. \u201cMy God\u2014that must be all of fifteen years ago. The story was about another planet. It was a crazy story. They had museums full of paintings all over the place, and the government used a kind of roulette wheel to decide what to put in the museums, and what to throw out.\u201d\nKilgore Trout was suddenly woozy with d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The truck driver was reminding him of the premise of a book he hadn\u2019t thought about for years. The driver\u2019s toilet paper in Libertyville, Georgia, had been The Barring-gaffner of Bagnialto, or This Yearns Masterpiece, by Kilgore Trout.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe name of the planet where Trout\u2019s book took place was Bagnialto, and a \u201cBarring-gaffner\u201d there was a government official who spun a wheel of chance once a year. Citizens submitted works of art to the government, and these were given numbers, and then they were assigned cash values according to the Barring-gaffner\u2019s spins of the wheel.\nThe viewpoint of character of the tale was not the Barring-gaffner, but a humble cobbler named Gooz. Gooz lived alone, and he painted a picture of his cat. It was the only picture he had ever painted. He took it to the Barring-gaffner, who numbered it and put it in a warehouse crammed with works of art.\nThe painting by Gooz had an unprecedented gush of luck on the wheel. It became worth eighteen thousand lambos, the equivalent of one billion dollars on Earth. The Barring-gaffner awarded Gooz a check for that amount, most of which was taken back at once by the tax collector. The picture was given a place of honor in the National Gallery, and people lined up for miles for a chance to see a painting worth a billion dollars.\nThere was also a huge bonfire of all the paintings and statues and books and so on which the wheel had said were worthless.
