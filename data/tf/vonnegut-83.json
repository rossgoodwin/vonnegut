fallen steel front door and frame, which said \u201cUCK AR.\u201d Since there were crystal shards atop the door and frame instead of underneath them, a forensic scientist would have had to testify in a lawsuit, if one had ever been filed against the crooked contractor, that, the crook\u2019s handiwork fell first. The chandelier must have dangled for a second or so before letting gravity do to it what gravity apparently would have liked to do to simply everything.\nThe smoke alarm in the picture gallery was still ringing, \u201cpresumably,\u201d Trout would later say, \u201ccontinuing to do so of its own free will.\u201d He was joking, making fun, as was his wont, of the idea that there had ever been free will for anyone or anything, rerun or not.\nThe Academy doorbell had clammed up the moment Zoltan Pepper was hit by the fire truck. Trout\u2019s words again: \u201cQuoth the doorbell with its silence, \u2018No comment at this time.\u2019 \u201d\nTrout himself, as I\u2019ve said, was nevertheless espousing free will when he entered the Academy, and was invoking the Judeo-Christian deity as well: \u201cWake up! For God\u2019s sake, wake up, wake up! Free will! Free will!\u201d\nHe would say at Xanadu that even if he had been a hero that afternoon and night, his entering the Academy, \u201cpretending,\u201d in his words, \u201cto be Paul Revere in the space-time continuum,\u201d had been \u201can act of sheer cowardice.\u201d\nHe was seeking shelter from the growing din on Broadway, half a block away, and from the sounds of really serious explosions from other parts of the city. A mile and a half to the south, near Grant\u2019s Tomb, a massive Department of Sanitation truck, for want of sincere steering, plowed through the lobby of a condominium and into the apartment of the building superintendent. It knocked over his gas range. The ruptured pipe of that major appliance filled the stairwell and elevator shaft of the six-story structure with methane laced with skunk smell. Most of the tenants were on Social Security.\nAnd then KA-BOOM!\n\u201cAn accident waiting to happen,\u201d as Kilgore Trout would say at Xanadu.", 0.1899038461538462], "title": "Timequake"},

his third wife, Genevi\u00e8ve. They lived in the Village, and I slept on their couch. Felix was only thirty-four, but he was already general manager of radio station WOR, and was about to head up the television department of Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn, the advertising agency. He was already having his clothes made in London.\nAnd Katmandu opened and closed in a single night. This was my one fling away from Midland City, my one experience, until now, with inhabiting a place where I was not Deadeye Dick.\n16\nTHE NEW YORK CITY critics found it hilarious that the author of Katmandu held a degree in pharmacy from Ohio State University. They found it obvious, too, that I had never seen India or Nepal, where half my play took place. How delicious they would have found it, if only they had known, that I had begun to write the play when I was only a junior in high school. How pathetic they would have found it, if only they had known, that I had been told that I should become a writer, that I had the divine spark, by a high school English teacher who had never been anywhere, either, who had never seen anything important, either, who had no sex life, either. And what a perfect name she had for a role like that: Naomi Shoup.\nShe took pity on me, and on herself, too, I\u2019m sure. What awful lives we had! She was old and alone, and considered to be ridiculous for finding joy on a printed page. I was a social leper. I would have had no time for friends anyway. I went food shopping right after school, and started supper as soon as I got home. I did the laundry in the broken-down Maytag wringer-washer in the furnace room. I served supper to Mother and Father, and sometimes guests, and cleaned up afterwards. There would be dirty dishes from breakfast and lunch as well.\nI did my homework until I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open any longer, and then I collapsed into bed. I often slept in my clothing. And then I got up at six in the morning and did the ironing and vacuuming. And then I served breakfast to Mother and Father, and put a hot lunch for them in the oven. And then I made all the beds and I went to school.\n\u201cAnd what are your parents up to while you\u2019re doing all that housework?\u201d Miss Shoup asked me. She had summoned me from a study hall, where I had been fast asleep, to a conference in her tiny office. There was a photograph of Edna St. Vincent Millay on her wall. She had to tell me who she was.\nI was too embarrassed to tell old Miss Shoup the truth about what Mother and Father did with their time. They were zombies. They were in bathrobes and bedroom slippers all day long\u2014unless company was expected. They stared into the distance a lot. Sometimes they would hug each other very lightly and sigh. They were the walking dead.\nThe next time Hippolyte Paul De Mille offers to raise a corpse for my amusement, I will say to him, \u201cIt is nothing I do not see yesterday.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.06407647907647908], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["compliment", 0.06666666666666667], ["hope", 0.06666666666666667], ["heart", 0.03333333333333333], ["studied", 0.03333333333333333], ["german", 0.03333333333333333], ["son", 0.03333333333333333], ["hate", 0.03333333333333333], ["happiness", 0.03333333333333333], ["wanted", 0.03333333333333333], ["missed", 0.03333333333333333], ["deserve", 0.03333333333333333], ["outsiders", 0.03333333333333333], ["happy", 0.03333333333333333], ["listened", 0.03333333333333333], ["broadcast", 0.03333333333333333], ["germany", 0.03333333333333333], ["broke", 0.03333333333333333], ["law", 0.03333333333333333], ["easily", 0.03333333333333333], ["understands", 0.03333333333333333], ["daughter", 0.03333333333333333], ["country", 0.03333333333333333], ["married", 0.03333333333333333], ["war", 0.03333333333333333], ["soldier", 0.03333333333333333], ["place", 0.03333333333333333], ["hated", 0.03333333333333333], ["misunderstood", 0.03333333333333333]], "sentiment": ["\u201cGermany is the most misunderstood country in the world,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou are one of the few outsiders who really understands us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI hope that\u2019s a compliment I deserve,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment you didn\u2019t come by very easily,\u201d he said. \u201cYou broke my heart when you married my daughter.

When this horrifying military freak leapt out at the little girls with all his killing equipment, they were too hungry and too resigned to death to run away. They opened their mouths instead\u2014and rolled their brown eyes, and patted their stomachs, and pointed down their gullets to show how hungry they were.\nChildren all over the world were doing that back then, and not just in that one back alley in Ecuador.\nSo Delgado just kept going, and he was never caught and punished or hospitalized or whatever. He was just one more soldier in a city teeming with soldiers, and nobody had gotten a good look at his face, which, in the shadow of his steel helmet, wasn\u2019t all that different from anybody else\u2019s face anyway. And, like the great survivor he was, he would rape a woman the next day and become the father of one of the last ten million children or so to be born on the South American mainland.\nAfter he was gone, the six little girls went into the shop, seeking food or anything which might be traded for food. These were orphans from the Ecuadorian rain forest across the mountains to the east\u2014from far, far away. Their parents had all been killed by insecticides sprayed from the air, and a bush pilot had brought them to Guayaquil, where they had become children of the streets.\nThese children were predominantly Indian, but had Negro ancestors as well\u2014African slaves who had escaped into the rain forest long ago.\nThese were Kanka-bonos.

Not really. Most writers are not quickwitted when they talk. Novelists in particular, as I have said before, drag themselves around in society like gut-shot bears. The good ones do.\nSome people say that my friend Gore Vidal, who once suggested in an interview that I was the worst writer in the United States, is witty.

The only light now came from the orange fires of furnaces in the distance.\nTrembling, she opened the bottom drawer of her desk, and found the record gone.\nStunned and angry, she opened Miss Hostetter\u2019s bottom drawer. The record was there. The only other objects in the green steel bin were a bottle of Mercurochrome and a clipping from the Montezuma Minutes, entitled, \u201cCreed of a Woman of Montezuma.\u201d \u201cI am a Woman of Montezuma,\u201d the creed began, \u201chand in hand with Men, marching to a Better Tomorrow under the three banners of God, Country, and Company, bearing the proud shield of Service.\u201d\nAmy wailed in anguish. She ran out of the girl pool, down the iron stairway, and down the company street to the main gate, to the headquarters of the company police. She was sure Miss Hostetter was there, proudly telling the police what she\u2019d learned from the record.\nThe headquarters of the company police were in one corner of a great reception room by the main gate. Around the walls of the room were exhibits of the company\u2019s products and methods. In its center was a stand, where a fat concessionaire sold candy, tobacco, and magazines.\nA tall woman in a cloth coat was talking animatedly to the policeman on duty.\n\u201cMiss Hostetter!\u201d said Amy breathlessly, coming up behind her.\nThe woman turned to look curiously at my wife-to-be, and then returned her attention to the policeman. She was not Miss Hostetter. She was a visitor, who had taken a tour of the works and lost her purse inside.\n\u201cIt could have been lost or stolen just anywhere,\u201d said the woman, \u201cwhere all that terrible noise was, with all the hot steel and sparks; where that big hammer came crashing down; where that scientist showed us his whatchamacallit in his laboratory\u2014anywhere!

candid photography. All sincere letters answered. All snaps returned, said another.\nMale preparatory school teacher badly needs course in manners from stern instructress, preferably a horse-lover of German or Scandinavian extraction, said another. Will travel anywhere in U.S.\nNew York top exec wants dates weekday afternoons. No prudes, said another.\nOn the facing page was a large coupon on which a reader was invited to write an ad of his own. Fred sort of hankered to.\nFred turned the page, read an account of a rape-murder that happened in Nebraska in 1933. The illustrations were revoltingly clinical photographs that only a coroner had a right to see. The rape-murder was thirty years old when Fred read of it, when The Investigator's reputedly ten million readers read of it. The issues with which the paper dealt were eternal. Lucretia Borgia could make screaming headlines at any time. It was from The Investigator, in fact, that Fred, who had attended Princeton for only a year, had learned of the death of Socrates.\nA thirteen-year-old girl came into the store, and Fred thrust the paper aside. The girl was Lila Buntline, daughter of his wife's best friend. Lila was a tall creature, horse-faced, knobby. There were great circles under her perfectly beautiful green eyes. Her face was piebald with sunburn and tan and freckles and pink new skin. She was the most competitive and skilful sailor in the Pisquontuit Yacht Club.\nLila glanced at Fred with pity\u2014because he was poor, because his wife was no good, because he was fat, because he was a bore. And she strode to the magazine and book racks, put herself out of sight by sitting on the cold cement floor.\nFred retrieved The Investigator, looked at ads that offered to sell him all sorts of dirty things. His breathing was shallow. Poor Fred had a damp, junior high school enthusiasm for The Investigator and all it stood for, but lacked the nerve to become a part of it, to correspond with all the box numbers there. Since he was the son of a suicide, it was hardly surprising that his secret hankerings were embarrassing and small.\nA very healthy man now banged into the news store, moved to Fred's side so quickly that Fred couldn't throw the paper away. \"Why, you filthy-minded insurance bastard,\" said the newcomer cheerfully, \"what you doing reading a jerk-off paper like that?\"\nHe was Harry Pena, a professional fisherman. He was also Chief of the Pisquontuit Volunteer Fire Department. Harry had two fish traps offshore, labyrinths of pilings and nets that took heartless advantage of the stupidity of fish. Each trap was a long fence in the water, with dry land at one end and a circular corral of stakes and netting at the other. Fish seeking a way around the fence entered the corral. Stupidly, they circled the corral again and again and again, until Harry and his two big sons came in their boat, with gaffhooks and malls, closed the gate of the corral, hauled up a purse net lying on the bottom, and killed and killed and killed.", 0.09313668600902648], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["sarah", 0.03896103896103896], ["wyatt",

Sarah\u2019s family was in the middle of it, and sick about it. Sarah had already told me that she was sick about it, and so had her brother, my roommate, and so had their father and mother. The tragedy was a slow one that could not be stopped once it had begun, and it began in the family\u2019s clock company, the Wyatt Clock Company, one of the oldest companies in the United States, in Brockton, Massachusetts. It was an avoidable tragedy. The Wyatts never tried to justify it, and would not hire lawyers to justify it. It could not be justified.\nIt went like this: In the nineteen twenties the United States Navy awarded Wyatt Clock a contract to produce several thousand standardized ships\u2019 clocks that could be easily read in the dark. The dials were to be black. The hands and the numerals were to be hand-painted with white paint containing the radioactive element radium. About half a hundred Brockton women, most of them relatives of regular Wyatt Clock Company employees, were hired to paint the hands and numerals. It was a way to make pin money. Several of the women who had young children to look after were allowed to do the work at home.\nNow all those women had died or were about to die most horribly with their bones crumbling, with their heads rotting off. The cause was radium poisoning. Every one of them had been told by a foreman, it had since come out in court, that she should keep a fine point on her brush by moistening it and shaping it with her lips from time to time.\nAnd, as luck would have it, the daughter of one of those unfortunate women would become one of the four women I have ever loved in this Vale of Tears\u2014along with my mother, my wife, and Sarah Wyatt. Mary Kathleen O\u2019Looney was her name.\n10\nI SPEAK ONLY OF RUTH as \u201cmy wife.\u201d It would not surprise me, though, if on Judgment Day Sarah Wyatt and Mary Kathleen O\u2019Looney were also certified as having been wives of mine. I surely paired off with both of them\u2014with Mary Kathleen for about eleven months, and with Sarah, off and on, to be sure, for about seven years.\nI can hear Saint Peter saying to me: \u201cIt would appear, Mr. Starbuck, that you were something of a Don Juan.\u201d\nSo there I was in Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-one, sashaying into the wedding-cake lobby of the Hotel Arapahoe with beautiful Sarah Wyatt, the Yankee clock heiress, on my arm. Her family was nearly as broke as mine by then. What little they had salvaged would soon be dispersed among the survivors of the women who painted all those clocks for the Navy. This dispersal would be compelled in about a year by a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court as to the personal responsibility of employers for deaths in their places of work caused by criminal negligence.\nEighteen-year-old Sarah now said of the Arapahoe lobby, \u201cIt\u2019s so dirty\u2014and there\u2019s nobody here.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI love it,\u201d she said.\nAt that point in time, in the filthy lobby of the Arapahoe, Sarah Wyatt did not know that I was acting with all possible humorlessness on orders from Alexander Hamilton McCone.

I wasn\u2019t being impudent. I was abject.\n\u201cOn the same day Kimberley heard you talk about Yen and fellatio, before classes had even begun,\u201d he said, \u201ca senior led her and the other freshmen to the library and solemnly told them that the bell clappers on the wall were petrified penises. That was surely barracks humor the senior had picked up from you.\u201d\nFor once I didn\u2019t have to defend myself. Several of the Trustees assured Wilder that telling freshmen that the clappers were penises was a tradition that antedated my arrival on campus by at least 20 years.\nBut that was the only time they defended me, although 1 of them had been my student, Madelaine Astor, nee Peabody, and 5 of them were parents of those I had taught. Madelaine dictated a letter to me afterward, explaining that Jason Wilder had promised to denounce the college in his column and on his TV show if the Trustees did not fire me.\nSo they dared not come to my assistance.\nSHE SAID, TOO, that since she, like Wilder, was a Roman Catholic, she was shocked to hear me say on tape that Hitler was a Roman Catholic, and that the Nazis painted crosses on their tanks and airplanes because they considered themselves a Christian army. Wilder had played that tape right after I had been cleared of all responsibility for freshmen\u2019s being told that the clappers were penises.\nOnce again I was in deep trouble for merely repeating what somebody else had said. It wasn\u2019t something my grandfather had said this time, or somebody else who couldn\u2019t be hurt by the Trustees, like Paul Slazinger. It was something my best friend Damon Stern had said in a History class only a couple of months before.\nIf Jason Wilder thought I was an unteacher, he should have heard Damon Stern! Then again, Stern never told the awful truth about supposedly noble human actions in recent times.

here.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Cady is absolutely right,\u201d said Upton Beaton. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensible, sturdy truck, with many years of dependable service ahead of it. We were foolish to think of putting the fire district into debt for the next twenty years, just for an expensive plaything for the fire department. Mr. Cady has cut right to the heart of the matter.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same sort of thing I\u2019ve been fighting in industry for half my life,\u201d said Cady. \u201cMen falling in love with show instead of the job to be done.

During the intervening twenty-one days, Hal Brayton, the grocer, had stopped adding bills on paper sacks and bought an adding machine, and had moved his counters around so as to transform his customer space from a jammed box canyon into a racetrack. Mrs. Dickie, the postmistress, had moved her leafy children and their table out of her cage and had had the lowest tier of mailboxes raised to eye level. The fire department had voted down scarlet and blue capes for the band as unnecessary for firefighting. And startling figures had been produced in a school meeting proving beyond any doubt that it would cost seven dollars, twenty-nine cents, and six mills more per student per year to maintain the Spruce Falls Grade School than it would to ship the children to the big, efficient, centralized school in Ilium.\nThe whole populace looked as though it had received a powerful stimulant. People walked and drove faster, concluded business more quickly, and every eye seemed wider and brighter\u2014even frenzied. And moving proudly through this brave new world were the two men who were shaping it, constant companions after working hours now. Newell Cady and Upton Beaton. Beaton\u2019s function was to provide Cady with the facts and figures behind village activities and then to endorse outrageously Cady\u2019s realistic suggestions for reforms, which followed facts and figures as the night the day.", 0.11627293341579058], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["hamburger", 0.03125], ["looked", 0.03125], ["atmosphere", 0.020833333333333332], ["apple", 0.020833333333333332], ["burger", 0.020833333333333332], ["cries", 0.020833333333333332], ["earth", 0.020833333333333332], ["macdonald", 0.020833333333333332], ["animal", 0.020833333333333332], ["trout", 0.020833333333333332], ["science", 0.020833333333333332], ["cry", 0.010416666666666666], ["chains", 0.010416666666666666], ["lay", 0.010416666666666666], ["skin", 0.010416666666666666], ["finished", 0.010416666666666666], ["mistaken", 0.010416666666666666], ["highly", 0.010416666666666666], ["relative", 0.010416666666666666], ["hoover", 0.010416666666666666], ["pieces", 0.010416666666666666], ["wasn", 0.010416666666666666], ["thick", 0.010416666666666666], ["dwayne", 0.010416666666666666], ["ground", 0.010416666666666666], ["perfect", 0.010416666666666666], ["planet", 0.010416666666666666], ["outer", 0.010416666666666666], ["patties", 0.010416666666666666], ["coal", 0.010416666666666666], ["chefs", 0.010416666666666666], ["west", 0.010416666666666666], ["travel", 0.010416666666666666], ["establishments", 0.010416666666666666], ["fiction", 0.010416666666666666], ["owned", 0.010416666666666666], ["rotten", 0.010416666666666666], ["writers", 0.010416666666666666], ["shaped", 0.010416666666666666], ["details", 0.010416666666666666], ["heartrending", 0.010416666666666666], ["technical", 0.010416666666666666], ["bread", 0.010416666666666666], ["bored", 0.010416666666666666], ["establishment", 0.010416666666666666], ["franchises", 0.010416666666666666], ["killed", 0.010416666666666666], ["sound", 0.010416666666666666], ["product", 0.010416666666666666], ["mixture", 0.010416666666666666], ["bits", 0.010416666666666666], ["big", 0.010416666666666666], ["eater", 0.010416666666666666], ["knew", 0.010416666666666666], ["driver", 0.010416666666666666], ["virginia", 0.010416666666666666], ["trees", 0.010416666666666666], ["whistle", 0.010416666666666666], ["heat", 0.010416666666666666], ["fruit", 0.010416666666666666], ["compressed", 0.010416666666666666], ["vacuum", 0.010416666666666666], ["flowers", 0.010416666666666666], ["fled", 0.010416666666666666], ["destruction", 0.010416666666666666], ["bushes", 0.010416666666666666], ["chef", 0.010416666666666666], ["fried", 0.010416666666666666], ["stiff", 0.010416666666666666], ["excrement", 0.010416666666666666], ["grasses", 0.010416666666666666], ["space", 0.010416666666666666], ["reason", 0.010416666666666666], ["thought", 0.010416666666666666], ["dinosaur", 0.010416666666666666], ["supposed", 0.010416666666666666], ["popular", 0.010416666666666666], ["whistles", 0.010416666666666666], ["kilgore", 0.010416666666666666], ["country", 0.010416666666666666], ["pulled", 0.010416666666666666], ["steam", 0.010416666666666666], ["songs", 0.010416666666666666]], "sentiment": ["Coal was a highly compressed mixture of rotten trees and flowers and bushes and grasses and so on, and dinosaur excrement.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nKilgore Trout thought about the cries of steam whistles he had known, and about the destruction of West Virginia, which made their songs possible.
