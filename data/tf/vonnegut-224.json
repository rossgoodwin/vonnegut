It would still run\u2014but limpingly, at only about sixty-eight thousand miles an hour. It was adequate for short hops around the Solar System, even in its crippled condition, and copies of the crippled ship did yeoman service for the Martian war effort. But the crippled ship was impossibly slow for the purposes of Salo\u2019s intergalactic errand.\nSo old Salo holed up on Titan and he sent home to Tralfamadore word of his plight. He sent the message home with the speed of light, which meant that it would take one hundred and fifty thousand Earthling years to get to Tralfamadore.\nHe developed several hobbies that helped him to pass the time. Chief among these were sculpture, the breeding of Titanic daisies, and watching the various activities on Earth. He could watch the activities on Earth by means of a viewer on the dash panel of his ship. The viewer was sufficiently powerful to let Salo follow the activities of Earthling ants, if he so wished.\nIt was through this viewer that he got his first reply from Tralfamadore. The reply was written on Earth in huge stones on a plain in what is now England. The ruins of the reply still stand, and are known as Stonehenge. The meaning of Stonehenge in Tralfamadorian, when viewed from above, is: \"Replacement part being rushed with all possible speed.\"\nStonehenge wasn\u2019t the only message old Salo had received.\nThere had been four others, all of them written on Earth.\nThe Great Wall of China means in Tralfamadorian, when viewed from above: \"Be patient. We haven\u2019t forgotten about you.\"\nThe Golden House of the Roman Emperor Nero meant: \"We are doing the best we can.\"\nThe meaning of the Moscow Kremlin when it was first walled was: \"You will be on your way before you know it. \"\nThe meaning of the Palace of the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, is: \"Pack up your things and be ready to leave on short notice.\"", 0.14880952380952384], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["papa", 0.0449438202247191], ["cylinder", 0.02247191011235955], ["bokonon", 0.02247191011235955], ["contained", 0.02247191011235955], ["walls", 0.02247191011235955], ["dinghy", 0.02247191011235955], ["lifeboat", 0.02247191011235955], ["belly", 0.02247191011235955], ["bed", 0.02247191011235955], ["control", 0.011235955056179775], ["golden", 0.011235955056179775], ["sail", 0.011235955056179775], ["san", 0.011235955056179775], ["chain", 0.011235955056179775], ["brought", 0.011235955056179775], ["wall", 0.011235955056179775], ["stripped", 0.011235955056179775], ["von", 0.011235955056179775], ["head", 0.011235955056179775], ["mistaken", 0.011235955056179775], ["slipper", 0.011235955056179775], ["luffing", 0.011235955056179775], ["bright", 0.011235955056179775], ["kill", 0.011235955056179775], ["promised", 0.011235955056179775], ["grateful", 0.011235955056179775], ["pain", 0.011235955056179775], ["ship", 0.011235955056179775], ["teeth", 0.011235955056179775], ["size", 0.011235955056179775], ["corporal", 0.011235955056179775], ["ice", 0.011235955056179775], ["glistening", 0.011235955056179775], ["tire", 0.011235955056179775], ["chattered", 0.011235955056179775], ["angry", 0.011235955056179775], ["long", 0.011235955056179775], ["bent", 0.011235955056179775], ["hot", 0.011235955056179775], ["lorenzo", 0.011235955056179775], ["97", 0.011235955056179775], ["radiated", 0.011235955056179775], ["monzano", 0.011235955056179775], ["white", 0.011235955056179775], ["speak", 0.011235955056179775], ["knotted", 0.011235955056179775], ["merciless", 0.011235955056179775], ["schooner", 0.011235955056179775], ["shivered", 0.011235955056179775], ["breathing", 0.011235955056179775], ["christian", 0.011235955056179775], ["cartridge", 0.011235955056179775], ["frank", 0.011235955056179775], ["splinter", 0.011235955056179775], ["charm", 0.011235955056179775], ["pendant", 0.011235955056179775], ["rifle", 0.011235955056179775], ["gilt", 0.011235955056179775], ["tiller", 0.011235955056179775], ["careful", 0.011235955056179775], ["lady", 0.011235955056179775], ["agonized", 0.011235955056179775], ["painter", 0.011235955056179775], ["waist", 0.011235955056179775], ["ago", 0.011235955056179775], ["stinking", 0.011235955056179775], ["magic", 0.011235955056179775], ["room", 0.011235955056179775], ["disease", 0.011235955056179775], ["bow", 0.011235955056179775], ["mccabe", 0.011235955056179775], ["red", 0.011235955056179775], ["oarlocks", 0.011235955056179775], ["supposed", 0.011235955056179775], ["hung", 0.011235955056179775], ["bathed", 0.011235955056179775], ["neck", 0.011235955056179775], ["koenigswald", 0.011235955056179775]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWe\u2019ll be careful not to tire him,\u201d Frank promised.\n\u201cIf you could kill him,\u201d said Von Koenigswald, \u201cI think he\u2019d be grateful.\u201d\n97\nTHE STINKING CHRISTIAN\n\u201cPAPA\u201d MONZANO and his merciless disease were in a bed that was made of a golden dinghy\u2014tiller, painter, oarlocks and all, all gilt.

soberly to the thick tree trunk. He turned and looked down at his hands thoughtfully. His first words were so soft, so choked with emotion, that few heard them. He inhaled deeply, threw back his shoulders, raised his eyes, and gathered strength to say them again.\nIn the brief moment before Kroner spoke again, Paul looked about himself. His eyes met those of Shepherd and Berringer, and what passed between them was tender and sweet. The crowd had miraculously become a sort of homogenized pudding. It was impossible to tell where one ego left off and the next began.\n\u201cIt is our custom,\u201d said Kroner; \u201cit is the custom here at the Meadows\u2014our custom, our Meadows\u2014to meet here under our tree, our symbol of strong roots, trunk, and branches, our symbol of courage, integrity, perseverance, beauty. It is our custom to meet here to remember our departed friends and co-workers.\u201d\nAnd now he forgot the crowd, and talked to the fat cumulus clouds scudding over the blue sky. \u201cSince last we met, Doctor Ernest S.

He was my friend; he was our friend: a great American, a great engineer, a great manager, a great pioneer at the head of the procession of civilization, opening new, undreamed-of doors to better things, for better living, for more people, at less cost.\u201d\nNow and then brokenly, Kroner told of Ernie Bassett as a young engineer, and he traced his career from works to works.\n\u201cHe gave himself unstintingly engineeringwise, managershipwise, personalitywise, Americanwise, and\u2014\u201d Kroner paused to look impressively from face to face. Again he talked to the clouds\u2014\u201cheartwise.\u201d\nA man stepped from the crowd to hand Kroner a long white box. Kroner opened it slowly and studied it thoughtfully before showing its contents to anyone else.

He had never borrowed anything from me, but now my turn had come. He told me of a family emergency, and asked for a sum that was just about the size of the little grubstake I had built. I ran into him about five years later, and he told me that he scarcely thought of anything but the day when he could pay me back with interest.\nAnd people reached me by mail, most often asking me to read this or that new novel and write some words of praise for the jacket.\nNo book had been published in the past ten years for which I had not written a blurb.\nBut then an old friend wrote a book so bad that even I, crossing my eyes and ransacking it from end to end, could find nothing in it which could be mistaken for even a winsome sort of imbecility. So I declined to write a blurb. This may have been a major turning point in my life.\nIt was a crisis in the life of another writer, too, it turned out. He had written a blurb for the book I had spurned. He called me up in the middle of the night, long distance and sounding as though he had just swallowed Drano. \u201cMy God,\u201d he said, \u201cyou just can\u2019t leave me on that book jacket all alone.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd so on. Somewhere in there my son Mark went crazy and recovered. I went out to Vancouver and saw how sick he was, and I put him in a nut house. I had to suppose that he might never get well again.\nHe never blamed me or his mother, as I have said before. His generous wish not to blame us was so stubborn that he became almost a crank on the subject of chemical and genetic causes of mental illness. Talk therapy made sense as poetry but not as a means to a cure, he thought.\nBut now, as a physician, as an open-minded scientist, he has delivered himself into the hands of a talk therapist, blabbing his head off about Jane and me and his sisters and his cousins and all that, I hope, and finding it hilariously beneficial.", -0.03181277056277056], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["ben", 0.08], ["twelve", 0.05333333333333334], ["rose", 0.05333333333333334], ["heh", 0.04], ["kilraine", 0.04], ["dollars", 0.04], ["thing", 0.02666666666666667], ["fortune", 0.02666666666666667], ["comment", 0.013333333333333334], ["spaced", 0.013333333333333334], ["people", 0.013333333333333334], ["feel", 0.013333333333333334], ["spooky", 0.013333333333333334], ["hehs", 0.013333333333333334], ["hard", 0.013333333333333334], ["sleepy", 0.013333333333333334], ["tonight", 0.013333333333333334], ["bring", 0.013333333333333334], ["rusty", 0.013333333333333334], ["full", 0.013333333333333334], ["sleep", 0.013333333333333334], ["sense", 0.013333333333333334], ["bones", 0.013333333333333334], ["conversation", 0.013333333333333334], ["creep", 0.013333333333333334], ["speak", 0.013333333333333334], ["rattlingly", 0.013333333333333334], ["funny", 0.013333333333333334], ["rude", 0.013333333333333334], ["began", 0.013333333333333334], ["percent", 0.013333333333333334], ["three", 0.013333333333333334], ["house", 0.013333333333333334], ["drink", 0.013333333333333334], ["breathing", 0.013333333333333334], ["advantage", 0.013333333333333334], ["nod", 0.013333333333333334], ["big", 0.013333333333333334], ["felt", 0.013333333333333334], ["inhaled", 0.013333333333333334], ["polite", 0.013333333333333334], ["hinges", 0.013333333333333334], ["squawked", 0.013333333333333334], ["awe", 0.013333333333333334], ["fate", 0.013333333333333334], ["phantasm", 0.013333333333333334], ["day", 0.013333333333333334], ["exhaled", 0.013333333333333334], ["apart", 0.013333333333333334], ["third", 0.013333333333333334], ["joel", 0.013333333333333334], ["sarcasm", 0.013333333333333334], ["person", 0.013333333333333334], ["wrench", 0.013333333333333334], ["shade", 0.013333333333333334], ["nervous", 0.013333333333333334]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever feel anything again,\u201d said Rose. \u201cNothing means anything anymore.

your being so far away is that we see so little of you, and we need you a lot.\nThe second worst thing is that you see so little of us, so that we cease to be our actual selves to you and become creatures of your imagination.\nI admire fiction, am amused and excited by the oversimplification of life it represents. I don\u2019t want to become a character in fiction myself, however, and I want to get along very well with you. So you can do me an enormous favor by thinking of me as a person afloat in time, as you are, rather than as a character locked into the machinery of a fiction plot, with villains and temptresses and so on. The hell of it is that it is so easy to turn anybody\u2019s life into some kind of story we have heard before. If I have money now, which I do, it is almost inevitable for people who don\u2019t know me to project me into a cliched tale about how the rich behave. I vanish, and the story lives on. I am a rich guy who abandons his wife to go to the big city and live in a town house and ride around in a Mercedes and live with the Wicked Witch of the East.\nThe Mercedes is so self-indulgent and ridiculous that I myself confess to being aghast. It is sort of like Mark\u2019s sailboat, I guess. But the townhouse is after all simply a house in New York, where I live. If I die, you and Mark and Edith will inherit it, along with a large mortgage. I had the option of putting money into stocks, which continue to go down, down, down, or leaving it as cash, which also becomes more worthless every day. I guessed that real estate would probably increase in value, and that I could at any rate inhabit it, whether its value went up or down. Jill rents the bottom floor for $400 a month. She paid for the wallpaper and the bed and some other stuff, and pays her share of the groceries.\nAs for Jill herself: I would be startled if you did not have deep misgivings about her, and if you did not imagine that she disliked you. As one more floater in time, she is as jumpy as you are, and is in fact prepared to love you a great deal. I don\u2019t require that you like her, and perhaps you never will. It would help a lot, though, if you would understand that she has been very good to me during the most shattering years of my life, and that she was not the one who did the shattering. Jane didn\u2019t do the shattering, either, and neither did money or success. The entirety of life did the shattering. And everything began to come to pieces for me long before I met Jill or had money and fame. I went to Iowa all by myself, remember? Nobody knew who I was. I was lucky to get the job. I was also lucky to get away from the perpetual emergencies at home, and my personal loneliness there, and to talk to artists for a change, and to do something I hadn\u2019t had time to do since I was your age, which was to ponder who I was and what I might do with my life. No woman lured me there. I didn\u2019t know any woman there. No woman ever lured me anywhere. It\u2019s the arts and artists who are my tempters and temptresses. If there is to be a Judgment Day, it will come out then that I have been one of the most laggardly adulterers of my time.
