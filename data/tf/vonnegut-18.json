dispatch, telling of your \u201cinflammatory\u201d editorial policy, and of the ultimatum with which you have been presented for your failure to \u201creflect the thinking of the people in the community.\u201d\nI gather that you intend to reject the ultimatum and give local reaction a first-rate fight. Like thousands of others who have seen the same story, I find your vigorous struggle exciting, inspiring, and absolutely crucial. Through your front page ballots you demonstrated that you are endorsed by an overwhelming majority of your readers; your opposition seeks to demonstrate that a wealthy minority can coerce the press whenever it wishes to do so, without regard to the community\u2019s will. Your predicament is one of a thousand faced by progressive editors all over America. Such editors usually lose. To speak in terms of humanity, in terms of change engendered by compassion and yearning for a better life on earth for the human species, is to incur the fury of those fortunate few who are wonderfully well off in Valley Cities over the face of creation under the system as it now stands.\nThat is not to say that those who plan to put the Times-Record out of business are evil. Presumably among those citizens of Valley City who now favor pro-labor attitudes, who back cooperatives and other institutions which give low income individuals a measure of security in a basically insecure dog-eat-dog economy, there will be a few who will come to be rich. They will then find such collective movements detrimental to their incomes, and will strive to thwart them. What must be realized is that the main trouble with free enterprise, with rugged individualism which gives every man the right to make as wide a margin of profit as he has the wit to wheedle, is that there is simply not enough wealth to go around. If there is to be no ceiling on the amount of money a man can take out of our economy, then concomitantly there can be no firm foundation below which a human being cannot sink. What capitalists must realize is that you are fighting to make capitalism survive, not to destroy it; you are fighting to eliminate the seeds of destruction inherent in the status quo. Thank heaven for your struggle to give succor to that proportion of our society which must remain in moderate circumstances \u2026\nSeptember 1, 1947\n[Chicago]\nTO HELEN AND WALTER A.

Yesterday, November 11th of that year, I turned seventy-four. Seventy-four!\nJohannes Brahms quit composing symphonies when he was fifty-five. Enough! My architect father was sick and tired of architecture when he was fifty-five. Enough! American male novelists have done their best work by then. Enough! Fifty-five is a long time ago for me now. Have pity!\nMy great big fish, which stunk so, was entitled Timequake. Let us think of it as Timequake One. And let us think of this one, a stew made from its best parts mixed with thoughts and experiences during the past seven months or so, as Timequake Two.\nHokay?\nThe premise of Timequake One was that a timequake, a sudden glitch in the space-time continuum, made everybody and everything do exactly what they\u2019d done during a past decade, for good or ill, a second time. It was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that wouldn\u2019t quit for ten long years. You couldn\u2019t complain about life\u2019s being nothing but old stuff, or ask if just you were going nuts or if everybody was going nuts.\nThere was absolutely nothing you could say during the rerun, if you hadn\u2019t said it the first time through the decade. You couldn\u2019t even save your own life or that of a loved one, if you had failed to do that the first time through.\nI had the timequake zap everybody and everything in an instant from February 13th, 2001, back to February 17th, 1991. Then we all had to get back to 2001 the hard way, minute by minute, hour by hour, year by year, betting on the wrong horse again, marrying the wrong person again, getting the clap again. You name it!\nOnly when people got back to when the timequake hit did they stop being robots of their pasts. As the old science fiction writer Kilgore Trout said, \u201cOnly when free will kicked in again could they stop running obstacle courses of their own construction.\u201d\nTrout doesn\u2019t really exist. He has been my alter ego in several of my other novels. But most of what I have chosen to preserve from Timequake One has to do with his adventures and opinions. I have salvaged a few of the thousands of stories he wrote between 1931, when he was fourteen, and 2001, when he died at the age of eighty-four. A hobo for much of his life, he died in luxury in the Ernest Hemingway Suite of the writers\u2019 retreat Xanadu in the summer resort village of Point Zion, Rhode Island. That\u2019s nice to know.\nHis very first story, he told me as he was dying, was set in Camelot, the court of King Arthur in Britain: Merlin the Court Magician casts a spell that allows him to equip the Knights of the Round Table with Thompson submachine guns and drums of .45-caliber dumdums.", 0.07831465919701212], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["george", 0.043478260869565216], ["ten", 0.028985507246376812], ["diana", 0.028985507246376812], ["kissed", 0.028985507246376812], ["long", 0.028985507246376812], ["moon", 0.028985507246376812], ["beer", 0.028985507246376812], ["hazel", 0.028985507246376812], ["television", 0.028985507246376812], ["glampers", 0.028985507246376812], ["comment", 0.014492753623188406], ["love", 0.014492753623188406], ["fired", 0.014492753623188406], ["remained", 0.014492753623188406], ["turned", 0.014492753623188406], ["dead", 0.014492753623188406], ["general", 0.014492753623188406], ["empress", 0.014492753623188406], ["gauge", 0.014492753623188406], ["aimed", 0.014492753623188406], ["suspended", 0.014492753623188406], ["loaded", 0.014492753623188406], ["forget", 0.014492753623188406], ["barreled", 0.014492753623188406], ["floor", 0.014492753623188406], ["burned", 0.014492753623188406], ["tube", 0.014492753623188406], ["yup", 0.014492753623188406], ["neutralizing", 0.014492753623188406], ["gravity", 0.014492753623188406], ["handicap", 0.014492753623188406], ["pure", 0.014492753623188406], ["handicaps", 0.014492753623188406], ["sat", 0.014492753623188406], ["told", 0.014492753623188406], ["real", 0.014492753623188406], ["ceiling", 0.014492753623188406], ["shotgun", 0.014492753623188406], ["hit", 0.014492753623188406], ["crying", 0.014492753623188406], ["inches", 0.014492753623188406], ["seconds", 0.014492753623188406], ["studio", 0.014492753623188406], ["sad", 0.014492753623188406], ["bergerons", 0.014492753623188406], ["kitchen", 0.014492753623188406], ["paused", 0.014492753623188406], ["handicapper", 0.014492753623188406], ["double", 0.014492753623188406], ["signal", 0.014492753623188406], ["gun", 0.014492753623188406], ["air", 0.014492753623188406], ["will", 0.014492753623188406], ["musicians", 0.014492753623188406], ["time", 0.014492753623188406], ["shook", 0.014492753623188406], ["emperor", 0.014492753623188406], ["blackout", 0.014492753623188406]], "sentiment": ["They kissed it.\nAnd then, neutralizing gravity with love and pure will, they remained suspended in air inches below the ceiling, and they kissed each other for a long, long time.\nIt was then that Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, came into the studio with a double-barreled ten-gauge shotgun.

They were in one hell of a lot of trouble. They weren\u2019t expected at the picnic. They weren\u2019t even supposed to be in the United States. Thirty-six hours before, they had been stokers aboard an Italian freighter which was taking on cargo in Newport News, Virginia. They had jumped ship in order to escape military conscription at home, and because the streets of America were paved with gold. They spoke no English.\nOther Italians in Newport News boosted them and their cardboard suitcases into an empty boxcar in a train that was bound for God-knows-where. The train began to move immediately. The sun went down. There were no stars, no moon that night. America was blackness and clackety-clack.\nHow do I know what the night was like? Gino and Marco Maritimo, as old men, both told me so.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSomewhere in the seamless darkness, which may have been West Virginia, Gino and Marco were joined by four American hoboes, who at knife-point took their suitcases, their coats, their hats, and their shoes.\nThey were lucky they didn\u2019t have their throats slit for fun. Who would have cared?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHow they wished that their peepholes would close! But the nightmare went on and on. And then it became a daymare. The train stopped several times, but in the midst of such ugliness that Gino and Marco could not bring themselves to step out into it, to somehow start living there. But then two railroad detectives with long clubs made them get out anyway, and, like it or lump it, they were on the outskirts of Midland City, Ohio, on the other side of Sugar Creek from the center of town.\nThey were terribly hungry and thirsty. They could either await death, or they could invent something to do. They invented. They saw a conical slate roof on the other side of the river, and they walked toward that.

James Earl Ray died of liver failure on April 23 of 1998. According to Saint Peter, though, he has so far been unwilling to take a single step into the Life Everlasting awaiting him beyond the Pearly Gates.\nHe\u2019s no moron: he has an IQ of 108, well above average when measured against the intelligence of the general American population. He said to me that he wasn\u2019t going to set foot into eternity until a prison cell was built for him. He said the only way he could feel cozy forever was in a prison cell. In a cell, he said, he wouldn\u2019t give a darn how much time was passing by. Actually, he used the \u201cs\u201d word, wouldn\u2019t give a good \u201cshit\u201d how much time was passing by.\nHis conversation is still liberally spinkled with the \u201cn\u201d word for African Americans, despite Saint Peter\u2019s pleas that he, for the love God, pipe the hell down. He said he never would have shot \u201cthe big n,\u201d meaning Dr. King, if he\u2019d known the bullet would make what \u201cthe big n\u201d said and fought for so effing famous all over the effing world. \u201cBecause of me,\u201d he said, \u201clittle white children are being taught that \u2018the big n\u2019 was some kind of American hero, like George effing Washington. Because of my little old bullet,\u201d he said, \u201cthe shit \u2018the big n\u2019 said has been carved into marble monuments and inlaid with effing gold, I hear.\u201d\nThis is Kurt Vonnegut in the effing state-of-the-art lethal injection facility in Huntsville, effing, Texas signing off.\nduring my most recent controlled\nnear-death experience, I got to interview William Shakespeare. We did not hit it off. He said the dialect I spoke was the ugliest English he had ever heard, \u201cfit to split the ears of groundlings.\u201d He asked if it had a name, and I said, \u201cIndianapolis.\u201d\nI congratulated him on all the Oscars the movie Shakespeare in Love had won, since it had his play Romeo and Juliet as its centerpiece.\nHe said of the Oscars, and of the movie itself, \u201cA tale told

What does he do with his money?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as we know, he\u2019s a bachelor, but he keeps that house cleaner than a woman would. The General thinks he\u2019s got his money hidden in the house somewhere, because he never goes anywhere where he could spend it. We do all his shopping for him, and he never buys anything but food and tobacco and padlocks,\u201d Hope explained matter-of-factly. \u201cThat\u2019s the really funny thing about him\u2014the locks. If you make a trip into town, chances are he\u2019ll ask you to get him one. He\u2019s got padlocks all over that house. There were four on his front door the last time I counted.\u201d\nThe General called from below, \u201cLunch time!\u201d To Haley the announcement was incredible. At 9 a.m., after watching four rural hours inch by, he had concluded that the clocks of Ardennes Farm were lubricated with molasses, and that noon was still a century away in terms of time as he had known it in the city.\nNoon brought with it the solid blessings of strong coffee and whole milk, of strawberry jam and biscuits, of ham and gravy. It was an hour of peace and plenty, reminding Haley of a medieval custom he had read about\u2014whereby a condemned man was hanged and skillfully revived several times before being permitted to expire completely. The analogy did not spoil his appetite. He wolfed his food, excused himself, and lay down on the sunroom couch.\nBits of conversation from the kitchen infiltrated his consciousness. He stored them away, too weary to think much about them. Kitty, who, Annie had said, had slept until 11, was defending her relationship with Roy Flemming, her beau of the night before. She seemed agitated, punctuating her replies to the General\u2019s poignant assaults on Roy\u2019s character with nose blowing. She declared that she loved Roy, and that this was one romance her father was not going to break up. There seemed to have been plenty of cases where the General had succeeded in doing just that.\n\u201cUntil you\u2019re twenty-one, young lady, let me be the judge of who your associates should be,\u201d Haley heard the General say. \u201cAfter that, you\u2019re free to marry anybody, simply anybody\u2014Flemming, Mr. Banghart, or the next bum who stops for a handout. Until that happy day, however, I am very much in charge. Do we understand each other?\u201d Kitty hastened past Haley\u2019s aching form and hurried up the stairs to slam her bedroom door on a loveless world for lovers.\n\u201cH-hour!\u201d shouted the General, and he harangued his flagging troops into the field once more.\nIn an eon came evening, to cool and to displace the sounds of daytime with whispers and croaks and sounds like rusty hinges from grass-tuft sanctuaries in woods and pastures and from lily pads a quarter of a mile away.\nAnnie had prepared supper an hour ago, and, from the small window at the end of a long corridor between bales in the loft, Haley could see her putting it into the oven to keep it warm. He, Hope, and Mr. Banghart, meeting a quota set by the General, were stacking the last wagonload in the barn. The General had returned to the house, leaving the three of them to handle what remained without his supervision. It was much cooler now, and, with him gone, an element of playfulness came into the business of lugging bales. Haley found his burdens miraculously lightened. Mr. Banghart sang a medley of rhythmic spirituals, setting a tempo by which they tugged and lifted. The work was done.\nThey sat down in the corridor between bales to get their breaths and to shake the dust and straw-bits from their hair. As bad as his first taste of rural life had been, Haley found himself looking with pride at the results of their labor, stacked bales rising like skyscrapers on either side of them. Mr. Banghart sat still for only a minute, arising again to feel along the upper surface of a rafter until he found what he wanted, a flashlight. \u201cWe can show Haley our secret, can\u2019t we,

"sentiment": ["Fear and Conscience struggled for mastery of his feet. Conscience gained an almost imperceptible advantage, and Haley found himself returning slowly to the tunnel. In his hand was a claw hammer he had found by the ladder.\nHis rescue mission was frustrated, his honor unredeemed. He was met in the corridor by Hope, who was massaging her right arm, and by Mr. Banghart, whose knife was sheathed and tucked beneath his belt.\n\u201cWhat on earth got into you, all of a sudden?\u201d asked Mr. Banghart solicitously.\n\u201cI tripped and fell in the dark,\u201d said Haley quickly. He turned to Hope, and prayed that his lie would make him whole again in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hope; I didn\u2019t mean to fall against you.\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be helped, I guess. Don\u2019t worry about it \u2014 just a bruise.\u201d\nHaley sighed gratefully. They descended the ladder, and walked from the barn together. Mr. Banghart struck out for his own house, and Haley and Hope mounted the back steps to the kitchen. Just before she pushed open the screen door, Hope turned to Haley, who was congratulating himself on having talked his way out of a perfectly desolate situation.\n\u201cIf you flop as a piano player, you can always make a good living as a bodyguard,\u201d she said.\nIV.\n\u201cNow take the case of the 240 howitzer,\u201d said the General. \u201cFar more effective against concrete bunkers than aerial bombardment. I remember just before the Bulge, the glamour boys dropped everything they had on a Jerry pillbox, and didn\u2019t even chip it. So I called back to First Army Headquarters. \u2018Send up some 240s,\u2019 I said. Well sir\u2026\u201d\nHaley nodded, and turned his face toward the sunroom windows to hide his yawn from the General. Nothing moved in his line of sight save Mr. Banghart, who bobbed in the distance on the springing seat of a moving machine, circling again and again a shrinking island of standing alfalfa. It was Saturday afternoon; an afternoon, as the bulletin board decreed, for \u201crecreation and cleanup.\u201d Haley had tuned in a concert broadcast on the sunroom\u2019s small radio, but when the General had started to shout war stories above the music, Annie had turned it off. From overhead came a muffled scuffing, Kitty and Hope moving about their rooms, tidying them up. Annie sat in a rocker near Haley, attentive to the General\u2019s words, and seemingly very entertained.", 0.12987213403880069], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["will", 0.05042016806722689], ["boston", 0.03361344537815126], ["clocks", 0.025210084033613446], ["philadelphia", 0.025210084033613446], ["supposed", 0.025210084033613446], ["plane", 0.025210084033613446], ["sleep", 0.01680672268907563], ["pass", 0.01680672268907563], ["wrote", 0.01680672268907563], ["night", 0.01680672268907563], ["hare", 0.01680672268907563], ["twitch", 0.01680672268907563], ["berlin", 0.01680672268907563], ["lufthansa", 0.01680672268907563], ["frankfurt", 0.01680672268907563], ["wind", 0.01680672268907563], ["dance", 0.008403361344537815], ["dollar", 0.008403361344537815], ["fear", 0.008403361344537815], ["slow", 0.008403361344537815], ["grotesque", 0.008403361344537815], ["going", 0.008403361344537815], ["east", 0.008403361344537815], ["meant", 0.008403361344537815], ["good", 0.008403361344537815], ["fate", 0.008403361344537815], ["read", 0.008403361344537815], ["calendars", 0.008403361344537815], ["flew", 0.008403361344537815], ["bar", 0.008403361344537815], ["backgrounds", 0.008403361344537815], ["baroque", 0.008403361344537815], ["vision", 0.008403361344537815], ["brave", 0.008403361344537815], ["art", 0.008403361344537815], ["leningrad", 0.008403361344537815], ["people", 0.008403361344537815], ["waking", 0.008403361344537815], ["second", 0.008403361344537815], ["books", 0.008403361344537815], ["erika", 0.008403361344537815], ["motel", 0.008403361344537815], ["daytime", 0.008403361344537815], ["fog", 0.008403361344537815], ["dresden", 0.008403361344537815], ["french", 0.008403361344537815], ["death", 0.008403361344537815], ["accident", 0.008403361344537815], ["couldn", 0.008403361344537815], ["persons", 0.008403361344537815], ["soldier", 0.008403361344537815], ["socked", 0.008403361344537815], ["ostrovsky", 0.008403361344537815], ["feel", 0.008403361344537815], ["roethke", 0.008403361344537815], ["west", 0.008403361344537815], ["lot", 0.008403361344537815], ["limousine", 0.008403361344537815], ["war", 0.008403361344537815], ["friend", 0.008403361344537815], ["vienna", 0.008403361344537815], ["head", 0.008403361344537815], ["wake", 0.008403361344537815], ["hamburg", 0.008403361344537815], ["russian", 0.008403361344537815], ["fly", 0.008403361344537815], ["kind", 0.008403361344537815], ["skull", 0.008403361344537815], ["salzburg", 0.008403361344537815], ["earthling", 0.008403361344537815], ["straight", 0.008403361344537815], ["stories", 0.008403361344537815], ["learn", 0.008403361344537815], ["kissing", 0.008403361344537815], ["cracked", 0.008403361344537815], ["treated", 0.008403361344537815], ["year", 0.008403361344537815], ["laughs", 0.008403361344537815], ["doctor", 0.008403361344537815], ["write", 0.008403361344537815], ["book", 0.008403361344537815], ["poor", 0.008403361344537815], ["electric", 0.008403361344537815], ["novels", 0.008403361344537815], ["theodore", 0.008403361344537815], ["watch", 0.008403361344537815], ["hand", 0.008403361344537815], ["authentic", 0.008403361344537815], ["helsinki", 0.008403361344537815], ["noises", 0.008403361344537815], ["person", 0.008403361344537815], ["time", 0.008403361344537815], ["playing", 0.008403361344537815]], "sentiment": ["As I\u2019ve said: I recently went back to Dresden with my friend O\u2019Hare.

O\u2019Hare was supposed to get on in Philadelphia and I was supposed to get on in Boston, and off we\u2019d go. But Boston was socked in, so the plane flew straight to Frankfurt from Philadelphia. And I became a non-person in the Boston fog, and Lufthansa put me in a limousine with some other non-persons and sent us to a motel for a non-night.\nThe time would not pass. Somebody was playing with the clocks, and not only with the electric clocks, but the wind-up kind, too. The second hand on my watch would twitch once, and a year would pass, and then it would twitch again.\nThere was nothing I could do about it. As an Earthling, I had to believe whatever clocks said\u2014and calendars.\nI had two books with me, which I\u2019d meant to read on the plane. One was Words for the Wind, by Theodore Roethke, and this is what I found in there:\nI wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.\nI feel my fate in what I cannot fear.\nI learn by going where I have to go.\nMy other book was Erika Ostrovsky\u2019s C\u00e9line and His Vision. C\u00e9line was a brave French soldier in the First World War\u2014until his skull was cracked. After that he couldn\u2019t sleep, and there were noises in his head.

said Rumfoord. \"When I ran my space ship into the chrono-synclastic infundibulum, it came to me in a flash that everything that ever has been always will be, and everything that ever will be always has been.\" He chuckled again. \"Knowing that rather takes the glamour out of fortunetelling\u2014makes it the simplest, most obvious thing imaginable.\"\n\"You told your wife everything that was going to happen to her?\" said Constant. This was a glancing question. Constant had no interest in what was going to happen to Rumfoord\u2019s wife. He was ravenous for news of himself In asking about Rumfoord\u2019s wife, he was being coy.\n\"Well\u2014not everything,\" said Rumfoord. \"She wouldn\u2019t let me tell her everything. What little I did tell her quite spoiled her appetite for more.\"\n\"I\u2014I see,\" said Constant, not seeing at all.\n\"Yes,\" said Rumfoord genially, \"I told her that you and she were to be married on Mars.\" He shrugged. \"Not married exactly\u2014\" he said, \"but bred by the Martians\u2014like farm animals.\"\nWinston Niles Rumfoord was a member of the one true American class. The class was a true one because its limits had been clearly defined for at least two centuries\u2014clearly defined for anyone with an eye for definitions. From Rumfoord\u2019s small class had come a tenth of America\u2019s presidents, a quarter of its explorers, a third of its Eastern Seaboard governors, a half of its full-time ornithologists, three-quarters of its great yachtsmen, and virtually all of its underwriters of the deficits of grand opera. It was a class singularly free of quacks, with the notable exception of political quacks. The political quackery was a means of gaining office\u2014and was never carried into private life. Once in office, members of the class became, almost without exception, magnificently responsible.\nIf Rumfoord accused the Martians of breeding people as though people were no better than farm animals, he was accusing the Martians of doing no more than his own class had done. The strength of his class depended to some extent on sound money management\u2014but depended to a much larger extent on marriages based cynically on the sorts of children likely to be produced.\nHealthy, charming, wise children were the desiderata.\nThe most competent, if humorless, analysis of Rumfoord\u2019s class is, beyond question, Waltham Kittredge\u2019s The American Philosopher Kings. It was Kittredge who proved that the class was in fact a family, with its loose ends neatly turned back into a hard core of consanguinity through the agency of cousin marriages. Rumfoord and his wife, for instance, were third cousins, and detested each other.\nAnd when Rumfoord\u2019s class was diagramed by Kittredge, it resembled nothing so much as the hard, ball-like knot known as a monkey\u2019s fist.", 0.12523504273504274], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "if-this-isnt-nice-what-is": {"tfidf": [["child", 0.030303030303030304], ["money", 0.020202020202020204], ["corner", 0.020202020202020204], ["reasonable", 0.020202020202020204], ["computer", 0.020202020202020204], ["blue", 0.020202020202020204], ["britannica", 0.020202020202020204], ["mailbox", 0.020202020202020204], ["teaches", 0.020202020202020204], ["informed", 0.020202020202020204], ["educated", 0.020202020202020204], ["persons", 0.020202020202020204], ["souls", 0.010101010101010102], ["noblest", 0.010101010101010102], ["human", 0.010101010101010102], ["find", 0.010101010101010102], ["feeding", 0.010101010101010102], ["disgusting", 0.010101010101010102], ["forbes", 0.010101010101010102], ["arranged", 0.010101010101010102], ["wouldn", 0.010101010101010102], ["big", 0.010101010101010102], ["choice", 0.010101010101010102], ["putting", 0.010101010101010102], ["preparing", 0.010101010101010102], ["word", 0.010101010101010102], ["fields", 0.010101010101010102], ["bless", 0.010101010101010102], ["bad", 0.010101010101010102], ["stuff", 0.010101010101010102], ["eh", 0.010101010101010102], ["bullfrog", 0.010101010101010102], ["hard", 0.010101010101010102], ["tvs", 0.010101010101010102], ["best", 0.010101010101010102], ["abc", 0.010101010101010102], ["god", 0.010101010101010102], ["teaching", 0.010101010101010102], ["rational", 0.010101010101010102], ["body", 0.010101010101010102], ["alphabetically", 0.010101010101010102], ["men", 0.010101010101010102], ["greedy", 0.010101010101010102], ["graduates", 0.010101010101010102], ["healing", 0.010101010101010102], ["address", 0.010101010101010102], ["news", 0.010101010101010102], ["precious", 0.010101010101010102], ["improve", 0.010101010101010102], ["great", 0.010101010101010102], ["country", 0.010101010101010102], ["computers", 0.010101010101010102], ["favorite", 0.010101010101010102], ["minds", 0.010101010101010102], ["foreign", 0.010101010101010102], ["magazine", 0.010101010101010102], ["place", 0.010101010101010102], ["honor", 0.010101010101010102], ["letter", 0.010101010101010102], ["profession", 0.010101010101010102], ["arts", 0.010101010101010102], ["working", 0.010101010101010102], ["top", 0.010101010101010102], ["painted", 0.010101010101010102], ["company", 0.010101010101010102], ["saner", 0.010101010101010102], ["hear", 0.010101010101010102], ["technologies", 0.010101010101010102], ["wise", 0.010101010101010102], ["nations", 0.010101010101010102], ["planet", 0.010101010101010102], ["fun", 0.010101010101010102], ["education", 0.010101010101010102], ["democracy", 0.010101010101010102], ["moist", 0.010101010101010102], ["book", 0.010101010101010102], ["encyclopedia", 0.010101010101010102], ["dehumanizing", 0.010101010101010102], ["ball", 0.010101010101010102], ["kinds", 0.010101010101010102], ["students", 0.010101010101010102], ["unattractive", 0.010101010101010102], ["asked", 0.010101010101010102], ["green", 0.010101010101010102], ["enter", 0.010101010101010102], ["bodies", 0.010101010101010102]], "sentiment": ["A computer teaches a child what a computer can become.\nAn educated human being teaches a child what a child can become.\nBad men just want your bodies.

savages.\nThe two older cruise ships with which the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was meant to compete had gone out of business before the struggle could begin. Both had been booked to capacity for many months to come, but then, because of the financial crisis, they had been swamped with cancellations. They were anchored in backwaters of the marshland now, out of sight of the city, and far from any road or habitation. Their owners had stripped them of their electronic gear and other valuables\u2014in anticipation of a prolonged period of lawlessness.\nEcuador, after all, like the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, was mostly lava and ash, and so could not begin to feed its nine million people. It was bankrupt, and so could no longer buy food from countries with plenty of topsoil, so the seaport of Guayaquil was idle, and the people were beginning to starve to death.\nBusiness was business.\nNeighboring Peru and Colombia were bankrupt, too. The only ship at the Guayaquil waterfront other than the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was a rusty Colombian freighter, the San Mateo, stranded there for want of the means to buy food or fuel. She was anchored offshore, and had been there so long that an enormous raft of vegetable matter had built up around her anchor line. A baby elephant might have reached the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands on a raft that size.\nMexico and Chile and Brazil and Argentina were likewise bankrupt\u2014and Indonesia and the Philippines and Pakistan and India and Thailand and Italy and Ireland and Belgium and Turkey. Whole nations were suddenly in the same situation as the San Mateo, unable to buy with their paper money and coins, or their written promises to pay later, even the barest essentials. Persons with anything life sustaining to sell, fellow citizens as well as foreigners, were refusing to exchange their goods for money. They were suddenly saying to people with nothing but paper representations of wealth, \u201cWake up, you idiots!

It\u2019s a pessimistic story.\nThe question is, does this system I\u2019ve devised help us in the evaluation of literature? Perhaps a real masterpiece cannot be crucified on a cross of this design. How about Hamlet? It\u2019s a pretty good piece of work I\u2019d say. Is anybody going to argue that it isn\u2019t? I don\u2019t have to draw a new line, because Hamlet\u2019s situation is the same as Cinderella\u2019s, except that the sexes are reversed.\nHis father has just died. He\u2019s despondent. And right away his mother went and married his uncle, who\u2019s a bastard. So Hamlet is going along on the same level as Cinderella when his friend Horatio comes up to him and says, \u201cHamlet, listen there\u2019s this thing up in the parapet, I think maybe you\u2019d better talk to it. It\u2019s your dad.\u201d So Hamlet goes up and talks to this, you know, fairly substantial apparition there. And this thing says, \u201cI\u2019m your father, I was murdered, you gotta avenge me, it was your uncle did it, here\u2019s how.\u201d\nWell, was this good news or bad news? To this day we don\u2019t know if that ghost was really Hamlet\u2019s father. If you have messed around with Ouija boards, you know there are malicious spirits floating around, liable to tell you anything, and you shouldn\u2019t believe them. Madame Blavatsky, who knew more about the spirit world than anybody else, said you are a fool to take any apparition seriously, because they are often malicious and they are frequently the souls of people who were murdered, were suicides, or were terribly cheated in life in one way or another, and they are out for revenge.\nSo we don\u2019t know whether this thing was really Hamlet\u2019s father or if it was good news or bad news. And neither does Hamlet. But he says okay, I got a way to check this out. I\u2019ll hire actors to act out the way the ghost said my father was murdered by my uncle, and I\u2019ll put on this show and see what my uncle makes of it. So he puts on this show. And it\u2019s not like Perry Mason. His uncle doesn\u2019t go crazy and say, \u201cI-I-You got me, you got me, I did it, I did it.\u201d It flops. Neither good news nor bad news. After this flop Hamlet ends up talking with his mother when the drapes move, so he thinks his uncle is back there and he says, \u201cAll right, I am so sick of being so damn indecisive,\u201d and he sticks his rapier through the drapery. Well, who falls out? This windbag, Polonius. This Rush Limbaugh. And Shakespeare regards him as a fool and quite disposable.\nYou know, dumb parents think that the advice that Polonius gave to his kids when they were going away was what parents should always tell their kids, and it\u2019s the dumbest possible advice, and Shakespeare even thought it was hilarious.\n\u201cNeither a borrower nor a lender be.\u201d But what else is life but endless lending and borrowing, give and take?\n\u201cThis above all, to thine own self be true.\u201d Be an egomaniac!\nNeither good news nor bad news. Hamlet didn\u2019t get arrested. He\u2019s prince. He can kill anybody he wants. So he goes along, and finally he gets in a duel, and he\u2019s killed. Well, did he go to heaven or did he go to hell? Quite a difference. Cinderella or Kafka\u2019s cockroach? I don\u2019t think Shakespeare believed in a heaven or hell any more than I do. And so we don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s good news or bad news.\nI have just demonstrated to you that Shakespeare was as poor a storyteller as any Arapaho.", 0.06761246000376438], "title": "A Man without a Country"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["will", 0.045714285714285714], ["nature", 0.02857142857142857], ["god", 0.022857142857142857], ["american", 0.017142857142857144], ["lesson", 0.017142857142857144], ["union", 0.017142857142857144], ["time", 0.017142857142857144], ["groundwork", 0.011428571428571429], ["good", 0.011428571428571429], ["mention", 0.011428571428571429], ["trouble", 0.011428571428571429], ["dare", 0.011428571428571429], ["house", 0.011428571428571429], ["struggle", 0.011428571428571429], ["ace", 0.011428571428571429], ["freedom", 0.011428571428571429], ["letter", 0.011428571428571429], ["anti", 0.011428571428571429], ["kings", 0.011428571428571429], ["spades", 0.011428571428571429], ["country", 0.011428571428571429], ["aces", 0.011428571428571429], ["book", 0.011428571428571429], ["thomas", 0.005714285714285714], ["guided", 0.005714285714285714], ["queen", 0.005714285714285714], ["writers", 0.005714285714285714], ["rest", 0.005714285714285714], ["defended", 0.005714285714285714], ["dakota", 0.005714285714285714], ["birds", 0.005714285714285714], ["highest", 0.005714285714285714], ["troubles", 0.005714285714285714], ["civil", 0.005714285714285714], ["vital", 0.005714285714285714], ["parents", 0.005714285714285714], ["kuznetzov", 0.005714285714285714], ["inferior", 0.005714285714285714], ["return", 0.005714285714285714], ["holding", 0.005714285714285714], ["harmed", 0.005714285714285714], ["trees", 0.005714285714285714], ["communities", 0.005714285714285714], ["burned", 0.005714285714285714], ["seldom", 0.005714285714285714], ["laying", 0.005714285714285714], ["drake", 0.005714285714285714], ["remind", 0.005714285714285714], ["officer", 0.005714285714285714], ["foolish", 0.005714285714285714], ["wrote", 0.005714285714285714], ["policemen", 0.005714285714285714], ["people", 0.005714285714285714], ["sex", 0.005714285714285714], ["hair", 0.005714285714285714], ["taught", 0.005714285714285714], ["sands", 0.005714285714285714], ["divine", 0.005714285714285714], ["reasons", 0.005714285714285714], ["friend", 0.005714285714285714], ["plays", 0.005714285714285714], ["blacks", 0.005714285714285714], ["prisons", 0.005714285714285714], ["milk", 0.005714285714285714], ["granola", 0.005714285714285714], ["oration", 0.005714285714285714], ["learned", 0.005714285714285714], ["numerous", 0.005714285714285714], ["exercise", 0.005714285714285714], ["told", 0.005714285714285714], ["terms", 0.005714285714285714], ["attention", 0.005714285714285714], ["imagine", 0.005714285714285714], ["teach", 0.005714285714285714], ["teacher", 0.005714285714285714], ["care", 0.005714285714285714], ["citizens", 0.005714285714285714], ["thing", 0.005714285714285714], ["afternoon", 0.005714285714285714], ["guardians", 0.005714285714285714], ["menial", 0.005714285714285714], ["york", 0.005714285714285714], ["point", 0.005714285714285714], ["whites", 0.005714285714285714], ["insist", 0.005714285714285714], ["ussr", 0.005714285714285714], ["city", 0.005714285714285714], ["spoke", 0.005714285714285714], ["freedoms", 0.005714285714285714], ["bees", 0.005714285714285714], ["lot", 0.005714285714285714], ["white", 0.005714285714285714], ["lovely", 0.005714285714285714], ["duties", 0.005714285714285714], ["north", 0.005714285714285714], ["moscow", 0.005714285714285714], ["unknowable", 0.005714285714285714], ["courts", 0.005714285714285714], ["surrender", 0.005714285714285714], ["jefferson", 0.005714285714285714], ["work", 0.005714285714285714], ["critic", 0.005714285714285714], ["teachers", 0.005714285714285714], ["cards", 0.005714285714285714], ["sooner", 0.005714285714285714], ["distinguished", 0.005714285714285714], ["violence", 0.005714285714285714], ["willingness", 0.005714285714285714], ["played", 0.005714285714285714], ["felix", 0.005714285714285714], ["beats", 0.005714285714285714], ["allowed", 0.005714285714285714], ["curl", 0.005714285714285714], ["vanish", 0.005714285714285714], ["things", 0.005714285714285714], ["government", 0.005714285714285714], ["analogy", 0.005714285714285714], ["higher", 0.005714285714285714], ["poor", 0.005714285714285714], ["explaining", 0.005714285714285714], ["intended", 0.005714285714285714], ["island", 0.005714285714285714], ["liberties", 0.005714285714285714], ["lay", 0.005714285714285714], ["gatsby", 0.005714285714285714], ["law", 0.005714285714285714], ["grow", 0.005714285714285714], ["man", 0.005714285714285714], ["understands", 0.005714285714285714], ["destinies", 0.005714285714285714], ["natural", 0.005714285714285714], ["clear", 0.005714285714285714], ["children", 0.005714285714285714], ["slaves", 0.005714285714285714], ["soviet", 0.005714285714285714], ["playing", 0.005714285714285714], ["laws", 0.005714285714285714]], "sentiment": ["\u201cCertainly. Granola never harmed anybody, nor the birds and bees\u2014not to mention milk. God is unknowable, but nature is explaining herself all the time. What has she told us so far? That blacks are obviously inferior to whites, for one thing, and intended for menial work on white man\u2019s terms. This clear lesson from nature, we should remind ourselves from time to time, allowed Thomas Jefferson to own slaves. Imagine that.\n\u201cWhat troubles me most about my lovely country is that its children are seldom taught that American freedom will vanish, if, when they grow up, and in the exercise of their duties as citizens, they insist that our courts and policemen and prisons be guided by divine or natural law.\n\u201cMost teachers and parents and guardians do not teach this vital lesson because they themselves never learned it, or because they dare not. Why dare they not? People can get into a lot of trouble in this country, and often have to be defended by the American Civil Liberties Union, for laying the groundwork for the lesson, which is this: That no one really understands nature or God. It is my willingness to lay this groundwork, and not sex or violence, which has got my poor book in such trouble in Island Trees\u2014and in Drake, North Dakota, where the book was burned, and in many other communities too numerous to mention.\n\u201cI have not said that our government is anti-nature and anti-God. I have said that it is non-nature and non-God, for very good reasons that could curl your hair.\n\u201cWell\u2014all good things must come to an end, they say. So American freedom will come to an end, too, sooner or later. How will it end? As all freedoms end: by the surrender of our destinies to the highest laws.\n\u201cTo return to my foolish analogy of playing cards: kings and aces will be played. Nobody else will have anything higher than a queen.\n\u201cThere will be a struggle between those holding kings and aces.

Lo! One old American responds, comes tottering out. There is no one to bid him farewell, nor does he look up and down the street for someone to wish him well. He carries a brown paper parcel tied with twine. He is going somewhere, no doubt to die.\n\"He is taking leave of the only town he's ever known, the only life he's ever known. But he isn't thinking about saying goodbye to his universe. His whole being is intent on not offending the mighty bus driver, who looks down fumingly from his blue leather throne. Wupps! Too bad! The old American crawled aboard in fair shape, but now he can't find his ticket. He finds it at last, too late, too late. The driver is filled with rage. He slams the door, starts off with a savage clashing of gears, blows his horn at an old American woman crossing the street, rattles the window-panes. Hate, hate, hate.\"\n\"Eliot\u2014is there a river there?\"\n\"My telephone booth is in the broad valley of an open sewer called the Ohio. The Ohio is thirty miles to the south. Carp as big as atomic submarines fatten on the sludge of the sons and grandsons of the pioneers. Beyond the river lie the once green hills of Kentucky, the promised land of Dan'l Boone, now gulched and gashed by strip mines, some of which are owned by a charitable and cultural foundation endowed by an interesting old American family named Rosewater.\n\"On that side of the river, the Rosewater Foundation's holdings are somewhat diffuse. On this side, though, right around my phone booth, for a distance of about fifteen miles in any direction you care to go, the Foundation owns almost everything. The Foundation, however, has left the booming night-crawler business wide open. Signs on every home proclaim, 'Night-crawlers for Sale.'\n\"The key industry here, hogs and night-crawlers aside, is the making of saws. The saw factory is owned by the Foundation, of course. Because saws are so important here, the athletes of Noah Rosewater Memorial High School are known as 'The Fighting Sawmakers.' Actually, there aren't many sawmakers left. The saw factory is almost fully automatic now. If you can work a pinball machine, you can run the factory, make twelve thousand saws a day.\n\"A young man, a Fighting Sawmaker about eighteen years old, is strolling insouciantly past my phone booth now, wearing the sacred blue and white. He looks dangerous, but he wouldn't harm a soul. His two best subjects in school were Citizenship and Problems in Modern American Democracy, both taught by his basketball coach. He understands that anything violent he might do would not only weaken the Republic, but would ruin his own life, too. There is no work for him in Rosewater. There is damn little work for him anywhere. He often carries birth-control devices in his pocket, which many people find alarming and disgusting. The same people find it alarming and disgusting that the boy's father did not use birth-control devices. One more kid rotten-spoiled by postwar abundance, one more princeling with goose-berry eyes. He's meeting his girl now, a girl not much older than fourteen\u2014 a five-and-ten-cent-store Cleopatra, a four-letter word.\n\"Across the street is the firehouse\u2014four trucks, three drunks, sixteen dogs, and one cheerful, sober young man with a can of metal polish.\"", 0.0056343455256498715], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["company",

that was surely the impression young Alexander Hamilton McCone had of the militiamen who arrived at the factory on Christmas Eve: that these were not soldiers. They were brought on a special train to a siding inside the factory\u2019s high iron fence. They straggled out of the car and onto a loading platform as though they were ordinary passengers on various errands. Their uniforms were only partly buttoned, and often mis-buttoned, at that. Several had lost their hats. Almost all carried laughably unmilitary suitcases and parcels.\nTheir officers? Their captain was the postmaster of Greenfield, Ohio. Their two. lieutenants were twin sons of the president of the Greenfield Bank and Trust Company. The postmaster and the banker had both done local favors for the governor. The commissions were their rewards. And the officers, in turn, had rewarded those who had pleased them in some way by making them sergeants or corporals. And the privates, in turn, voters or sons of voters, had it within their power, if they felt like using it, to ruin the lives of their superiors with contempt and ridicule, which could go on for generations.\nThere on the loading platform at the Cuyahoga Bridge and Iron Company old Daniel McCone finally had to ask one of the many soldiers milling about and eating at the same time, \u201cWho is in charge here?\u201d\nAs luck would have it, he had put the question to the captain, who told him this: \u201cWell\u2014as much as anybody, I guess I am.\u201d\nTo their credit, and although armed with bayonets and live ammunition, the militiamen would not harm a single soul on the following day.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey were quartered in an idled machine shop. They slept in the aisles. Each one had brought his own food from home. They had hams and roasted chickens and cakes and pies. They ate whatever they pleased and whenever they pleased, and turned the machine shop into a picnic ground. They left the place looking like a village dump. They did not know any better.\nYes, and old Daniel McCone and his two sons spent the night in the factory, too\u2014on camp cots in their offices at the foot of the bell tower, and with loaded revolvers under their pillows. When would they have their Christmas dinner? At three o\u2019clock on the following afternoon. The trouble would surely be over by then. Young Alexander was to make use of his fine education, his father had told him, by composing and delivering an appropriate prayer of thanksgiving before they ate that meal.\nRegular company guards, augmented by Pinkerton agents and city policemen, meanwhile took turns patrolling the company fence all night. The company guards, ordinarily armed only with pistols, had rifles, and shotguns, too, borrowed from friends or brought from home.\nFour Pinkerton men were allowed to sleep all through the night.

meter from the bottom, fifth row from the left, on the east wall.\n\u201cBeyond help,\u201d he said. Lathe group three, Building 58, had been good in its day, but was showing wear and becoming a misfit in the slick, streamlined setup, where there was no place for erratic behavior. \u201cBasically, it wasn\u2019t built for the job it\u2019s doing anyway. I look for the buzzer to go off any day now, and that\u2019ll be the end.\u201d\nIn each meter box, in addition to the instrument, the jewel, and the warning lamp, was a buzzer. The buzzer was the signal for a unit\u2019s complete breakdown.\n2\nTHE SHAH OF BRATPUHR, spiritual leader of 6,000,000 members of the Kolhouri sect, wizened and wise and dark as cocoa, encrusted with gold brocade and constellations of twinkling gems, sank deep into the royal-blue cushions of the limousine\u2014like a priceless brooch in its gift box.\nOn the other side of the limousine\u2019s rear seat sat Doctor Ewing J. Halyard, of the United States Department of State, a heavy, florid, urbane gentleman of forty. He wore a flowing sandy mustache, a colored shirt, a boutonniere, and a waistcoat contrasting with his dark suit, and wore them with such poise that one was sure he\u2019d just come from a distinguished company where everyone dressed in this manner. The fact was that only Doctor Halyard did. And he got away with it beautifully.\nBetween them, nervous, grinning, young, and forever apologetic for his own lack of \u00e9clat or power, was Khashdrahr Miasma, the interpreter, and nephew of the Shah, who had learned English from a tutor, but had never before been outside of the Shah\u2019s palace.\n\u201cKhabu?\u201d said the Shah in his high, frail voice.\nHalyard had been with the Shah for three days now and was able to understand, without Khashdrahr\u2019s help, five of the Shah\u2019s expressions. \u201cKhabu\u201d meant \u201cwhere?\u201d \u201cSiki\u201d meant \u201cwhat?\u201d \u201cAkka sahn\u201d meant \u201cwhy?\u201d \u201cBrahous brahouna, houna saki\u201d was a combination of blessing and thanks, and Sumklish was the sacred Kolhouri drink which Khashdrahr carried in a hip flask for the Shah.\nThe Shah had left his military and spiritual fastness in the mountains to see what he could learn in the most powerful nation on earth for the good of his people.

was 1 of the few Confederate soldiers to reach the Union lines during Pickett\u2019s Charge. That Johnny Reb died in ecstasy among his enemies, believing that he had shot Abraham Lincoln. A crumbling newspaper account I have found here in what used to be the college library, which is now the prison library, gives his last words as follows: \u201cGo home, Bluebellies. Old Satan\u2019s daid.\u201d\nDuring my 3 years in Vietnam, I certainly heard plenty of last words by dying American footsoldiers. Not 1 of them, however, had illusions that he had somehow accomplished something worthwhile in the process of making the Supreme Sacrifice.\nOne boy of only 18 said to me while he was dying and I was holding him in my arms, \u201cDirty joke, dirty joke.\u201d\n3\nELIAS TARKINGTON, THE severely wounded Abraham Lincoln look-alike, was brought home in 1 of his own wagons to Scipio, to his estate overlooking the town and lake.\nHe was not well educated, and was more a mechanic than a scientist, and so spent his last 3 years trying to invent what anyone familiar with Newton\u2019s Laws would have known was an impossibility, a perpetual-motion machine. He had no fewer than 27 contraptions built, which he foolishly expected to go on running, after he had given them an initial spin or whack, until Judgment Day.\nI found 19 of those stubborn, mocking machines in the attic of what used to be their inventor\u2019s mansion, which in my time was the home of the College President, about a year after I came to work at Tarkington. I brought them back downstairs and into the 20th Century. Some of my students and I cleaned them up and restored any parts that had deteriorated during the intervening 100 years. At the least they were exquisite jewelry, with garnets and amethysts for bearings, with arms and legs of exotic woods, with tumbling balls of ivory, with chutes and counterweights of silver. It was as though dying Elias hoped to overwhelm science with the magic of precious materials.\nThe longest my students and I could get the best of them to run was 51 seconds. Some eternity!\nTO ME, AND I passed this on to my students, the restored devices demonstrated not only how quickly anything on Earth runs down without steady infusions of energy. They reminded us, too, of the craftsmanship no longer practiced in the town below. Nobody down there in our time could make things that cunning and beautiful.\nYes, and we took the 10 machines we agreed were the most beguiling, and we put them on permanent exhibit in the foyer of this library underneath a sign whose words can surely be applied to this whole ruined planet nowadays:", 0.19794784580498864], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["groszinger", 0.033783783783783786], ["general", 0.02702702702702703], ["telegrams", 0.02027027027027027], ["god", 0.02027027027027027], ["friend", 0.02027027027027027], ["scotia", 0.02027027027027027], ["telegram", 0.013513513513513514], ["major", 0.013513513513513514], ["hell", 0.013513513513513514], ["rice", 0.013513513513513514], ["populated", 0.013513513513513514], ["opened", 0.013513513513513514], ["open", 0.013513513513513514], ["evansville", 0.013513513513513514], ["andrew", 0.013513513513513514], ["hoax", 0.013513513513513514], ["chief", 0.013513513513513514], ["help", 0.006756756756756757], ["brain", 0.006756756756756757], ["ge", 0.006756756756756757], ["scientist", 0.006756756756756757], ["thumbs", 0.006756756756756757], ["paul", 0.006756756756756757], ["shrugged", 0.006756756756756757], ["children", 0.006756756756756757], ["digest", 0.006756756756756757], ["tobin", 0.006756756756756757], ["police", 0.006756756756756757], ["hunting", 0.006756756756756757], ["conclusions", 0.006756756756756757], ["failey", 0.006756756756756757], ["going", 0.006756756756756757], ["surprised", 0.006756756756756757], ["real", 0.006756756756756757], ["spectacular", 0.006756756756756757], ["records", 0.006756756756756757], ["hands", 0.006756756756756757], ["foot", 0.006756756756756757], ["february", 0.006756756756756757], ["brother", 0.006756756756756757], ["insane", 0.006756756756756757], ["lecturing", 0.006756756756756757], ["intelligence", 0.006756756756756757], ["ritter", 0.006756756756756757], ["second", 0.006756756756756757], ["fist", 0.006756756756756757], ["1927", 0.006756756756756757], ["ghosts", 0.006756756756756757], ["twiddled", 0.006756756756756757], ["accomplish", 0.006756756756756757], ["space", 0.006756756756756757], ["wadded", 0.006756756756756757], ["waiting", 0.006756756756756757], ["pamela", 0.006756756756756757], ["patient", 0.006756756756756757], ["business", 0.006756756756756757], ["missing", 0.006756756756756757], ["pose", 0.006756756756756757], ["outer", 0.006756756756756757], ["problem", 0.006756756756756757], ["box", 0.006756756756756757], ["accident", 0.006756756756756757], ["ahead", 0.006756756756756757], ["messages", 0.006756756756756757], ["place", 0.006756756756756757], ["planned", 0.006756756756756757], ["superstitious", 0.006756756756756757], ["named", 0.006756756756756757], ["addresses", 0.006756756756756757], ["conclude", 0.006756756756756757], ["folded", 0.006756756756756757], ["wastebasket", 0.006756756756756757], ["widower", 0.006756756756756757], ["names", 0.006756756756756757], ["message", 0.006756756756756757], ["engineer", 0.006756756756756757], ["unopened", 0.006756756756756757], ["checked", 0.006756756756756757], ["deal", 0.006756756756756757], ["army", 0.006756756756756757], ["leading", 0.006756756756756757], ["people", 0.006756756756756757], ["needed", 0.006756756756756757], ["listed", 0.006756756756756757], ["expected", 0.006756756756756757], ["threw", 0.006756756756756757], ["sort", 0.006756756756756757], ["started", 0.006756756756756757], ["generals", 0.006756756756756757], ["hopes", 0.006756756756756757], ["voices", 0.006756756756756757], ["convinced", 0.006756756756756757], ["spirit", 0.006756756756756757], ["room", 0.006756756756756757], ["17", 0.006756756756756757], ["classes", 0.006756756756756757], ["suppose", 0.006756756756756757], ["owns", 0.006756756756756757], ["dane", 0.006756756756756757], ["deceased", 0.006756756756756757], ["hears", 0.006756756756756757], ["pulling", 0.006756756756756757], ["dropped", 0.006756756756756757], ["priestlike", 0.006756756756756757], ["firmly", 0.006756756756756757], ["handed", 0.006756756756756757], ["details", 0.006756756756756757], ["laughed", 0.006756756756756757], ["damon", 0.006756756756756757], ["freshman", 0.006756756756756757], ["lap", 0.006756756756756757], ["died", 0.006756756756756757], ["johnson", 0.006756756756756757], ["wife", 0.006756756756756757], ["physics", 0.006756756756756757], ["thought", 0.006756756756756757], ["coal", 0.006756756756756757], ["carrying", 0.006756756756756757], ["harvey", 0.006756756756756757], ["businessman", 0.006756756756756757], ["1577", 0.006756756756756757], ["furnish", 0.006756756756756757]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHe still hears the voices, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d The General dropped two unopened telegrams in Groszinger\u2019s lap. \u201cThought you might like to be the one to open these.\u201d\nGroszinger laughed. \u201cWent ahead and checked Scotia and Evansville, did you?

No reputable publisher had ever heard of him, for that matter, even though he had written one hundred and seventeen novels and two thousand short stories by the time he met Dwayne.\nHe made carbon copies of nothing he wrote. He mailed off manuscripts without enclosing stamped, self-addressed envelopes for their safe return. Sometimes he didn\u2019t even include a return address. He got names and addresses of publishers from magazines devoted to the writing business, which he read avidly in the periodical rooms of public libraries. He thus got in touch with a firm called World Classics Library, which published hard-core pornography in Los Angeles, California. They used his stories, which usually didn\u2019t even have women in them, to give bulk to books and magazines of salacious pictures.\nThey never told him where or when he might expect to find himself in print. Here is what they paid him: doodley-squat.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey didn\u2019t even send him complimentary copies of the books and magazines in which he appeared, so he had to search them out in pornography stores.

He wrote a novel, for instance, about an Earthling named Delmore Skag, a bachelor in a neighborhood where everybody else had enormous families. And Skag was a scientist, and he found a way to reproduce himself in chicken soup. He would shave living cells from the palm of his right hand, mix them with the soup, and expose the soup to cosmic rays.

Street.\nCommunism is what Karl Marx hoped could be an economic scheme for making industrialized nations take as good care of people, and especially of children and the old and disabled, as tribes and extended families used to do, before they were dispersed by the Industrial Revolution.\nAnd I think maybe we might be wise to stop badmouthing Communism so much, not because we think it\u2019s a good idea, but because our grandchildren and great-grandchildren are now in hock up to their eyeballs to the Communist Chinese.\nAnd the Chinese Communists also have a big and superbly equipped army, something we don\u2019t have. We\u2019re too cheap. We just want to nuke everybody.\nBut there are still plenty of people who will tell you that the most evil thing about Karl Marx was what he said about religion. He said it was the opium of the lower classes, as though he thought religion was bad for people, and he wanted to get rid of it.\nBut when Marx said that, back in the 1840s, his use of the word \u201copium\u201d wasn\u2019t simply metaphorical. Back then real opium was the only painkiller available, for toothaches or cancer of the throat, or whatever. He himself had used it.\nAs a sincere friend of the downtrodden, he was saying he was glad they had something which could ease their pain at least a little bit, which was religion. He liked religion for doing that, and certainly didn\u2019t want to abolish it. OK?\nHe might have said today as I say tonight, \u201cReligion can be Tylenol for a lot of unhappy people, and I\u2019m so glad it works.\u201d\nAbout the Chinese Communists: They are obviously much better at business than we are, and maybe a lot smarter, Communists or not. I mean, look how much better they do in our schools over here. Face it! My son, Mark, a pediatrician, was on the Admissions Committee of the Harvard Medical School a while back, and he said that if they had played the admissions game fairly, half of the entering class would be Asian women.\nBut back to Karl Marx: How subservient to Jesus, or to a humane God Almighty, were the leaders of this country back in the 1840s, when Marx said such a supposedly evil thing about religion? They had made it perfectly legal to own human slaves, and weren\u2019t going to let women vote or hold public office, God forbid, for another eighty years.", 0.09983076563958918], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
