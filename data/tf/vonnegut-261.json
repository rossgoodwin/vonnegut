Leaning out of a window was Lou Flammer, David\u2019s supervisor. \"Don\u2019t shoot until we get a picture of him alive,\" commanded Flammer. He pulled a photographer out of the limousine, and pushed him into the front rank.\nFlammer saw David standing alone by the fence, his back to a gate. \"Good boy, Potter,\" called Flammer. \"Right on the ball! Photographer got lost, and I had to bring him here myself. \"\nThe photographer fired his flash bulbs. The deer bucked and sprinted along the fence toward David. David unwired the, gate, opened it wide. A second later the deer\u2019s white tail was flashing through the woods and gone.\nThe profound silence was broken first by the whistling of a switch engine and then by the click of a latch as David stepped into the woods and closed the gate behind him. He didn\u2019t look back.\n(1955)\nTHE LIE\nIT WAS EARLY SPRINGTIME. Weak sunshine lay cold on old gray frost. Willow twigs against the sky showed the golden haze of fat catkins about to bloom. A black Rolls-Royce streaked up the Connecticut Turnpike from New York City. At the wheel was Ben Barkley, a black chauffeur.\n\"Keep it under the speed limit, Ben,\" said Doctor Remenzel. \"I don\u2019t care how ridiculous any speed limit seems, stay under it. No reason to rush\u2014we have plenty of time.\"\nBen eased off on the throttle. \"Seems like in the springtime she wants to get up and go,\" he said.\n\"Do what you can to keep her down\u2014O.K.?\" said the doctor.", -0.02740099406766074], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["thesis", 0.03508771929824561], ["dear", 0.03508771929824561], ["max", 0.03508771929824561], ["proposal", 0.03508771929824561], ["societies", 0.03508771929824561], ["primitive", 0.017543859649122806], ["love", 0.017543859649122806], ["remained", 0.017543859649122806], ["influence", 0.017543859649122806], ["29", 0.017543859649122806], ["committed", 0.017543859649122806], ["cold", 0.017543859649122806], ["leaving", 0.017543859649122806], ["relating", 0.017543859649122806], ["jerome", 0.017543859649122806], ["august", 0.017543859649122806], ["leave", 0.017543859649122806], ["suicide", 0.017543859649122806], ["swallowing", 0.017543859649122806], ["kurt", 0.017543859649122806], ["jerry", 0.017543859649122806], ["neurotic", 0.017543859649122806], ["member", 0.017543859649122806], ["eager", 0.017543859649122806], ["finally", 0.017543859649122806], ["sydney", 0.017543859649122806], ["department", 0.017543859649122806], ["wanting", 0.017543859649122806], ["scheme", 0.017543859649122806], ["worked", 0.017543859649122806], ["vonnegut", 0.017543859649122806], ["klinkowitz", 0.017543859649122806], ["city", 0.017543859649122806], ["industrialized", 0.017543859649122806], ["couple", 0.017543859649122806], ["rejected", 0.017543859649122806], ["cheers", 0.017543859649122806], ["loree", 0.017543859649122806], ["york", 0.017543859649122806], ["disreputable", 0.017543859649122806], ["dr", 0.017543859649122806], ["slotkin", 0.017543859649122806], ["wilkinson", 0.017543859649122806], ["remember", 0.017543859649122806], ["brilliant", 0.017543859649122806], ["study", 0.017543859649122806], ["times", 0.017543859649122806], ["thought", 0.017543859649122806], ["1977", 0.017543859649122806], ["cyanide", 0.017543859649122806], ["visited", 0.017543859649122806], ["parallel", 0.017543859649122806]], "sentiment": ["TO JEROME KLINKOWITZ\nDear Jerry\u2014\n[\u2026] About the thesis proposal: I worked it up with a Dr. Sydney Slotkin, a brilliant and neurotic member of the department who was not well thought of, and who was on his way out. He was disreputable for relating primitive societies to industrialized societies, for wanting to study them in parallel. My thesis proposal was rejected for being just such a scheme. He had more influence on me than anybody else there, but remained quite cold to me. I visited him a couple of times after leaving. He did not seem to remember me, and was eager for me to leave yet again.
