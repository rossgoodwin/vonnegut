He couldn\u2019t believe it. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to think about it. It didn\u2019t become real to him until late that night, in a dream. In the dream Helmholtz saw a boy with barracuda teeth, with claws like baling hooks. The monster climbed into a window of the high school and dropped to the floor of the band rehearsal room. The monster clawed to shreds the heads of the biggest drum in the state. Helmholtz woke up howling. There was nothing to do but dress and go to the school.\nAt two in the morning, Helmholtz caressed the drum heads in the band rehearsal room, with the night watchman looking on. He rolled the drum back and forth on its cart, and he turned the light inside on and off, on and off. The drum was unharmed. The night watchman left to make his rounds.\nThe band\u2019s treasure house was safe. With the contentment of a miser counting his money, Helmholtz fondled the rest of the instruments, one by one. And then he began to polish the sousaphones. As he polished, he could hear the great horns roaring, could see them flashing in the sunlight, with the Stars and Stripes and the banner of Lincoln High going before.\n\"Yump-yump, tiddle-tiddle, yump-yump, tiddle-tiddle!\" sang Helmholtz happily. \"Yump-yump-yump, ra-a-a-a-a-a, yump-yump, yump-yump\u2014boom!\"\nAs he paused to choose the next number for his imaginary band to play, he heard a furtive noise in the chemistry laboratory next door. Helmholtz sneaked into the hall, jerked open the laboratory door, and flashed on the lights. Jim Donnini had a bottle of acid in either hand. He was splashing acid over the periodic table of the elements, over the blackboards covered with formulas, over the bust of Lavoisier. The scene was the most repulsive thing Helmholtz could have looked upon.\nJim smiled with thin bravado.\n\"Get out,\" said Helmholtz.\n\"What\u2019re you gonna do?\" said Jim.\n\"Clean up. Save what I can,\" said Helmholtz dazedly. He picked up a wad of cotton waste and began wiping up the acid.\n\"You gonna call the cops?\" said Jim.", 0.1441269841269841], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
