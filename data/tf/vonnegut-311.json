boisterous, prosperous workers from Oak Ridge, whose lips had not been zipped. I wish now that I could remember what they told me they were doing. A public relations man at Oak Ridge, Richard Gehman, now dead of alcoholism and five wives (one of them Estelle Parsons, to whom he gave twins), later became a prolific magazine writer and a close friend of mine. His job was to misinform the workers I met as to what they were doing and why.\nYour speculations about AIDS are of course fascinating to me, and I am sending them on to Mark. I tremble for you. Semmelweis came to a bad end, as I\u2019m sure you know. He finally caught on that nobody else really gave a shit about anything, and he slashed his palm on purpose with an infected scalpel. He was the particular hero of the monster Louis Ferdinand C\u00e9line.\nI have spent the summer trying to find out if I am smart enough to write about Darwinism as the dominant religion of our time. The results are inconclusive, and could hardly be anything else, since my I.Q. is (for New York City) a lousy 135.\nI will be taking Mark and his eldest son Zack and my brother Bernard and one of his grown sons, a sweet, celibate, unemployed alcoholic named Terry, blue-fishing off Block Island in a chartered boat this next weekend (September 10\u201311). After that, I will close up the country house and will be in town all winter.

Stepan had made me feel his own great joy at the thought of all the beauty and truth in space. I understood at last, Mr. Ashland, why the suffering would be worthwhile. When I dreamed of space again, I would dream of looking down at our own lovely green ball, dream of looking up at other worlds and seeing them more clearly than they had ever been seen.\nIt was not for the Soviet Union but for the beauty and truth in space, Mr. Ashland, that Stepan worked and died. He did not like to speak of the warlike uses of space. It was Alexei who liked to speak of such things, of the glory of spying on earth from baby moons, of guiding missiles to their targets from baby moons, of mastering the earth with weapons fired from the moon itself. Alexei expected Stepan to share his excitement about thoughts of such childish violence.\nStepan smiled, but only because he loved Alexei. He did not smile about war, or the things a man in a baby moon or on the moon itself could do to an enemy. \"It is a use of science that we may be forced to make, Alexei,\" he said. \"But if such a war happens, nothing will matter any more. Our world will become less fit for life than any other in the solar system.\"\nAlexei has not spoken well of war since.\nStepan and his wife left late that night. He promised to come back before another year had passed, but I never saw him alive again.\nWhen news came that the Soviet Union had fired a man-carrying baby moon into space, I did not know that the man was Stepan. I did not dare to suspect it. I could not wait to see Stepan again, to ask him what the man had said before he took off, how he was dressed, what his comforts were. We were told that we would be able to hear the man speak from space at eight o\u2019clock that night on the radio.\nWe listened. We heard the man speak. The man was Stepan.\nStepan sounded strong. He sounded happy. He sounded proud and decent and wise. We laughed until we cried, Mr. Ashland. We danced. Our Stepan was the most important man alive. He had risen above everyone, and now he was looking down, telling us what our world looked like; looking up, telling us what the other worlds looked like.\nStepan made pleasant jokes about his little house in the sky. He said it was a cylinder ten meters long and four meters in diameter. It could be very cozy. And Stepan told us that there were little windows in his house, and a television camera, and a telescope, and radar, and all manner of instruments. How delightful to live in a time when such things could be! How delightful to be the father of the man who was the eyes, ears, and heart in space for all mankind!\nHe would remain up there for a month, he said. We began to count the days. Every night we listened to a broadcast of recordings of things Stepan had said. We heard nothing about his nosebleeds and his nausea and his crying. We heard only the calm, brave things he had said. And then, on the tenth night, there were no more recordings of Stepan. There was only music at eight o\u2019clock. There was no news of Stepan at all, and we knew he was dead.", 0.21664385793418053], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
