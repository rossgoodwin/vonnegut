I should be cremated as quickly and cheaply as possible, and my ashes should be scattered by family in Barnstable Harbor, not far from the foot of Scudder\u2019s Lane.\nI am not, nor have I ever been a Christian, so I should not be given a funeral or memorial service under any sort of Christian supervision or in any Christian space, and surely not in any funeral home, and not in New York City.\nAny memorial service should be small, modest, on Cape Cod, and managed by my son Mark.\nKurt Vonnegut\nOctober 3, 1999\nNew York City\nTO MILLER HARRIS\nDear S. Miller\u2014\nThe Sun for so many of us has been almost the only big reason we are glad to have gone to Cornell and not someplace else.
