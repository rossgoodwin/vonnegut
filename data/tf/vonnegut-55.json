He had been put in charge of his particular bus, because of his commanding vocal cords\u2014but that was pretty small stuff compared to what Father and I were doing.\nAnd Felix has made surprisingly few comments over the years on that fateful Mother\u2019s Day. Just now, though, here in Haiti, he said to me, \u201cYou know why the old man confessed?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt was the first truly consequential adventure Ufe had ever offered him. He was going to make the most of it. At last something was happening to him! He would keep it going as long as he could!\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFather really did make quite a show of it. Not only did he make an unnecessary confession, but then he took a hammer and a prybar and a chisel, and the machete I had used on the chickens, and he went clumping upstairs to the gun-room door. He himself had a key, but he didn\u2019t use it. He hacked and smashed the lock away.\nEverybody was too awed to stop him.\nAnd never, may I say, would the moment come when he would give the tiniest crumb of guilt to me. The guilt was all his, and would remain entirely, exclusively his for the rest of his life. So I was just another bleak and innocent onlooker, along with Mother and Mary Hoobler and Chief Morissey, and maybe eight small-city cops.\nHe broke all his guns, just whaled away at them in their racks with the hammer. He at least bent or dented all of them. A few old-timers shattered. What would those guns be worth today, if Felix and I had inherited them?

There were some things a lot queerer than that.\nOne was from the Francis X. Donovan Post of the American Legion in Brookline, Massachusetts, a letter in a legal-size envelope.\nAnother was a tiny newspaper rolled tight and mailed from Grand Central Station.\nI opened the newspaper first, found it to be The White Christian Minuteman, a scabrous, illiterate, anti-Semitic, anti-Negro, anti-Catholic hate sheet published by the Reverend Doctor Lionel J. D. Jones, D.D.S. \u201cSupreme Court,\u201d said the biggest headline, \u201cDemands U.S. Be Mongrel!\u201d\nThe second biggest headline said: \u201cRed Cross Gives Whites Negro Blood!\u201d\nThese headlines could hardly startle me. They were, after all, the sort of thing I had said for a living in Germany. Even closer to the spirit of the old Howard W. Campbell, Jr., actually, was the headline of a small story in one corner of the front page, a story titled: \u201cInternational Jewry Only Winners of World War II.\u201d\nI now opened the letter from the American Legion Post. It said:\nDear Howard:\nI was very surprised and disappointed to hear you weren\u2019t dead yet.

Billy Pilgrim was lying at an angle on the corner-brace, self-crucified, holding himself there with a blue and ivory claw hooked over the sill of the ventilator. Billy coughed when the door was opened, and when he coughed he shit thin gruel. This was in accordance with the Third Law of Motion according to Sir Isaac Newton. This law tells us that for every action there is a reaction which is equal and opposite in direction.\nThis can be useful in rocketry.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe train had arrived on a siding by a prison which was originally constructed as an extermination camp for Russian prisoners of war.\nThe guards peeked inside Billy\u2019s car owlishly, cooed calmingly. They had never dealt with Americans before, but they surely understood this general sort of freight. They knew that it was essentially a liquid which could be induced to flow slowly toward cooing and light. It was nighttime.\nThe only light outside came from a single bulb which hung from a pole\u2014high and far away. All was quiet outside, except for the guards, who cooed like doves. And the liquid began to flow. Gobs of it built up in the doorway, plopped to the ground.\nBilly was the next-to-last human being to reach the door. The hobo was last. The hobo could not flow, could not plop. He wasn\u2019t liquid anymore. He was stone. So it goes.\nBilly didn\u2019t want to drop from the car to the ground. He sincerely believed that he would shatter like glass. So the guards helped him down, cooing still. They set him down facing the train. It was such a dinky train now.\nThere was a locomotive, a tender, and three little boxcars. The last boxcar was the railroad guards\u2019 heaven on wheels.

Rosalia that he might be a carrier of Huntington\u2019s chorea? He revealed that terrible secret only after they had been marooned ten years, and he realized that she had been playing fast and loose with his sperm.\nOf the six guests at the El Dorado, King was acquainted with only two: *Andrew MacIntosh and his blind daughter Selena\u2014and, of course, Kazakh, Selena\u2019s dog. Anybody who knew the MacIntoshes also knew the dog, although Kazakh, thanks to surgery and training, had virtually no personality. The MacIntoshes were frequenters of several restaurants which were King\u2019s clients, and *MacIntosh, but not the dog and the daughter, had been on talk shows with some of his clients. King had watched the shows with Selena and the dog on a backstage monitor. It was his impression that the daughter had little more personality than the dog when she wasn\u2019t right next to her father. And her father was all she could talk about.\n*Andrew MacIntosh certainly enjoyed his exposure on talk shows. He was a welcome guest on them because he was so outrageous. He held forth about what fun life was if you had unlimited money to spend. He pitied and scorned people who weren\u2019t rich, and so on.\nThanks to the rigors of Santa Rosalia, Selena would develop a personality very distinct from her father\u2019s before she went down the blue tunnel into the Afterlife. She would also be fluent in Japanese. In the era of big brains, life stories could end up any which way.\nLook at mine.\nAfter Roy and Mary Hepburn, the MacIntoshes and the Hiroguchis were the next people to join the passenger list for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d That was in February. The Hiroguchis were to be *MacIntosh\u2019s guests, and they would travel under false names, so that *Zenji Hiroguchi\u2019s employers would not discover that he was negotiating a business deal with *MacIntosh.\nAs far as King and *Siegfried von Kleist and anybody else connected with the cruise knew, the Hiroguchis were the Kenzaburos, and *Zenji was a veterinarian.\nThat meant that fully half of the guests at the El Dorado weren\u2019t who they were supposed to be. As a fillip to all this big-brained deceiving going on, Mary Hepburn\u2019s war-surplus combat fatigues still bore the embroidered last name of their previous owner over the left breast pocket, which was Kaplan. And when she and James Wait finally met in the cocktail lounge, he would tell her his false name and she would tell him her true name, but he would keep calling her \u201cMrs. Kaplan\u201d anyway, and extol the Jewish people and so on.\nAnd they would later be married by the Captain on the sundeck of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, and as far as she knew, she had become the wife of Willard Flemming, and as far as he knew, he had become the husband of Mary Kaplan.\nThis sort of confusion would be impossible in the present day, since nobody has a name anymore\u2014or a profession, or a life story to tell. All that anybody has in the way of a reputation anymore is an odor which, from birth to death, cannot be modified. People are who they are, and that is that. The Law of Natural Selection has made human beings absolutely honest in that regard.

most men, massively muscled, self-made, insistently the center of any gathering, unable to relax. He had calluses on his palms as tough as the back of a crocodile. He made his living building roads, and, in his middle thirties, was growing rich at it. Legions of trucks, bulldozers, graders, earth movers, rollers, asphalt spreaders, and power shovels carried his name into every corner of the state.\nBut Earl liked owning the equipment and watching the colossal work it did more than he liked the luxuries it could earn for him. Most of his money went right back into the business, which grew bigger and bigger and bigger, with no end in sight.\nSave for good whiskey and cigars and model trains, Earl\u2019s life was Spartan. He worked with his machine operators, and dressed like them most of the time in heavy shoes and faded khaki. His house was small, and his pretty young wife, Ella, had no servants. The hobby of model railroading suited Earl perfectly\u2014the building and controlling of a busy little world complicated with wonderful machinery. And, like his business, the empire on plywood grew as though Napoleon were running it. In his imagination he could make his model railroad as real and important as affairs in the full-scale world.\n* * *\nThe brutish black 4-8-2, its big drivers clashing steel on steel, boomed over the quivering trestle and plunged into the tunnel mouth, whipping the chattering, screaming freight cars behind it. In another five seconds the locomotive, known along the pike as Old Spitfire, burst into the open again with the roar of a wounded devil.\nIt was Saturday morning, and Earl \u201cHotbox\u201d Harrison was at the throttle. His gunmetal gray eyes were slits under the visor of his striped cap. His freight was behind time, east-bound on a single track, with the westbound passenger express due. Between Old Spitfire and the safety of the siding ahead was Widow\u2019s Hairpin, the most treacherous curve on the Harrisonburg and Earl City Railroad.\nThe passenger express whistled mournfully in the distance. Hotbox gritted his teeth. There was only one thing to do. He eased the throttle wide open as Old Spitfire shot past the water tower and into the curve.\nThe track writhed under the fury of the train. Suddenly, at the peak of the curve, the locomotive tottered and shook. Hotbox cried out. The locomotive leaped free of the tracks, and the train followed its crashing, rolling course down the embankment.\nAll was still.\n\u201cDamn!\u201d said Earl. He shut off the power, left his stool, and went over to where Old Spitfire lay on its side.", 0.07873871770930595], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["chinese", 0.038461538461538464], ["eliza", 0.028846153846153848], ["father", 0.019230769230769232], ["big", 0.019230769230769232], ["wall", 0.019230769230769232], ["mother", 0.019230769230769232], ["cribs", 0.019230769230769232], ["replied", 0.009615384615384616], ["gold", 0.009615384615384616], ["half", 0.009615384615384616], ["month", 0.009615384615384616], ["swain", 0.009615384615384616], ["rooms", 0.009615384615384616], ["human", 0.009615384615384616], ["corner", 0.009615384615384616], ["perfect", 0.009615384615384616], ["parents", 0.009615384615384616], ["good", 0.009615384615384616], ["watching", 0.009615384615384616], ["read", 0.009615384615384616], ["bedrooms", 0.009615384615384616], ["fall", 0.009615384615384616], ["telling", 0.009615384615384616], ["railroad", 0.009615384615384616], ["day", 0.009615384615384616], ["rumor", 0.009615384615384616], ["elihu", 0.009615384615384616], ["turns", 0.009615384615384616], ["scientist", 0.009615384615384616], ["clothes", 0.009615384615384616], ["upper", 0.009615384615384616], ["smaller", 0.009615384615384616], ["people", 0.009615384615384616], ["frame", 0.009615384615384616], ["library", 0.009615384615384616], ["second", 0.009615384615384616], ["asleep", 0.009615384615384616], ["established", 0.009615384615384616], ["accomplish", 0.009615384615384616], ["space", 0.009615384615384616], ["health", 0.009615384615384616], ["scientists", 0.009615384615384616], ["experimenting", 0.009615384615384616], ["china", 0.009615384615384616], ["wear", 0.009615384615384616], ["news", 0.009615384615384616], ["explorers", 0.009615384615384616], ["staring", 0.009615384615384616], ["terrible", 0.009615384615384616], ["minds", 0.009615384615384616], ["thing", 0.009615384615384616], ["magazine", 0.009615384615384616], ["raised", 0.009615384615384616], ["crib", 0.009615384615384616], ["beings", 0.009615384615384616], ["bedtime", 0.009615384615384616], ["drilled", 0.009615384615384616], ["volunteered", 0.009615384615384616], ["guess", 0.009615384615384616], ["trapdoor", 0.009615384615384616], ["tiny", 0.009615384615384616], ["custom", 0.009615384615384616], ["secret", 0.009615384615384616], ["mars", 0.009615384615384616], ["panel", 0.009615384615384616], ["fire", 0.009615384615384616], ["vehicle", 0.009615384615384616], ["western", 0.009615384615384616], ["hole", 0.009615384615384616], ["eat", 0.009615384615384616], ["kind", 0.009615384615384616], ["room", 0.009615384615384616], ["hour", 0.009615384615384616], ["roosevelt", 0.009615384615384616], ["trick", 0.009615384615384616], ["supposed", 0.009615384615384616], ["servants", 0.009615384615384616], ["making", 0.009615384615384616], ["flatcars", 0.009615384615384616], ["republic", 0.009615384615384616], ["details", 0.009615384615384616], ["adjacent", 0.009615384615384616], ["emptily", 0.009615384615384616], ["separate", 0.009615384615384616], ["reunited", 0.009615384615384616], ["pretended", 0.009615384615384616], ["connected", 0.009615384615384616], ["clatter", 0.009615384615384616], ["sides", 0.009615384615384616], ["professor", 0.009615384615384616], ["looked", 0.009615384615384616], ["reputation", 0.009615384615384616], ["time", 0.009615384615384616], ["painting", 0.009615384615384616]], "sentiment": ["9\nWE WERE PUT INTO custom-made cribs\u2014in separate but adjacent bedrooms.

room, so that Dr. Robert Fender, the supply clerk and lifer, could tell us passionately how much he agreed with the song. \u201cNon!\u201d he said, his teeth gnashing, his eyes blazing. \u201cJe ne regrette rien! Rien!\u201d\nThis was, as I have already said, a veterinarian and the only American to have been convicted of treason during the Korean War. He could have been shot for what he did, since he was then a first lieutenant in the United States Army, serving in Japan and inspecting meat on its way to the troops in Korea. As a gesture of mercy, his court-martial sentenced him to life imprisonment with no chance of parole.\nThis American traitor bore a strong resemblance to a great American hero, Charles Augustus Lindbergh. He was tall and big-boned. He had Scandinavian blood. He was a farm boy. He was fairly fluent in a weepy sort of French from having listened to Edith Piaf for so long. He had actually been almost nowhere outside of prison but Ames, Iowa, and Osaka, Japan. He was so shy with women, he told me one time, that he was still a virgin when he reached Osaka. And then he fell crashingly in love with a female nightclub singer who passed herself off as Japanese and sang word-for-word imitations of Edith Piaf records. She was also a spy for North Korea.\n\u201cMy dear friend, my dear Walter Starbuck,\u201d he said, \u201cand how has this day gone for you so far?\u201d\nSo I told him about sitting on the cot and having the same song run through my head again and again, about Sally in the garden, sifting cinders.\nHe laughed. He has since put me and the incident into a science fiction story of his, which I am proud to say is appearing this very month in Playboy, a RAMJAC magazine. The author is ostensibly Frank X. Barlow. The story is about a former judge on the plane Vicuna, two and a half galaxies away from. Earth, who has had to leave his body behind and whose soul goes flying through space, looking for a habitable planet and a new body to occupy. He finds that the universe is virtually lifeless, but he comes at last to Earth and makes his first landing in the enlisted men\u2019s parking lot of Finletter Air Force Base\u2014thirty-five miles from Atlanta, Georgia. He can enter any body he likes through its ear, and ride around inside. He wants a body so he can have some sort of social life. A soul without a body, according to the story, can\u2019t have any social life\u2014because nobody can see it, and it can\u2019t touch anybody or make any noise.\nThe judge thinks he can leave a body again, any time he finds it or its destiny uncongenial. Little does he dream that the chemistries of Earthlings and Vicunians are such that, once he enters a body, he is going to be stuck inside forever. The story includes a little essay on glues previously known on Earth, and says that the strongest of these was the one that sticks mature barnacles to boulders or boats or pilings, or whatever.\n\u201cWhen they are very young,\u201d Dr. Fender writes in the persona of Frank X. Barlow, \u201cbarnacles can drift or creep whence-so-ever they hanker, anywhere in the seven seas and the brackish estuaries thereof. Their upper bodies are encased in cone-shaped armor. Their little tootsies dangle from the cones like clappers from dinnerbells.\n\u201cBut there comes a time for every barnacle, at childhood\u2019s end, when the rim of its cone secretes a glue that will stick forever to whatever it happens to touch next. So it is no casual thing on Earth to say to a pubescent barnacle or to a homeless soul from Vicuna, \u2018Sit thee doon, sit thee doon.\u2019\u201d\nThe judge from Vicuna in the story tells us that the way the people on his native planet said \u201chello\u201d and \u201cgoodbye,\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d too. It was this: \u201cting-a-ling.\u201d He says that back on Vicuna the people could don and doff their bodies as easily as Earthlings could change their clothing.

She was living in Paris with another woman. They were both teaching English and math in an American high school over there.\nMY KIDS WILL never forgive me for not putting my mother-in-law into a mental hospital instead of keeping her at home, where she was a great embarrassment to them. They couldn\u2019t bring friends home. If I had put Mildred into a nuthouse, though, I couldn\u2019t have afforded to send Melanie and Eugene Jr. to such expensive schools. I got a free house at Tarkington, but my salary was small.\nAlso, I didn\u2019t think Mildred\u2019s craziness was as unbearable as they did. In the Army I had grown used to people who talked nonsense all day long. Vietnam was 1 big hallucination. After adjusting to that, I could adjust to anything.\nWhat my children most dislike me for, though, is my reproducing in conjunction with their mother. They live in constant dread of suddenly going as batty as Mildred and Margaret. Unfortunately, there is a good chance of that.\nIRONICALLY ENOUGH, I happen to have an illegitimate son about whom I learned only recently. Since he had a different mother, he need not expect to go insane someday. Some of his kids, if he ever has any, could inherit my own mother\u2019s tendency to fatness, though.\nBut they could join Weight Watchers as Mother did.\nHEREDITY IS OBVIOUSLY much on my mind these days, and should be. So I have been reading up on it some in a book that also deals with embryology. And I tell you: People who are wary of what they might find in a book if they opened 1 are right to be. I have just had my mind blown by an essay on the embryology of the human eye.\nNo combination of Time and Luck could have produced a camera that excellent, not even if the quantity of time had been 1,000,000,000,000 years! How is that for an unsolved mystery?\nWHEN I WENT to work at Athena, I hoped to find at least 1 of the 3 convicts who had seen Mildred and Margaret and me having a picnic so long ago.

It was hauling seventy-eight thousand pounds of Spanish olives. It picked him up at the mouth of the Lincoln Tunnel, which was named in honor of a man who had had the courage and imagination to make human slavery against the law in the United States of America. This was a recent innovation.\nThe slaves were simply turned loose without any property. They were easily recognizable. They were black. They were suddenly free to go exploring.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe driver, who was white, told Trout that he would have to lie on the floor of the cab until they reached open country, since it was against the law for him to pick up hitchhikers.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was still dark when he told Trout he could sit up. They were crossing the poisoned marshes and meadows of New Jersey. The truck was a General Motors Astro-95 Diesel tractor, hooked up to a trailer forty feet long. It was so enormous that it made Trout feel that his head was about the size of a piece of bee-bee shot.\nThe driver said he used to be a hunter and a fisherman, long ago. It broke his heart when he imagined what the marshes and meadows had been like only a hundred years before. \u201cAnd when you think of the shit that most of these factories make\u2014wash day products, catfood, pop\u2014\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe had a point.
