One was the Englishman \u201cLord Haw Haw,\u201d who became a funny and interesting and ultimately terrible radio propagandist for the Nazis. His name was Joyce, and he was hanged, I think. I used to listen to him on the radio, fascinated, and to speculate about what sort of American might have done what he did. The other inspiration was a seeming American who tried to recruit American prisoners of war for the German Army, for combat on the Russian front. I met him when I was a PW in Dresden, and my guess is that he was a German actor. Still, I played with the idea of his being what he claimed to be.\nSo far as I know, there was no American turncoat on the order of England\u2019s Joyce. I knew about Pound, of course, but he wouldn\u2019t have been much use to me in Mother Night. I wanted my man to be fairly ordinary. Pound was off-scale for at least two reasons: he was cracked, and he was a world class artist. A third reason: Pound was a passionate anti-semite. He was sincere in his anti-semitism, as Campbell was not. This, in my opinion, made Campbell a more alarming war criminal than Lord Haw Haw or Pound.\nYours truly,\nKurt Vonnegut", -0.0017561983471074405], "title": "Letters"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["sheila", 0.03787878787878788], ["la", 0.022727272727272728], ["anonymous", 0.022727272727272728], ["lovers", 0.022727272727272728], ["herb", 0.022727272727272728], ["dinner", 0.022727272727272728], ["windows", 0.022727272727272728], ["founding", 0.015151515151515152], ["combination", 0.015151515151515152], ["aluminum", 0.015151515151515152], ["eating", 0.015151515151515152], ["fifteen", 0.015151515151515152], ["screens", 0.015151515151515152], ["girls", 0.015151515151515152], ["storm", 0.015151515151515152], ["room", 0.015151515151515152], ["will", 0.015151515151515152], ["heart", 0.015151515151515152], ["crazy", 0.015151515151515152], ["sunday", 0.015151515151515152], ["yesterday", 0.015151515151515152], ["ago", 0.015151515151515152], ["duty", 0.007575757575757576], ["money", 0.007575757575757576], ["month", 0.007575757575757576], ["gang", 0.007575757575757576], ["gossip", 0.007575757575757576], ["find", 0.007575757575757576], ["tire", 0.007575757575757576], ["contemplating", 0.007575757575757576], ["window", 0.007575757575757576], ["happened", 0.007575757575757576], ["coffee", 0.007575757575757576], ["good", 0.007575757575757576], ["years", 0.007575757575757576], ["dreams", 0.007575757575757576], ["habits", 0.007575757575757576], ["small", 0.007575757575757576], ["served", 0.007575757575757576], ["people", 0.007575757575757576], ["house", 0.007575757575757576], ["macaroons", 0.007575757575757576], ["battola", 0.007575757575757576], ["happen", 0.007575757575757576], ["ark", 0.007575757575757576], ["sordid", 0.007575757575757576], ["thunder", 0.007575757575757576], ["idle", 0.007575757575757576], ["bird", 0.007575757575757576], ["bought", 0.007575757575757576], ["sheilas", 0.007575757575757576], ["business", 0.007575757575757576], ["standard", 0.007575757575757576], ["broken", 0.007575757575757576], ["spare", 0.007575757575757576], ["news", 0.007575757575757576], ["wanted", 0.007575757575757576], ["piece", 0.007575757575757576], ["thirty", 0.007575757575757576], ["joke", 0.007575757575757576], ["stand", 0.007575757575757576], ["pines", 0.007575757575757576], ["spreading", 0.007575757575757576], ["hinckley", 0.007575757575757576], ["table", 0.007575757575757576], ["divorce", 0.007575757575757576], ["long", 0.007575757575757576], ["start", 0.007575757575757576], ["lot", 0.007575757575757576], ["speaking", 0.007575757575757576], ["life", 0.007575757575757576], ["lived", 0.007575757575757576], ["families", 0.007575757575757576], ["fund", 0.007575757575757576], ["accident", 0.007575757575757576], ["towns", 0.007575757575757576], ["eat", 0.007575757575757576], ["town", 0.007575757575757576], ["join", 0.007575757575757576], ["weren", 0.007575757575757576], ["suppose", 0.007575757575757576], ["lover", 0.007575757575757576], ["bathtub", 0.007575757575757576], ["called", 0.007575757575757576], ["collecting", 0.007575757575757576], ["ages", 0.007575757575757576], ["buy", 0.007575757575757576], ["fashioned", 0.007575757575757576], ["things", 0.007575757575757576], ["enclosure", 0.007575757575757576], ["wrong", 0.007575757575757576], ["whitewall", 0.007575757575757576], ["plumber", 0.007575757575757576], ["wife", 0.007575757575757576], ["thought", 0.007575757575757576], ["chief", 0.007575757575757576], ["time", 0.007575757575757576], ["fleetwood", 0.007575757575757576], ["order", 0.007575757575757576], ["fact", 0.007575757575757576], ["laws", 0.007575757575757576]], "sentiment": ["And like a lot of crazy things in small, old-fashioned towns, Lovers Anonymous lived on and on.

But as Will Battola, the plumber, said one time, \u201cSheila Hinckley is now a spare whitewall tire on the Thunder-bird of my dreams.\u201d\nThen about a month ago my good wife served a sordid little piece of news along with the after-dinner coffee and macaroons. She said that Herb and Sheila weren\u2019t speaking to each other anymore.\n\u201cNow, what are you doing spreading idle gossip like that for?\u201d I said.\n\u201cI thought it was my duty to tell you,\u201d she said, \u201csince you\u2019re the lover-in-chief of Lovers Anonymous.\u201d\n\u201cI was merely present at the founding,\u201d I said, \u201cand as you well know, that was many, many years ago.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I think you can start un-founding,\u201d she said.\n\u201cLook,\u201d I said, \u201cthere aren\u2019t many laws of life that stand up through the ages, but this is one of the few: People who are contemplating divorce do not buy combination aluminum storm windows and screens for a fifteen-room house.\u201d That is my business\u2014combination aluminum storm windows and screens, and here and there a bathtub enclosure. And it was a fact that very recently Herb had bought thirty-seven Fleetwood windows, which is our first-line window, for the fifteen-room ark he called home.\n\u201cFamilies that don\u2019t even eat together don\u2019t keep together very long,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat do you know about their eating habits?\u201d I wanted to know.\n\u201cNothing I didn\u2019t find out by accident,\u201d she said. \u201cI was collecting money for the Heart Fund yesterday.\u201d Yesterday was Sunday. \u201cI happened to get there just when they were having Sunday dinner, and there were the girls and Sheila at the dinner table, eating\u2014and no Herb.\u201d", 0.05231481481481481], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["better", 0.03389830508474576], ["men", 0.03389830508474576], ["protoplasm", 0.03389830508474576], ["epicac", 0.03389830508474576], ["153", 0.01694915254237288], ["887", 0.01694915254237288], ["hoping", 0.01694915254237288], ["lied", 0.01694915254237288], ["imposing", 0.01694915254237288], ["perspiring", 0.01694915254237288], ["indestructible", 0.01694915254237288], ["limply", 0.01694915254237288], ["course", 0.01694915254237288], ["276", 0.01694915254237288], ["poetry", 0.01694915254237288], ["times", 0.01694915254237288], ["fireproof", 0.01694915254237288], ["machines", 0.01694915254237288], ["ground", 0.01694915254237288], ["defensively", 0.01694915254237288], ["pause", 0.01694915254237288], ["clicked", 0.01694915254237288], ["879", 0.01694915254237288], ["fingers", 0.01694915254237288], ["long", 0.01694915254237288], ["574", 0.01694915254237288], ["345", 0.01694915254237288], ["tape", 0.01694915254237288], ["typed", 0.01694915254237288], ["recorder", 0.01694915254237288], ["985", 0.01694915254237288], ["magnetic", 0.01694915254237288], ["memory", 0.01694915254237288], ["exactly", 0.01694915254237288], ["love", 0.01694915254237288], ["desperately", 0.01694915254237288], ["keys", 0.01694915254237288], ["smarter", 0.01694915254237288], ["metal", 0.01694915254237288], ["lasts", 0.01694915254237288], ["glass", 0.01694915254237288], ["rested", 0.01694915254237288], ["007", 0.01694915254237288], ["049", 0.01694915254237288], ["coming", 0.01694915254237288], ["difference", 0.01694915254237288], ["women", 0.01694915254237288], ["forever", 0.01694915254237288], ["word", 0.01694915254237288], ["bluff", 0.01694915254237288], ["freely", 0.01694915254237288], ["seconds", 0.01694915254237288], ["34", 0.01694915254237288], ["write", 0.01694915254237288], ["821", 0.01694915254237288]], "sentiment": ["\"What\u2019s the difference, exactly?
