We can have an olympic pool almost all to ourselves on weekday mornings. It\u2019s nice and warm.\nI got you a sensational birthday present, so you really must come soon. There are a couple of parties over the weekend of the 29th, so you\u2019ll get to meet my colleagues and their wives under cheerful and easy circumstances, Algren, Starbuck, Bourjaily, Donoso. Donoso is particularly neat. He is probably the greatest living Chilean novelist. Algren told him: \u201cI always thought it would be fun to belong to a country that skinny.\u201d [\u2026]\nI gave my thesis to a thesis-typer around here named Mrs. Meek. She is, according to the schedule, four days away from having her second baby. I can believe it. She said I would get my thesis back either right before or right after the baby. She says that having babies makes her feel marvelous, makes her work even harder right before and right after. She\u2019s a lot like you in that respect.\nThis place is full of the dumbest, sweetest mice. I haven\u2019t the heart to harm them\u2014and neither will Edith, and neither will you.

"sentiment": ["A safer place than a helicopter aloft is a roller coaster or a Ferris wheel.\nYes, and when martial law was established in New York City, the former Museum of the American Indian was turned into a barracks, and Kilgore Trout was relieved of his bazooka, and the Academy\u2019s headquarters were requisitioned as an officers\u2019 club, and he and Monica Pepper and Dudley Prince and Jerry Rivers took off in the limousine for Xanadu.\nTrout, the former hobo, had expensive clothing, including shoes and socks and underwear and cuff links, and matched Louis Vuitton luggage which had belonged to Zoltan Pepper. Everybody agreed that Monica\u2019s husband was better off dead. What would he have had to look forward to?\nWhen Trout found Zoltan\u2019s flattened and elongated wheelchair in the middle of West 155th Street, he leaned it against a tree and said it was modern art. The two wheels had been squashed together so they looked like one. Trout said it was a six-foot aluminum-and-leather praying mantis, trying to ride a unicycle.\nHe called it The Spirit of the Twenty-first Century.\n55\nI met the author Dick Francis at the Kentucky Derby years ago. I knew he had been a champion rider in steeplechases. I said he was a bigger man than I had expected. He replied that it took a big man to \u201chold a horse together\u201d in a steeplechase. This image of his remained in the forefront of my memory so long, I think, because life itself can seem a lot like that: a matter of holding one\u2019s self-respect together, instead of a horse, as one\u2019s self-respect is expected to hurdle fences and hedges and water.\nMy dear thirteen-year-old daughter Lily, having become a pretty adolescent, appears to me, as do most American adolescents, to be holding her self-respect together the best she can in a really scary steeplechase.\nI said to the new graduates at Butler University, not much older than Lily, that they were being called Generation X, two clicks from the end, but that they were as much Generation A as Adam and Eve had been. What malarkey!\nEsprit de l\u2019escalier! Better late than never! Only at this very moment in 1996, as I am about to write the next sentence, have I realized how meaningless the image of a Garden of Eden must have been to my young audience, since the world was so densely populated with other secretly frightened people, and so overplanted and rigged with both natural and manmade booby traps.", 0.03036042240587695], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["ying", 0.032], ["pi", 0.032], ["kelly", 0.032], ["going", 0.024], ["news", 0.024], ["voice", 0.024], ["kill", 0.016], ["shrugged", 0.016], ["better", 0.016], ["game", 0.016], ["bad", 0.016], ["sergeant", 0.016], ["lives", 0.016], ["pilot", 0.016], ["states", 0.016], ["united", 0.016], ["play", 0.016], ["wife", 0.016], ["average", 0.016], ["looked", 0.008], ["bring", 0.008], ["cold", 0.008], ["children", 0.008], ["young", 0.008], ["youngster", 0.008], ["snap", 0.008], ["limp", 0.008], ["boom", 0.008], ["borrowed", 0.008], ["wouldn", 0.008], ["good", 0.008], ["smarter", 0.008], ["bear", 0.008], ["courage", 0.008], ["worst", 0.008], ["hands", 0.008], ["dare", 0.008], ["shoulder", 0.008], ["man", 0.008], ["lose", 0.008], ["upstairs", 0.008], ["waking", 0.008], ["fist", 0.008], ["transport", 0.008], ["stood", 0.008], ["entertainment", 0.008], ["colonel", 0.008], ["fingers", 0.008], ["rotten", 0.008], ["closed", 0.008], ["shut", 0.008], ["dejection", 0.008], ["prove", 0.008], ["thing", 0.008], ["loudly", 0.008], ["trumps", 0.008], ["pockets", 0.008], ["expression", 0.008], ["asked", 0.008], ["smiled", 0.008], ["prisoners", 0.008], ["reassure", 0.008], ["wasn", 0.008], ["carry", 0.008], ["considers", 0.008], ["corporal", 0.008], ["wrath", 0.008], ["army", 0.008], ["threatening", 0.008], ["dug", 0.008], ["brusqueness", 0.008], ["irrelevantly", 0.008], ["eyes", 0.008], ["sore", 0.008], ["shoot", 0.008], ["wide", 0.008], ["outlaw", 0.008], ["bargain", 0.008], ["war", 0.008], ["will", 0.008], ["supposed", 0.008], ["paused", 0.008], ["suspense", 0.008], ["shooting", 0.008], ["sir", 0.008], ["provide", 0.008], ["nuts", 0.008], ["chess", 0.008], ["hand", 0.008], ["margaret", 0.008], ["chance", 0.008], ["curiosity", 0.008], ["stroked", 0.008], ["face", 0.008], ["thought", 0.008], ["explosively", 0.008], ["wryly", 0.008]], "sentiment": ["\"Shut up.\" The sergeant paused. \"What about it, sir\u2014 good news or bad?\"\nKelly stroked his wife\u2019s shoulder, trying to make the right words come\u2014words to carry courage he wasn\u2019t sure he had. \"Bad news,\" he said at last. \"Rotten news.\"\n\"Well, let\u2019s have it,\" said the transport pilot loudly.

And, as they were leaving the packaging department, young Chrono picked up one of the four-inch pieces and slipped it into his pocket. The piece he picked up differed from all the rest in having two holes drilled in it.\nThis was Chrono\u2019s good-luck piece. It became as much a part of him as his right hand. His nervous system, so to speak, extended itself into the metal strap. Touch it and you touched Chrono.\nUnk, the deserter, stood up behind his turquoise boulder, walked vigorously and officiously into the school yard. He had stripped his uniform of all insignia. This gave him a rather official, warlike look, without binding him to any particular enterprise. Of all the equipment he had been carrying before he deserted, he retained only a jungle knife, his single-shot Mauser, and one grenade. These three weapons he left cached behind the boulder, along with the stolen bicycle.\nUnk marched up to Miss Fenstermaker. He told her that he wished to interview young Chrono on official business at once\u2014privately. He did not tell her that he was the boy\u2019s father. Being the boy\u2019s father entitled him to nothing. Being an official investigator entitled him to anything he might care to ask for.\nPoor Miss Fenstermaker was easily fooled. She agreed to let Unk interview the boy in her own office.\nHer office was crammed with ungraded school papers, some of them dating back five years. She was far behind in her work\u2014so far behind that she had declared a moratorium on school work until she could catch up on her grading. Some of the stacks of papers had tumbled, forming glaciers that sent fingers under her desk, into the hallway, and into her private lavatory.\nThere was an open, two-drawer filing cabinet filled with her rock collection.\nNobody ever checked up on Miss Fenstermaker. Nobody cared. She had a teaching certificate from the State of Minnesota, U.S.A., Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, and that was all that mattered.\nFor his interview with his son, Unk sat behind her desk while his son Chrono stood before him.

And I wonder now if that isn\u2019t a secret ingredient in the attitudes of so many people here, citizens or not: that this is still a virgin continent, and that everybody else is an Indian who does not appreciate its value, or is at least too weak and ignorant to defend himself?\nThe darkest secret of this country, I am afraid, is that too many of its citizens imagine that they belong to a much higher civilization somewhere else. That higher civilization doesn\u2019t have to be another country. It can be the past instead\u2014the United States as it was before it was spoiled by immigrants and the enfranchisement of the blacks.\nThis state of mind allows too many of us to He and cheat and steal from the rest of us, to sell us junk and addictive poisons and corrupting entertainments. What are the rest of us, after all, but sub-human aborigines?\nThis state of mind explains a lot of American funeral customs, too. The message of so many obsequies here, if you think about it, is this: that the dead person has looted this alien continent, and is now returning to his or her real home with the gold of El Dorado.\nBut back to 1936 again! Listen:\nMarilee\u2019s and my non-epiphany was soon over. We used it well. Each of us gripped the other\u2019s upper arms, and palpated what there was to palpate there, initiating, I suppose, an exploration from the very beginning of what sorts of devices we might be. There was warm, rubbery stuff over rods of some kind.\nBut then we heard the big front door open and close downstairs. As Terry Kitchen once said of a postcoital experience of his own: \u201cThe epiphany came back, and everybody had to put on their clothes and run around again like chickens with their heads cut off.\u201d\nAs Marilee and I were dressing, I whispered to her that I loved her with all my heart.

The man at the controls of the Galaxie was a traveling salesman for a device which engulfed the rear ends of trucks at loading docks. It was a telescoping tunnel of rubberized canvas, and it looked like this in action:\nThe idea of the gadget was to allow people in a building to load or unload trucks without losing cold air in the summertime or hot air in the wintertime to the out-of-doors.\nThe man in control of the Galaxie also sold large spools for wire and cable and rope. He also sold fire extinguishers. He was a manufacturer\u2019s representative, he explained. He was his own boss, in that he represented products whose manufacturers couldn\u2019t afford salesmen of their own.\n\u201cI make my own hours, and I pick the products I sell. The products don\u2019t sell me,\u201d he said. His name was Andy Lieber. He was thirty-two. He was white. He was a good deal overweight like so many people in the country. He was obviously a happy man. He drove like a maniac. The Galaxie was going ninety-two miles an hour now. \u201cI\u2019m one of the few remaining free men in America,\u201d he said.\nHe had a penis one inch in diameter and seven and a half inches long. During the past year, he had averaged twenty-two orgasms per month. This was far above the national average. His income and the value of his life insurance policies at maturity were also far above average.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.12764502164502164], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"},

of them, save Captain Donnini, veterans of years of fighting in the same armored division from which Major Evans had come. They behaved like conquerors, with Major Evans encouraging them to do just that. I\u2019d expected a great deal of the coming of the Americans\u2014a rebirth of pride and dignity for Marta and me; a little prosperity and good things to eat, too; and for Marta, the better part of a lifetime worth living. Instead, there was the bullying distrust of Major Evans, the new commandant, multiplied a hundred times in the persons of his men.\nIn the nightmare of a warring world, it takes peculiar skills to get along. One of these is the understanding of the psychology of occupation troops. The Russians weren\u2019t like the Nazis, and the Americans were very different from either. There wasn\u2019t the physical violence of the Russians and Nazis, thank God\u2014no shootings or torture. What was particularly interesting was that the Americans had to get drunk before they could make real trouble. Unfortunately for Beda, Major Evans let them get drunk as often as they liked. When they were drunk, they were fond of stealing\u2014in the name of souvenir hunting\u2014driving jeeps through the street at breakneck speeds, firing guns in the air, shouting obscenities, picking fistfights, and breaking windows.\nThe people of Beda were so used to keeping silent and out of sight, no matter what happened, that it took us a while to discover the really basic difference between the Americans and the others. The Americans\u2019 toughness, callousness, was very shallow, and beneath it was grave misgiving. We discovered that they could be embarrassed easily by women or older men who would stand up to them like parents, and scold them for what they were doing. This sobered most of them up as quickly as buckets of cold water would have.\nWith that insight into our conquerors, we were able to make things a little more bearable, but not much. There was the crushing realization that we were regarded as the enemy, little different from the Russians, and that the major wanted us punished. The townspeople were organized into labor battalions, and put to work under armed guard, like prisoners of war. What made the labor particularly deadly is that it wasn\u2019t concerned with repairing the war damage to the town so much as with making the American garrison\u2019s quarters more comfortable, and with building a huge and ugly monument honoring the Americans who had died in the battle for Beda. Four had died. Major Evans made the atmosphere of the town the atmosphere of a prison. Shame was the order of the day, and budding pride or hope was promptly nipped. We weren\u2019t entitled to them.\nThere was one bright spot\u2014an American unhappier than any of us\u2014Captain Donnini. It was up to him to carry out the major\u2019s orders, and getting drunk, which he tried several times, didn\u2019t do for him what it did for the others. He carried out the orders with a reluctance I\u2019m sure he could have been court-martialed for. Moreover, he spent as much time with Marta and me as he did with the major, and most of his talk with us was a guarded apology for what he had to do. Curiously, Marta and I found ourselves comforting this sad, dark giant, rather than the other way around.\nI thought about the major as I stood at my workbench in the back room, finishing up the American eagle for the front of the new commandant\u2019s desk. Marta lay on my cot, staring at the ceiling. Her shoes were white with rock dust. She had been working all day on the monument.\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said gloomily, \u201cif I\u2019d been fighting for three years, I wonder how friendly I would be. Let\u2019s face it, whether all of us wanted to or not, we gave men and materials that helped to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans.\u201d I gestured at the mountains to the west. \u201cLook where the Russians got their uranium.\u201d\n\u201cEye for eye, tooth for tooth,\u201d said Marta. \u201cHow long does that go on?\u201d\nI sighed and shook my head. \u201cThe Czechs have paid with interest, God knows. Hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\u201d We\u2019d lost most of our young men, Marta\u2019s husband among them, in suicide waves before main Russian attacks; and our largest cities were little more than gravel and smoke.", 0.06544667453758364], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
