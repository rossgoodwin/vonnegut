If you heard this idea, I think you would agree that it would be a sensational teen-ager fad for a few wild, lucrative weeks.\nDoes this sort of thing interest you? The tie would cost virtually nothing to make\u2014no mechanical gadgets, no wires, no electronic tubes. It\u2019s just a plain, ordinary bowtie (no, it doesn\u2019t glow in the dark, dammit), put together like any other bowtie. But there is one thing about it that would make it a natural for promotion.\nAre you interested? If you are, and if the idea is any good, how will you reward me?\nYou don\u2019t discourage me about writing. I have a pitch, which I think will pay off. I have no scruples about selling to slicks. I would be very content if I could do it consistently. I hope to build a reputation as a science-fiction writer. That\u2019s the pitch. We\u2019ll see.\nThis tie item is a very hot one. If you\u2019re a man of any enterprise and bowtie manufacturing facilities, you\u2019ll be wise to write at once for details, samples, etc.\nWhat kind of shirts do you make? Can you give me a factory price on some blue, oxford cloth, button-down, 15\u201335\u2019s?\nDoubleday wants me to expand \u201cBarnhouse\u201d into a full novel.

I\u2019m a joke, an old fool who can\u2019t forget for a minute that he was a general. Maybe it was your father who taught you that.\u201d\n\u201cHardly, sir,\u201d said Haley, embarrassed, but at a loss as to how he might argue the point.\n\u201cGood\u2014the cards are on the table,\u201d said the General. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t figured out for yourselves just what I think of you, I\u2019ll clear that up, too. First of all, I\u2019m fond of you both. I think you\u2019re too soft and spoiled for your own good. I want you to be happy, and I get no fun at all out of hurting you. But you\u2019re still children, and I\u2019m supposed to take care of you to the best of my ability. If I can teach you one simple lesson, I\u2019ll have done a good job of it. You\u2019re evidently going to have to learn the hard way that your happiness for the rest of your lives depends on how well you fit yourselves into other people\u2019s plans, not vice versa, and on how willing you are to submit to the judgment of someone who knows more than you do. Am I right or wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d faltered Hope.\n\u201cYessir,\u201d said Haley. The lesson sounded like an eminently reasonable one, easily committed to memory.\n\u201cWhat you have done tonight has hurt, not helped, all of us,\u201d said the General, \u201cand poor, harebrained Kitty most of all. You\u2019ll see. Because you helped her run away with that crude, asinine chimpanzee, she is in for nothing but grief. We\u2019ll get her back, because she\u2019s too young to marry without my say so, but she\u2019ll never be the same again\u2014because you didn\u2019t have the good sense to stop her. Am I right or wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d moaned Haley. Hope remained silent.\n\u201cDo you feel I have stated the situation fairly, and that you have done something quite bad?\u201d asked the General, his eyebrows arched.\nHaley and Hope nodded.\n\u201cVery well, then, some kind of punishment is in order. Hope, Annie and I have decided that you should be sent away to some boarding school. I\u2019ll look into the matter tomorrow, and I\u2019ll pick one where you\u2019ll be watched carefully and kept in line. I think one of your big troubles has been the smart-aleck company you\u2019ve been keeping at the high school.\u201d", 0.19126293995859212], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training":

Mr. Banghart was hesitant. At last he handed it over, admonishing him to be careful. \u201cIt\u2019d take your arm off quicker than you could say \u2018Jack Robinson,\u2019\u201d he said proudly. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one I\u2019d ever let look at it except Hope,\u201d he added. He shook his head mournfully. \u201cA fellow\u2019s in pretty sad shape when he can only trust two people, isn\u2019t he, now?\u201d\nHaley nodded, and found himself wondering who it was that he could trust. Everyone seemed intent on worrying him into a pattern of their own making, rather than trying to understand what it might be like to be Haley Brandon. He wondered most about Hope. With discomfiting insight, he recognized that any attention she might have shown him was probably a subtle defiance of her father. \u201cLike protecting Caesar and Delores from him,\u201d he thought ruefully.\nWhen they set about flinging bales onto the wagon, the circle of Haley\u2019s thoughts grew smaller, with limits set at the hard work on hand. He was pleased to see that he was accomplishing nearly as much as Mr. Banghart. It was more a matter of rhythm than strength \u2014 swinging the bales several times, then giving them a hearty boost with a knee on their upward arcs. True, when the load was three bales high, pitches more hefty than Haley\u2019s were called for, but he was able to make himself useful by sitting atop the load, and pulling the bales into place as Mr. Banghart tossed them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a load!\u201d he cried, when the fifth tier was complete.\nMr. Banghart shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll stack her seven high and save time,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be above the stakes,\u201d Haley warned.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it a million times,\u201d said Mr. Banghart. \u201cNothing to it. Just drive easy, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nHaley looked dubiously at the horses, who were keeping their harness taut and clinking with their restlessness. In a few minutes he was seated uneasily on a swaying load seven bales high, with Mr. Banghart beside him, singing, and preparing to start the team for the barn. He peered over the edge of the bales at the ground and had the chilly impression of being perched on a steep cliff overlooking a gorge miles below.\nAt Mr. Banghart\u2019s soft clucking, Caesar and Delores started off evenly and good-naturedly. The bales rocked as the wheels struck rocks and pits in the lane, but not one had dropped off when the wagon rolled at last onto the hard-packed earth of the barnyard near the house. Mr. Banghart had looked at the Sun and guessed that the time was between 8 and 9 o\u2019clock. Haley noted that the General was no longer abed, for his beloved automobile, immaculate and glistening as a thousand-dollar casket, was out of the garage and parked in the driveway near the kitchen door. No one was outside.\nSuddenly the bales beneath Haley gave a great heave, and he felt himself hurtling downward, with Mr. Banghart shouting in mid-air beside him. The whack of his chest against the earth stunned away his breath and senses. When he regained them, it was in time to roll out of the way of Caesar and Delores, who had made a full circle in the barnyard, and now bore down upon him with fury. The emptied wagon clattered behind them, its steel-bound wheels screeching on dry bearings and striking sparks from rocks as it came. The team turned into the driveway at a full run. The wagon shot a spray of gravel rattling against the back of the house, and its right wheels skidded into a shallow ditch to set it careening at a crazy angle.", 0.12273387369132048], "title": "Basic

had every piece of equipment he had ever been issued, every present he\u2019d received from home: helmet, helmet liner, wool cap, scarf, gloves, cotton undershirt, woolen undershirt, wool shirt, sweater, blouse, jacket, overcoat, cotton underpants, woolen underpants, woolen trousers, cotton socks, woolen socks, combat boots, gas mask, canteen, mess kit, first-aid kit, trench knife, blanket, shelter-half, raincoat, bulletproof Bible, a pamphlet entitled \u201cKnow Your Enemy,\u201d another pamphlet entitled \u201cWhy We Fight,\u201d and another pamphlet of German phrases rendered in English phonetics, which would enable Weary to ask Germans questions such as \u201cWhere is your headquarters?\u201d and \u201cHow many howitzers have you?\u201d or to tell them, \u201cSurrender. Your situation is hopeless,\u201d and so on.\nWeary had a block of balsa wood which was supposed to be a foxhole pillow. He had a prophylactic kit containing two tough condoms \u201cFor the Prevention of Disease Only!\u201d He had a whistle he wasn\u2019t going to show anybody until he got promoted to corporal. He had a dirty picture of a woman attempting sexual intercourse with a Shetland pony. He had made Billy Pilgrim admire that picture several times.\nThe woman and the pony were posed before velvet draperies which were fringed with deedlee-balls. They were flanked by Doric columns. In front of one column was a potted palm. The picture that Weary had was a print of the first dirty photograph in history. The word photography was first used in 1839, and it was in that year, too, that Louis J. M. Daguerre revealed to the French Academy that an image formed on a silvered metal plate covered with a thin film of silver iodide could be developed in the presence of mercury vapor.\nIn 1841, only two years later, an assistant to Daguerre, Andr\u00e9 Le F\u00e8vre, was arrested in the Tuileries Gardens for attempting to sell a gentleman a picture of the woman and the pony. That was where Weary bought his picture, too\u2014in the Tuileries. Le F\u00e8vre argued that the picture was fine art, and that his intention was to make Greek mythology come alive. He said the columns and the potted palm proved that.\nWhen asked which myth he meant to represent, Le F\u00e8vre replied that there were thousands of myths like that, with the woman a mortal and the pony a god.\nHe was sentenced to six months in prison. He died there of pneumonia. So it goes.\nBilly and the scouts were skinny people. Roland Weary had fat to burn. He was a roaring furnace under all his layers of wool and straps and canvas. He had so much energy that he bustled back and forth between Billy and the scouts, delivering dumb messages which nobody had sent and which nobody was pleased to receive. He also began to suspect, since he was so much busier than anybody else, that he was the leader.\nHe was so hot and bundled up, in fact, that he had no sense of danger. His vision of the outside world was limited to what he could see through a narrow slit between the rim of his helmet and his scarf from home, which concealed his baby face from the bridge of his nose on down. He was so snug in there that he was able to pretend that he was safe at home, having survived the war, and that he was telling his parents and his sister a true war story\u2014whereas the true war story was still going on.\nWeary\u2019s version of the true war story went like this: There was a big German attack, and Weary and his antitank buddies fought like hell until everybody was killed but Weary. So it goes. And then Weary tied in with two scouts, and they became close friends immediately, and they decided to fight their way back to their own lines. They were going to travel fast. They were damned if they\u2019d surrender. They shook hands all around. They called themselves \u201cThe Three Musketeers.\u201d\nBut then this damn college kid, who was so weak he shouldn\u2019t even have been in the army, asked if he could come along. He didn\u2019t even have a gun or a knife. He didn\u2019t even have a helmet or a cap. He couldn\u2019t even walk right\u2014kept bobbing up-and-down, up-and-down, driving everybody crazy, giving their position away. He was pitiful. The Three Musketeers pushed and carried and dragged the college kid all the way back to their own lines, Weary\u2019s story went.

not important to my story, but his only sibling, his brother Adolf, three years his senior and also a bachelor, surely is. Adolf von Kleist, the Captain of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, would in fact become the ancestor of every human being on the face of the earth today.\nWith the help of Mary Hepburn, he would become a latter-day Adam, so to speak. The biology teacher from Ilium, however, since she had ceased ovulating, would not, could not, become his Eve. So she had to be more like a god instead.\nAnd this supremely important brother of the insignificant hotel manager was at that moment arriving at Guayaquil International Airport on a nearly empty transport plane from New York City, where he had been doing publicity for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d\nIf Mary had listened in on the Hiroguchis through her closet wall, she wouldn\u2019t have understood what was troubling them, since their susurruses were in Japanese, the only language in which they were fluent. *Zenji knew a little English and Russian. Hisako knew a little Chinese. Neither one knew any Spanish or Quechuan or German or Portuguese, the commonest languages in Ecuador.\nThey, too, it turned out, were bitter about what their supposedly wonderful brains had done to them. They felt especially foolish about having allowed themselves to be delivered into such a nightmare, since *Zenji was widely regarded as being one of the smartest men in the world. And it was his fault, not hers, that they had in effect become prisoners of the dynamic *Andrew MacIntosh.\nHere is how that happened: *MacIntosh had visited Japan with his blind daughter and her dog about a year before, and had met *Zenji, and had seen the wonderful work he was doing as a salaried employee for Matsumoto. Technologically speaking, *Zenji, although only twenty-nine, had become a grandfather. He had earlier sired a pocket computer capable of translating many spoken languages instantaneously, and he had named it \u201cGokubi.\u201d And then, at the time of the MacIntoshes\u2019 visit to Japan, *Zenji had come up with a pilot model for a new generation of simultaneous voice translators, and he had named it \u201cMandarax.\u201d\nSo *Andrew MacIntosh, whose investment banking firm raised money for businesses and itself by the sale of stocks and bonds, took young *Zenji aside and told him that he was an idiot to be on salary, that *MacIntosh could help him form a corporation of his own which would make him almost instantly a billionaire in dollars or a trillionaire in yen.\nSo *Zenji said that he would like time to think about it.\nThis exploratory conversation took place in a Tokyo sushi restaurant. Sushi was raw fish wrapped around cold rice, a popular dish a million years ago. Little did anybody dream back then that everybody would be eating practically nothing but raw fish in the sweet by-and-by.\nThe florid, boisterous American entrepreneur and the reserved, relatively doll-like Japanese inventor communicated through Gokubi, since neither spoke the other\u2019s language at all well. There were then thousands upon thousands of Gokubis in use all over the world. The two men could not use Mandarax, since the only working model of Mandarax was under heavy guard in *Zenji\u2019s office back at Matsumoto. So *Zenji\u2019s big brain began to play with the idea of becoming as rich as the richest man in his country, who was the Emperor of Japan.", 0.07497429041546688], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard":

It is a very long and narrow structure without windows, with sliding doors and a potbellied stove at either end, built for the storage of potatoes and nothing else. The idea was this: a farmer might maintain an even temperature in there, no matter what the weather, with the stoves and the doors, so that his potatoes would neither freeze nor sprout until he was ready to market them.\nIt was structures with such unusual dimensions, in fact, along with what used to be very cheap property, which caused many painters to move out here when I was young, and especially painters who were working on exceptionally large canvases. I would never have been able to work on the eight panels comprising \u201cWindsor Blue Number Seventeen\u201d as a single piece, if I hadn\u2019t rented that potato barn.\nThe nosy widow Berman, a.k.a. \u201cPolly Madison,\u201d can\u2019t get into the studio or even take a peek inside because it has no windows and because two years ago, right after my wife died, I personally nailed the doors at one end shut from the inside with six-inch spikes, and immobilized the doors at the other end on the outside, from top to bottom, with six big padlocks and massive hasps.\nI myself haven\u2019t been in there since. And, yes, there is something in there. This is no shaggy dog story. After I die and am buried next to my darling Edith, and the executors of my estate open those doors at last, they will find more than just thin air in there. And it won\u2019t be some pathetic symbol, such as a paintbrush broken in two or my Purple Heart on an otherwise vacant and clean-swept floor.\nAnd there is no lame joke in there, like a painting of potatoes, as though I were returning the barn to potatoes, or a painting of the Virgin Mary wearing a derby and holding a watermelon, or some such thing.\nAnd no self-portrait.\nAnd nothing with a religious message.\nTantalizing? Here\u2019s a hint: it\u2019s bigger than a bread box and smaller than the planet Jupiter.\nNot even Paul Slazinger has come close to guessing what is in there, and he has said more than once that he doesn\u2019t see how our friendship can continue, if I feel my secret would not be safe with him.\nThe barn has become quite famous in the art world. After I show visitors the collection in the house, most of them ask if they can see what is in the barn as well. I tell them that they can see the outside of the barn, if they like, and that the outside is in fact a significant landmark in art history. The first time Terry Kitchen used a paint-spraying rig, his target was an old piece of beaverboard he had leaned against the barn.", 0.08915282392026579], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "a-man-without-a-country": {"tfidf": [["humanists", 0.05263157894736842], ["isaac", 0.02631578947368421], ["good", 0.02631578947368421], ["humanist", 0.02631578947368421], ["years", 0.017543859649122806], ["human", 0.017543859649122806], ["parents", 0.017543859649122806], ["heaven", 0.017543859649122806], ["god", 0.017543859649122806], ["grandparents", 0.017543859649122806], ["thing", 0.017543859649122806], ["jesus", 0.017543859649122806], ["bad", 0.008771929824561403], ["hadn", 0.008771929824561403], ["honoring", 0.008771929824561403], ["writer", 0.008771929824561403], ["late", 0.008771929824561403], ["feel", 0.008771929824561403], ["hope", 0.008771929824561403], ["real", 0.008771929824561403], ["wouldn", 0.008771929824561403], ["expectation", 0.008771929824561403], ["association", 0.008771929824561403], ["die", 0.008771929824561403], ["brother", 0.008771929824561403], ["audience", 0.008771929824561403], ["thinkers", 0.008771929824561403], ["absolutely", 0.008771929824561403], ["alive", 0.008771929824561403], ["books", 0.008771929824561403], ["incidentally", 0.008771929824561403], ["best", 0.008771929824561403], ["delivered", 0.008771929824561403], ["capacity", 0.008771929824561403], ["honorably", 0.008771929824561403], ["familiarity", 0.008771929824561403], ["rattlesnake", 0.008771929824561403], ["behave", 0.008771929824561403], ["hitler", 0.008771929824561403], ["rolled", 0.008771929824561403], ["free", 0.008771929824561403], ["enthralling", 0.008771929824561403], ["punishments", 0.008771929824561403], ["pity", 0.008771929824561403], ["great", 0.008771929824561403], ["bible", 0.008771929824561403], ["asimov", 0.008771929824561403], ["joke", 0.008771929824561403], ["favorite", 0.008771929824561403], ["guessers", 0.008771929824561403], ["american", 0.008771929824561403], ["point", 0.008771929824561403], ["forbid", 0.008771929824561403], ["community", 0.008771929824561403], ["beings", 0.008771929824561403], ["president", 0.008771929824561403], ["message", 0.008771929824561403], ["sermon", 0.008771929824561403], ["guess", 0.008771929824561403], ["spoke", 0.008771929824561403], ["service", 0.008771929824561403], ["leading", 0.008771929824561403], ["fiction", 0.008771929824561403], ["terrifying", 0.008771929824561403], ["rewards", 0.008771929824561403], ["honorary", 0.008771929824561403], ["serve", 0.008771929824561403], ["sister", 0.008771929824561403], ["mercy", 0.008771929824561403], ["science", 0.008771929824561403], ["mount", 0.008771929824561403], ["will", 0.008771929824561403], ["matter", 0.008771929824561403], ["minutes", 0.008771929824561403], ["called", 0.008771929824561403], ["history", 0.008771929824561403], ["beautiful", 0.008771929824561403], ["guesser", 0.008771929824561403], ["aristotle", 0.008771929824561403], ["memorial", 0.008771929824561403], ["ancestors", 0.008771929824561403], ["afterlife", 0.008771929824561403], ["fairly", 0.008771929824561403], ["abstraction", 0.008771929824561403], ["decently", 0.008771929824561403], ["characters", 0.008771929824561403], ["aisles", 0.008771929824561403], ["totally", 0.008771929824561403], ["christ", 0.008771929824561403], ["succeeded", 0.008771929824561403], ["funniest", 0.008771929824561403], ["functionless", 0.008771929824561403], ["kurt", 0.008771929824561403], ["order", 0.008771929824561403], ["restored", 0.008771929824561403]], "sentiment": ["Do you know what a humanist is?\nMy parents and grandparents were humanists, what used to be called Free Thinkers. So as a humanist I am honoring my ancestors, which the Bible says is a good thing to do. We humanists try to behave as decently, as fairly, and as honorably as we can without any expectation of rewards or punishments in an afterlife. My brother and sister didn\u2019t think there was one, my parents and grandparents didn\u2019t think there was one. It was enough that they were alive. We humanists serve as best we can the only abstraction with which we have any real familiarity, which is our community.\nI am, incidentally, Honorary President of the American Humanist Association, having succeeded the late, great science fiction writer Isaac Asimov in that totally functionless capacity. We had a memorial service for Isaac a few years back, and I spoke and said at one point, \u201cIsaac is up in heaven now.\u201d It was the funniest thing I could have said to an audience of humanists. I rolled them in the aisles. It was several minutes before order could be restored. And if I should ever die, God forbid, I hope you will say, \u201cKurt is up in heaven now.\u201d That\u2019s my favorite joke.\nHow do humanists feel about Jesus? I say of Jesus, as all humanists do, \u201cIf what he said is good, and so much of it is absolutely beautiful, what does it matter if he was God or not?\u201d\nBut if Christ hadn\u2019t delivered the Sermon on the Mount, with its message of mercy and pity, I wouldn\u2019t want to be a human being.\nI\u2019d just as soon be a rattlesnake.\nHuman beings have had to guess about almost everything for the past million years or so. The leading characters in our history books have been our most enthralling, and sometimes our most terrifying, guessers.\nMay I name two of them?\nAristotle and Hitler.\nOne good guesser and one bad

They had three children. My mother was the oldest. And then Alice Barus died of pneumonia when Mother was six.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cShortly thereafter,\u201d says Uncle John, \u201cAlbert married a very attractive but extremely eccentric woman, who was never accepted by Albert\u2019s family or close friends. Her name was Ora D. Lane. She was an accomplished violinist and came from Zanesville, Ohio. She was familiarly known as \u2019O.D.\u2019 but most people referred to her as \u2019Odious.\u2019 She became a sort of storybook stepmother to Albert\u2019s children. She chastised and ill-treated them in subtle ways. She seemed to resent them and abused them so that they all suffered a distinctive psychic trauma from which they never fully recovered. Where formerly they had known nothing but loving and tender care, now they were subjected to every sort of indignity, humiliation, and neglect. She terrorized Albert as well, threatened his life, slept with a pistol under her pillow, and was a perfect demon and termagant. Kindly, gentle Albert stood it as long as he could and then divorced her; but he was obliged to settle a large alimony upon her which depleted his capital, which was not large. He had never been an accumulator and had spent freely, relying upon the brewery to carry him as usual with a large annual income.\n\u201cBut nothing daunted, Albert soon was married a third time to a nondescript widow named Meda Langtry, a Canadian, who had a daughter whom Albert adopted and renamed Alberta.\n\u201cMeda was much younger than Albert. In fact she was about the same age as his daughter Edith.\u201d\n\u201cShortly after Albert\u2019s third and last marriage came Prohibition in 1921,\u201d Uncle John goes on, \u201cthe brewery was closed. Albert lost his position, and from then on his affairs went from bad to worse until he died in what he would have regarded as relative poverty. The last years of his life were supported by the sale of several parcels of real estate including his former residence, a large house situated on an estate of a hundred acres on a hill overlooking White River and running north to Kessler Boulevard and West Fifty-sixth Street in the City of Indianapolis. This land would now be worth at least a million dollars or more.\n\u201cHe, like all rich men, had a miscellaneous assortment of personal property which will be acquired not for investment but as adjuncts of abundant privileges such as miscellaneous securities, paintings, porcelains, furniture, and other art objects. Much had to be sold but he had a few securities left and his estate inventory came to $311,607.65. All that his children got out of the Peter Lieber fortune was a small remnant from Albert\u2019s estate and a few trust funds which Peter had established for them in Merchants Bank stock. And so the proverbial cycle of \u2019shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves\u2019 was completed in three generations due for them to Prohibition and Albert\u2019s extravagance and improvidence.\n\u201cBut while Albert was still in his prime and riding high, his daughter, Edith\u2014K\u2019s mother\u2014was married on November 22, 1913, to Kurt Vonnegut. They were a charming and extremely attractive couple.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.13386147186147188], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["indianapolis",

were a family-size box of Tide, the washday miracle, and the yellow slicker and red helmet of a volunteer fireman, which hung on pegs by the office door. Eliot was a Fire Lieutenant. He could easily have been Captain or Chief, since he was a devoted and skilful fireman, and had given the Fire Department six new engines besides. It was at his own insistence that he held a rank no higher than Lieutenant.\nEliot, because he almost never left his office except to fight fires, was the man to whom all fire calls were sent. That was why he had two telephones by his cot. The black one was for Foundation calls. The red one was for fire calls. When a fire call came in, Eliot would push a red button mounted on the wall under his commission as a Notary Public. The button activated a doomsday bullhorn under the cupola on top of the firehouse. Eliot had paid for the horn, and the cupola, too.\nThere was an earsplitting thunderclap.\n\"Now, now\u2014now, now,\" said Eliot in his sleep.\nHis black telephone was about to ring. Eliot would awake and answer it by the third ring. He would say what he said to every caller, no matter what the hour:\n\"This is the Rosewater Foundation. How can we help you?\"\nIt was the Senator's conceit that Eliot trafficked with criminals. He was mistaken. Most of Eliot's clients weren't brave enough or clever enough for lives of crime. But Eliot, particularly when he argued with his father or his bankers or his lawyers, was almost equally mistaken about who his clients were. He would argue that the people he was trying to help were the same sorts of people who, in generations past, had cleared the forests, drained the swamps, built the bridges, people whose sons formed the backbone of the infantry in time of war\u2014and so on. The people who leaned on Eliot regularly were a lot weaker than that\u2014and dumber, too. When it came time for their sons to go into the Armed Forces, for instance, the sons were generally rejected as being mentally, morally, and physically undesirable.\nThere was a tough element among the Rosewater County poor who, as a matter of pride, stayed away from Eliot and his uncritical love, who had the guts to get out of Rosewater County and look for work in Indianapolis or Chicago or Detroit. Very few of them found steady work in those places, of course, but at least they tried.\nThe client who was about to make Eliot's black telephone ring was a sixty-eight-year-old virgin who, by almost anybody's standards, was too dumb to live. Her name was Diana Moon Glampers. No one had ever loved her. There was no reason why anyone should. She was ugly, stupid, and boring. On the rare occasions when she had to introduce herself, she always said her full name, and followed that with the mystifying equation that had thrust her into life so pointlessly:\n\"My mother was a Moon. My father was a Glampers.\"", -0.03125438054009483], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["women", 0.033783783783783786], ["expect", 0.02702702702702703], ["college", 0.02027027027027027], ["making", 0.02027027027027027], ["song", 0.013513513513513514], ["flew", 0.013513513513513514], ["shrapnel", 0.013513513513513514], ["night", 0.013513513513513514], ["second", 0.013513513513513514], ["ardent", 0.013513513513513514], ["sung", 0.013513513513513514], ["love", 0.013513513513513514], ["war", 0.013513513513513514], ["head", 0.013513513513513514], ["bullets", 0.013513513513513514], ["man", 0.013513513513513514], ["time", 0.013513513513513514], ["money", 0.006756756756756757], ["month", 0.006756756756756757], ["professors", 0.006756756756756757], ["businesses", 0.006756756756756757], ["subtle", 0.006756756756756757], ["children", 0.006756756756756757], ["perfect", 0.006756756756756757], ["readers", 0.006756756756756757], ["honoring", 0.006756756756756757], ["killed", 0.006756756756756757], ["going", 0.006756756756756757], ["happened", 0.006756756756756757], ["good", 0.006756756756756757], ["garden", 0.006756756756756757], ["males", 0.006756756756756757], ["earn", 0.006756756756756757], ["wives", 0.006756756756756757], ["shutting", 0.006756756756756757], ["gee", 0.006756756756756757], ["wedding", 0.006756756756756757], ["realize", 0.006756756756756757], ["school", 0.006756756756756757], ["respectful", 0.006756756756756757], ["raffish", 0.006756756756756757], ["tender", 0.006756756756756757], ["virginity", 0.006756756756756757], ["reactions", 0.006756756756756757], ["lifted", 0.006756756756756757], ["brave", 0.006756756756756757], ["ten", 0.006756756756756757], ["absolutely", 0.006756756756756757], ["dealing", 0.006756756756756757], ["sifting", 0.006756756756756757], ["frequency", 0.006756756756756757], ["soldiers", 0.006756756756756757], ["sexual", 0.006756756756756757], ["mournfully", 0.006756756756756757], ["depression", 0.006756756756756757], ["lovers", 0.006756756756756757], ["intercourse", 0.006756756756756757], ["poison", 0.006756756756756757], ["roughnecks", 0.006756756756756757], ["fountain", 0.006756756756756757], ["told", 0.006756756756756757], ["knowing", 0.006756756756756757], ["leg", 0.006756756756756757], ["cinders", 0.006756756756756757], ["reason", 0.006756756756756757], ["harvard", 0.006756756756756757], ["graduated", 0.006756756756756757], ["article", 0.006756756756756757], ["shocking", 0.006756756756756757], ["great", 0.006756756756756757], ["throwers", 0.006756756756756757], ["professions", 0.006756756756756757], ["trades", 0.006756756756756757], ["times", 0.006756756756756757], ["titillatingly", 0.006756756756756757], ["magazine", 0.006756756756756757], ["firemen", 0.006756756756756757], ["bangs", 0.006756756756756757], ["sexes", 0.006756756756756757], ["inspired", 0.006756756756756757], ["blown", 0.006756756756756757], ["appeared", 0.006756756756756757], ["standing", 0.006756756756756757], ["bursting", 0.006756756756756757], ["hunters", 0.006756756756756757], ["lions", 0.006756756756756757], ["debauched", 0.006756756756756757], ["gas", 0.006756756756756757], ["boys", 0.006756756756756757], ["properly", 0.006756756756756757], ["petrified", 0.006756756756756757], ["reproductive", 0.006756756756756757], ["middle", 0.006756756756756757], ["recall", 0.006756756756756757], ["farted", 0.006756756756756757], ["lion", 0.006756756756756757], ["bloomers", 0.006756756756756757], ["flame", 0.006756756756756757], ["fun", 0.006756756756756757], ["powers", 0.006756756756756757], ["professor", 0.006756756756756757], ["shook", 0.006756756756756757], ["mine", 0.006756756756756757], ["pieces", 0.006756756756756757], ["heard", 0.006756756756756757], ["mocked", 0.006756756756756757], ["throat", 0.006756756756756757], ["aged", 0.006756756756756757], ["organs", 0.006756756756756757], ["compared", 0.006756756756756757], ["daring", 0.006756756756756757], ["things", 0.006756756756756757], ["discussion", 0.006756756756756757], ["responsible", 0.006756756756756757], ["fears", 0.006756756756756757], ["american", 0.006756756756756757], ["terrific", 0.006756756756756757], ["week", 0.006756756756756757], ["hunt", 0.006756756756756757], ["chance", 0.006756756756756757], ["coming", 0.006756756756756757], ["sally", 0.006756756756756757], ["medical", 0.006756756756756757], ["classmate", 0.006756756756756757]], "sentiment": ["Readers of the words should realize, too, that I heard them sung not by middle-aged roughnecks, but by college boys, by children, really, who, with a Great Depression going on and with a Second World War coming, and with most of them mocked by their own virginity, had reason to be petrified of all the things that women of that time would expect of them. Women would expect them to earn good money after they graduated, and they did not see how they could do that, with all the businesses shutting down. Women would expect them to be brave soldiers, and there seemed every chance that they would go to pieces when the shrapnel and bullets flew. Who could be absolutely responsible for his own reactions when the shrapnel and bullets flew? There would be flame throwers and poison gas. There would be terrific bangs. The man standing beside you could have his head blown off\u2014and his throat would be a fountain.\nAnd women, when they became their wives, would expect them to be perfect lovers even on the wedding night\u2014subtle, tender, raffish, respectful, titillatingly debauched, and knowing as much about the reproductive organs of both sexes as Harvard Medical School.\nI recall a discussion of a daring magazine article that appeared at that time. It told of the frequency of sexual intercourse by American males in various professions and trades. Firemen were the most ardent, making love ten times a week.

Awful. I swear he was wearing the same baggy suit he wore when he said goodbye to us seven years ago. And I\u2019ll swear it hasn\u2019t been cleaned since then, either. I tried to get him to wear your old tuxedo, and he wouldn\u2019t hear of it. Went right over the way he was. I suppose a stiff shirt would have been worse in a way. It would have showed how dirty his neck is.\u201d\nShe pulled the neck of her dress lower, looked at herself in a mirror, and raised it slightly again\u2014a delicate compromise. \u201cHonestly,\u201d she said, talking to Paul\u2019s image in the mirror, \u201cI\u2019m crazy about that man\u2014you know I am. But he just looks awful all the time. I mean, after all, a man in his position, and not even clean.\u201d\nPaul smiled and shook his head. It was true. Finnerty had always been shockingly lax about his grooming, and some of his more fastidious supervisors in the old days had found it hard to believe that a man could be so staggeringly competent, and at the same time so unsanitary-looking. Occasionally, the tall, gaunt Irishman would surprise everyone\u2014usually between long stretches of work\u2014by showing up with his cheeks gleaming like wax apples, and with new shoes, socks, shirt, tie, and suit, and, presumably, underwear. Engineers\u2019 and managers\u2019 wives would make a big fuss over him, to show him that such care of himself was important and rewarding; and they declared that he was really the handsomest thing in the Ilium industrial fold. Quite possibly he was, in a coarse, weathered way: grotesquely handsome, like Abe Lincoln, but with a predatory, defiant cast to his eyes rather than the sadness of Lincoln\u2019s. After Finnerty\u2019s periodic outbursts of cleanliness and freshness, the wives would watch with increasing distress as he wore the entire celebrated outfit day in and day out, until the sands and soot and grease of time had filled every seam and pore.\nAnd Finnerty had other unsavory aspects. Into the resolutely monogamous and Eagle Scout-like society of engineers and managers, Finnerty often brought women he\u2019d picked up in Homestead a half-hour before. When it came time, after supper, to play games, Finnerty and the girl would generally take a highball in either hand and wander off to the shrub-walled first tee, if it was warm, or out to his car, if it was cold.\nHis car\u2014in the old days, anyway\u2014had been more disreputable than Paul\u2019s was today. In this direction, at least\u2014the most innocuous direction, socially\u2014Paul had imitated his friend. Finnerty had claimed that his love of books and records and good whisky kept him too broke to buy a car and clothes commensurate with his position in life. Paul had computed the value of Finnerty\u2019s record, book, and bottle collections and concluded that the Irishman would still have plenty left for even two new cars. It was then that Paul began to suspect that Finnerty\u2019s way of life wasn\u2019t as irrational as it seemed; that it was, in fact, a studied and elaborate insult to the managers and engineers of Ilium, and to their immaculate wives.\nWhy Finnerty had seen fit to offend these gentle people was never clear to Paul, who supposed the aggressiveness, like most aggressiveness, dated back to some childhood muddle. The only intimation as to what that childhood had been like had come not from Finnerty but from Kroner, who took a breeder\u2019s interest in his engineers\u2019 bloodlines. Kroner had once remarked, confidingly and with a show of sympathy, that Finnerty was a mutant, born of poor and stupid parents. The only insight Finnerty had ever permitted Paul was in a moment of deep depression, during a crushing hangover, when he\u2019d sighed and said he\u2019d never felt he belonged anywhere.\nPaul wondered about his own deep drives as he realized how much pleasure he was getting from recollections of Finnerty\u2019s socially destructive, undisciplined antics. Paul indulged himself in the wistful sensation of feeling that he, Paul, might be content, if only\u2014and let the thought stop there, as though he knew vaguely what lay beyond. He didn\u2019t.\nPaul envied Finnerty\u2019s mind, for Finnerty could be anything he wanted to be, and be brilliant at it. Whatever the times might have called for, Finnerty would have been among the best. If this had been the age of music, Finnerty would have been, and in fact was, a top-flight pianist\u2014or he might have been an architect or physician or writer. With inhuman intuition, Finnerty could sense the basic principles and motives of almost any human work, not just engineering.\nPaul could have been only what he was, he thought. As he filled his glass again, he supposed that he could only have come to this moment, this living room, into the presence of Anita.\nIt was an appalling thought, to be so well-integrated into the machinery of society and history as to be able to move in only one plane, and along one line. Finnerty\u2019s arrival was disturbing, for it brought to the surface the doubt that life should be that way. Paul had been thinking of hiring a psychiatrist to make him docile, content with his lot, amiable to all. But now, here was Finnerty, pushing him in the other direction. Finnerty had seemed to see something in Paul he hadn\u2019t seen in the others, something he\u2019d liked\u2014possibly a rebellious streak that Paul was only now beginning to suspect. For some reason Finnerty had made Paul his only friend.", 0.05030288975094171], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["francine", 0.05434782608695652], ["fuzz", 0.043478260869565216], ["office", 0.021739130434782608], ["afraid", 0.021739130434782608], ["clicked", 0.021739130434782608], ["window", 0.021739130434782608], ["public", 0.021739130434782608], ["read", 0.021739130434782608], ["smile", 0.021739130434782608], ["pefko", 0.021739130434782608], ["work", 0.021739130434782608], ["pamphlets", 0.021739130434782608], ["afforded", 0.010869565217391304], ["better", 0.010869565217391304], ["upstairs", 0.010869565217391304], ["people", 0.010869565217391304], ["wall", 0.010869565217391304], ["crippled", 0.010869565217391304], ["reedily", 0.010869565217391304], ["underside", 0.010869565217391304], ["fifty", 0.010869565217391304], ["feet", 0.010869565217391304], ["tiny", 0.010869565217391304], ["candy", 0.010869565217391304], ["lunchtime", 0.010869565217391304], ["twitched", 0.010869565217391304], ["thing", 0.010869565217391304], ["employment", 0.010869565217391304], ["clock", 0.010869565217391304], ["pipe", 0.010869565217391304], ["eminently", 0.010869565217391304], ["floor", 0.010869565217391304], ["began", 0.010869565217391304], ["remained", 0.010869565217391304], ["whistled", 0.010869565217391304], ["wrapper", 0.010869565217391304], ["terrific", 0.010869565217391304], ["eager", 0.010869565217391304], ["hiss", 0.010869565217391304], ["forward", 0.010869565217391304], ["party", 0.010869565217391304], ["microscopically", 0.010869565217391304], ["started", 0.010869565217391304], ["good", 0.010869565217391304], ["presentable", 0.010869565217391304], ["huge", 0.010869565217391304], ["gay", 0.010869565217391304], ["felt", 0.010869565217391304], ["frowned", 0.010869565217391304], ["imaginable", 0.010869565217391304], ["areaway", 0.010869565217391304], ["seconds", 0.010869565217391304], ["host", 0.010869565217391304], ["mouth", 0.010869565217391304], ["longest", 0.010869565217391304], ["dullest", 0.010869565217391304], ["roof", 0.010869565217391304], ["hand", 0.010869565217391304], ["nodded", 0.010869565217391304], ["day", 0.010869565217391304], ["minute", 0.010869565217391304], ["thought", 0.010869565217391304], ["rush", 0.010869565217391304], ["spit", 0.010869565217391304], ["hour", 0.010869565217391304], ["thirty", 0.010869565217391304], ["radiator", 0.010869565217391304], ["bang", 0.010869565217391304], ["looked", 0.010869565217391304], ["indication", 0.010869565217391304], ["place", 0.010869565217391304], ["tongue", 0.010869565217391304], ["minutes", 0.010869565217391304], ["steam", 0.010869565217391304], ["view", 0.010869565217391304]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWell, when does the public come?\u201d said Francine, looking down at her eminently presentable self.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid the public doesn\u2019t come out this far,\u201d said Fuzz.

I should have opened a bakery.\nSO FATHER STARTED coming home from work with pieces of the exhibit, which had been made to his order at Barrytron: pedestals and display cases, and explanatory signs and labels made by the print shop that did a lot of work for Barrytron. The crystals themselves came from a Pittsburgh chemical supply house that did a lot of business with Barrytron. One crystal, I remember, came all the way from Burma.\nThe chemical supply house must have gone to some trouble to get together a remarkable collection of crystals for us, since what they sent us couldn\u2019t have come from their regular stock. In order to please a big customer like Barrytron, they may have gone to somebody who collected and sold crystals for their beauty and rarity, not as chemicals but as jewelry.\nAt any rate, the crystals, which were of museum quality, caused Father to utter these famous last words after he spread them out on the coffee table in our living room, gloatingly: \u201cSon, there is no way we can lose.\u201d\nWELL, AS JEAN-PAUL Sartre says in Bartlett\u2019s Familiar Quotations, \u201cHell is other people.\u201d Other people made short work of Father\u2019s and my invincible contest entry in Cleveland 43 years ago.\nGenerals George Armstrong Custer at the Little Bighorn, and Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg, and William Westmoreland in Vietnam all come to mind.\nSOMEBODY SAID 1 time, I remember, that General Custer\u2019s famous last words were, \u201cWhere are all these blankety-blank Injuns comin\u2019 from?\u201d\nFATHER AND I, and not our pretty crystals, were for a little while the most fascinating exhibit in Moellenkamp Auditorium. We were a demonstration of abnormal psychology. Other contestants and their mentors gathered around us and put us through our paces. They certainly knew which buttons to push, so to speak, to make us change color or twist and turn or grin horribly or whatever.\nOne contestant asked Father how old he was and what high school he was attending.", 0.08881868131868133], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["alfred", 0.05442176870748299], ["pencil", 0.02040816326530612], ["mind", 0.02040816326530612], ["jobs", 0.013605442176870748], ["mmm", 0.013605442176870748], ["reached", 0.013605442176870748], ["numbers", 0.013605442176870748], ["astride", 0.013605442176870748], ["papers", 0.013605442176870748], ["picture", 0.013605442176870748], ["chief", 0.013605442176870748], ["lightbulb", 0.006802721088435374], ["code", 0.006802721088435374], ["hands", 0.006802721088435374], ["stumped", 0.006802721088435374], ["executed", 0.006802721088435374], ["stalker", 0.006802721088435374], ["disturbance", 0.006802721088435374], ["clutching", 0.006802721088435374], ["sheaf", 0.006802721088435374], ["better", 0.006802721088435374], ["going", 0.006802721088435374], ["exhaled", 0.006802721088435374], ["decreased", 0.006802721088435374], ["struck", 0.006802721088435374], ["smart", 0.006802721088435374], ["designate", 0.006802721088435374], ["plants", 0.006802721088435374], ["woman", 0.006802721088435374], ["big", 0.006802721088435374], ["16a", 0.006802721088435374], ["frowning", 0.006802721088435374], ["game", 0.006802721088435374], ["pageant", 0.006802721088435374], ["belittle", 0.006802721088435374], ["sixteen", 0.006802721088435374], ["dreams", 0.006802721088435374], ["room", 0.006802721088435374], ["knock", 0.006802721088435374], ["exits", 0.006802721088435374], ["manual", 0.006802721088435374], ["large", 0.006802721088435374], ["remind", 0.006802721088435374], ["dismounted", 0.006802721088435374], ["paper", 0.006802721088435374], ["hung", 0.006802721088435374], ["fogging", 0.006802721088435374], ["demille", 0.006802721088435374], ["fired", 0.006802721088435374], ["colossal", 0.006802721088435374], ["series", 0.006802721088435374], ["defense", 0.006802721088435374], ["subcontracts", 0.006802721088435374], ["wire", 0.006802721088435374], ["stood", 0.006802721088435374], ["forty", 0.006802721088435374], ["pen", 0.006802721088435374], ["ranged", 0.006802721088435374], ["slow", 0.006802721088435374], ["fifteen", 0.006802721088435374], ["tragedy", 0.006802721088435374], ["dry", 0.006802721088435374], ["carried", 0.006802721088435374], ["freely", 0.006802721088435374], ["bronk", 0.006802721088435374], ["messages", 0.006802721088435374], ["motion", 0.006802721088435374], ["wrote", 0.006802721088435374], ["ladies", 0.006802721088435374], ["lied", 0.006802721088435374], ["emblazoned", 0.006802721088435374], ["perspiring", 0.006802721088435374], ["image", 0.006802721088435374], ["hunched", 0.006802721088435374], ["number", 0.006802721088435374], ["smithereens", 0.006802721088435374], ["murmured", 0.006802721088435374], ["eye", 0.006802721088435374], ["sweater", 0.006802721088435374], ["arms", 0.006802721088435374], ["blushed", 0.006802721088435374], ["gaze", 0.006802721088435374], ["lot", 0.006802721088435374], ["memo", 0.006802721088435374], ["clue", 0.006802721088435374], ["recalled", 0.006802721088435374], ["western", 0.006802721088435374], ["rifle", 0.006802721088435374], ["baby", 0.006802721088435374], ["couldn", 0.006802721088435374], ["shoot", 0.006802721088435374], ["sheridan", 0.006802721088435374], ["flamboyant", 0.006802721088435374], ["wore", 0.006802721088435374], ["noiselessly", 0.006802721088435374], ["will", 0.006802721088435374], ["forgetting", 0.006802721088435374], ["crossed", 0.006802721088435374], ["minutes", 0.006802721088435374], ["dissolve", 0.006802721088435374], ["slightest", 0.006802721088435374], ["pony", 0.006802721088435374], ["ann", 0.006802721088435374], ["general", 0.006802721088435374], ["allowed", 0.006802721088435374], ["moorhead", 0.006802721088435374], ["ava", 0.006802721088435374], ["sat", 0.006802721088435374], ["brandished", 0.006802721088435374], ["savor", 0.006802721088435374], ["began", 0.006802721088435374], ["dissolved", 0.006802721088435374], ["cecil", 0.006802721088435374], ["forehead", 0.006802721088435374], ["pad", 0.006802721088435374], ["tapped", 0.006802721088435374], ["star", 0.006802721088435374], ["electric", 0.006802721088435374], ["gardner", 0.006802721088435374], ["lay", 0.006802721088435374], ["alarmed", 0.006802721088435374], ["third", 0.006802721088435374], ["considered", 0.006802721088435374], ["contact", 0.006802721088435374], ["time", 0.006802721088435374], ["ellen", 0.006802721088435374], ["order", 0.006802721088435374], ["clasped", 0.006802721088435374]], "sentiment": ["Alfred\u2019s pen had gone dry, and he couldn\u2019t lay his hands on a pencil without getting up, so he lied. \u201cOkay, got one. Shoot.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re getting a lot of subcontracts on big defense jobs, and a new series of code numbers is going to be used for these jobs. Any number beginning with Sixteen A will designate that it\u2019s one of them. Better wire all our plants about it.\u201d\nIn Alfred\u2019s mind, Ava Gardner executed a smart manual of arms with a rifle. Emblazoned on her sweater was a large 16A. \u201cRight, chief.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a memo here from \u2026\u201d\nFifteen minutes later, Alfred, perspiring freely, said, \u201cRight, chief,\u201d for the forty-third time and hung up. Before his mind\u2019s eye was a pageant to belittle the most flamboyant dreams of Cecil B. DeMille. Ranged about Alfred was every woman motion picture star he had ever seen, and each brandished or wore or carried or sat astride something Alfred could be fired for forgetting. The image was colossal, and the slightest disturbance might knock it to smithereens. He had to get to pencil and paper before tragedy struck. He crossed the room like a game-stalker, hunched, noiselessly.\n\u201cMr. Moorhead, are you all right?\u201d said Ellen, alarmed.\n\u201cMmm. Mmm!\u201d said Alfred, frowning.\nHe reached the pencil and pad, and exhaled. The picture was fogging, but it was still there. Alfred considered the ladies one by one, wrote down their messages, and allowed them to dissolve.\nAs their numbers decreased, he began to slow their exits in order to savor them.

After Dwayne ran amok, the local paper ran a deeply sympathetic editorial about it, begging people to watch each other for danger signals. Here was its title:\nA CRY FOR HELP\nBut Dwayne wasn\u2019t all that weird before he met Kilgore Trout. His behavior in public kept him well within the limits of acceptable acts and beliefs and conversations in Midland City. The person closest to him, Francine Pefko, his white secretary and mistress, said that Dwayne seemed to be getting happier and happier all the time during the month before Dwayne went public as a maniac.\n\u201cI kept thinking,\u201d she told a newspaper reporter from her hospital bed, \u201c\u2018He is finally getting over his wife\u2019s suicide.\u2019\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFrancine worked at Dwayne\u2019s principal place of business, which was Dwayne Hoover\u2019s Exit Eleven Pontiac Village, just off the Interstate, next door to the new Holiday Inn.\nHere is what made Francine think he was becoming happier: Dwayne began to sing songs which had been popular in his youth, such as \u201cThe Old Lamp Lighter,\u201d and \u201cTippy-Tippy-Tin,\u201d and \u201cHold Tight,\u201d and \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d and so on. Dwayne had never sung before. Now he did it loudly as he sat at his desk, when he took a customer for a ride in a demonstrator, when he watched a mechanic service a car. One day he sang loudly as he crossed the lobby of the new Holiday Inn, smiling and gesturing at people as though he had been hired to sing for their pleasure. But nobody thought that was necessarily a hint of derangement, either\u2014especially since Dwayne owned a piece of the Inn.\nA black bus boy and a black waiter discussed this singing. \u201cListen at him sing,\u201d said the bus boy.\n\u201cIf I owned what he owns, I\u2019d sing, too,\u201d the waiter replied.", 0.05292699724517907], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["earl", 0.043478260869565216], ["holes", 0.043478260869565216], ["ground", 0.03260869565217391], ["ain", 0.03260869565217391], ["simulated", 0.03260869565217391], ["real", 0.021739130434782608], ["crazy", 0.021739130434782608], ["wasn", 0.021739130434782608], ["close", 0.021739130434782608], ["orders", 0.021739130434782608], ["shells", 0.021739130434782608], ["going", 0.021739130434782608], ["folks", 0.021739130434782608], ["big", 0.021739130434782608], ["wars", 0.021739130434782608], ["poritsky", 0.021739130434782608], ["playing", 0.021739130434782608], ["em", 0.010869565217391304], ["walking", 0.010869565217391304], ["eardrums", 0.010869565217391304], ["tree", 0.010869565217391304], ["deep", 0.010869565217391304], ["course", 0.010869565217391304], ["noise", 0.010869565217391304], ["everbody", 0.010869565217391304], ["stayed", 0.010869565217391304], ["hell", 0.010869565217391304], ["captain", 0.010869565217391304], ["standing", 0.010869565217391304], ["quit", 0.010869565217391304], ["cut", 0.010869565217391304], ["simulating", 0.010869565217391304], ["things", 0.010869565217391304], ["bust", 0.010869565217391304], ["bedbug", 0.010869565217391304], ["music", 0.010869565217391304], ["lot", 0.010869565217391304], ["time", 0.010869565217391304], ["enjoying", 0.010869565217391304], ["guns", 0.010869565217391304], ["tunnels", 0.010869565217391304], ["giants", 0.010869565217391304], ["shell", 0.010869565217391304], ["protection", 0.010869565217391304], ["funny", 0.010869565217391304], ["shallow", 0.010869565217391304], ["hurt", 0.010869565217391304], ["sore", 0.010869565217391304], ["barrage", 0.010869565217391304], ["soldiers", 0.010869565217391304], ["alive", 0.010869565217391304], ["coming", 0.010869565217391304], ["ascared", 0.010869565217391304], ["wanted", 0.010869565217391304], ["apart", 0.010869565217391304], ["enemy", 0.010869565217391304], ["lawn", 0.010869565217391304], ["generals", 0.010869565217391304], ["mower", 0.010869565217391304], ["left", 0.010869565217391304], ["places", 0.010869565217391304], ["kicking", 0.010869565217391304], ["everwheres", 0.010869565217391304], ["days", 0.010869565217391304], ["roof", 0.010869565217391304], ["good", 0.010869565217391304], ["grass", 0.010869565217391304], ["expect", 0.010869565217391304]], "sentiment": ["Up above ground a big shell went off, and liked to bust our eardrums.
