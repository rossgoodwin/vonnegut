Sylvia enjoyed arguing with her husband about her lack of reserve and his excess of it, enjoyed saying, toward the end of arguments like that, \"Well, I guess I\u2019m just a simple-minded country girl at heart, and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be, and I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to get used to it.\"\nBut Doctor Remenzel didn\u2019t want to play that game. He found the dormitory plans more interesting.\n\"Will the new rooms have fireplaces?\" said Sylvia. In the oldest part of the dormitory, several of the rooms had handsome fireplaces.\n\"That would practically double the cost of construction,\" said the doctor.\n\"I want Eli to have a room with a fireplace, if that\u2019s possible,\" said Sylvia.\n\"Those rooms are for seniors.\"", 0.2433512140033879], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["review", 0.046875], ["september", 0.03125], ["vonnegut", 0.03125], ["vance", 0.03125], ["1977", 0.03125], ["roth", 0.03125], ["kurt", 0.03125], ["sense", 0.015625], ["turned", 0.015625], ["number", 0.015625], ["deep", 0.015625], ["bourjaily", 0.015625], ["16", 0.015625], ["army", 0.015625], ["beautifully", 0.015625], ["dear", 0.015625], ["balcony", 0.015625], ["city", 0.015625], ["memorial", 0.015625], ["service", 0.015625], ["sit", 0.015625], ["bridgehampton", 0.015625], ["late", 0.015625], ["written", 0.015625], ["book", 0.015625], ["reader", 0.015625], ["privilege", 0.015625], ["hope", 0.015625], ["jones", 0.015625], ["good", 0.015625], ["lot", 0.015625], ["sitting", 0.015625], ["read", 0.015625], ["bugler", 0.015625], ["cheers", 0.015625], ["whistle", 0.015625], ["jill", 0.015625], ["york", 0.015625], ["nytbr", 0.015625], ["philip", 0.015625], ["copy", 0.015625], ["desire", 0.015625], ["advance", 0.015625], ["13", 0.015625], ["novel", 0.015625], ["instructive", 0.015625], ["james", 0.015625], ["professor", 0.015625], ["crowded", 0.015625], ["will", 0.015625], ["american", 0.015625], ["person", 0.015625], ["place", 0.015625], ["taps", 0.015625], ["unusually", 0.015625], ["sounded", 0.015625]], "sentiment": ["Kurt Vonnegut\nSeptember 13, 1977\nNew York City\nTO VANCE BOURJAILY\nPhilip Roth\u2019s novel was The Professor of Desire.\nDear Vance\u2014\nRead your review of Roth\u2019s book in an advance copy of NYTBR.
