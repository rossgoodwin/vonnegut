To do this would be to turn out something after the fashion of somebody-or-other, and I might be able to do it. I say might. It amounts to signing on with any of a dozen schools born ten, twenty, thirty years ago. The kicks are based largely on having passed off a creditable counterfeit. And, of course, if you appear in the Atlantic or Harper\u2019s or the New Yorker, by God you must be a writer, because everybody says so. This is poor competition for the fat checks from the slicks. For want of anything more tempting, I\u2019ll stick with money.\nSo, having said that much, where am I? In Alplaus, New York, I guess, wishing I could pick up some fire and confidence and originality and fresh prejudices from somewhere. As Slotkin said, these things are group products. It isn\u2019t a question of finding a Messiah, but of a group\u2019s creating one\u2014and it\u2019s hard work, and takes a while.\nIf this sort of thing is going on somewhere (not in Paris, says Tennessee Williams), I\u2019d love to get in on it. I\u2019d give my right arm to be enthusiastic. God knows there\u2019s plenty to write about\u2014more now than ever before, certainly. You\u2019re defaulting, I\u2019m defaulting\u2014everybody\u2019s defaulting, seems to me.\nIf Slotkin\u2019s right, maybe the death of the institution of friendship is the death of innovation in the arts.\nThis letter is sententious crap, shot full of self-pity. But it\u2019s the kind of letter writers seem to write; and since I quit G-E, if I\u2019m not a writer then I\u2019m nothing.\nYours truly,\nKurt\nFebruary 26, 1951\n[Alplaus, NY]\nTO MILLER HARRIS",

children in intellectually humble American homes back then weren\u2019t swamped with countless stories from TV sets. They heard or read only a few stories, and so could remember them, and maybe learn something from them. Everywhere in the English-speaking world, one of those was \u201cCinderella.\u201d Another was \u201cThe Ugly Duckling.\u201d Another was the story of Robin Hood.\nAnd another, as disrespectful of established authority as the story of Robin Hood, which \u201cCinderella\u201d and \u201cThe Ugly Duckling\u201d are not, is the life of Jesus Christ as described in the New Testament.\nG-men, under orders from J. Edgar Hoover, the unmarried homosexual director of the FBI, shot Dillinger dead, simply executed him as he came out of a movie theater with a date. He hadn\u2019t pulled a gun, or lunged or dived, or tried to run away. He was like anybody else coming out into the real world after a movie, awakening from enchantment. He was killed because he had for too long made G-men, all of whom then wore fedoras, look non compos mentis, like nincompoops.\nThat was in 1934. I was eleven. Allie was sixteen. Allie wept and raged, and we both reviled Dillinger\u2019s date at the movie. This bitch, and there was nothing else to call her, tipped off the feds about where Dillinger would be that night. She said she would be wearing an orange dress. The nondescript gink by her side when she came out would be the man the gay director of the FBI had branded Public Enemy Number One.\nShe was Hungarian. As the old saying goes: \u201cIf you have a Hungarian for a friend, you don\u2019t need an enemy.\u201d\nAllie later had her picture taken with Dillinger\u2019s big tombstone at Crown Hill, not far from the fence on West Thirty-eighth Street. I myself came upon it from time to time, while shooting crows with a .22 semiautomatic rifle our gun-nut father gave me for my birthday. Crows back then were classified as enemies of mankind. Given half a chance, they would eat our corn.\nOne kid I knew shot a golden eagle. You should have seen the wingspread!\nAllie hated hunting so much that I stopped doing it, and so did Father. As I\u2019ve written elsewhere, he had become a gun nut and hunter in order to prove that he wasn\u2019t effeminate, even though he was in the arts, an architect and a painter and potter.

about here,\u201d said Mr. Banghart, opening the car door and stepping onto the sidewalk. Haley followed, forgetting to thank the bemused driver, and pursued his companion, who disappeared into the tight currents of the city\u2019s Sunday strollers.\nHe caught up with him at an intersection in the bizarre shadows of the elevated overhead. Mr. Banghart was talking earnestly with a policeman, who pointed down the street and shouted above the rumble of trains. \u201cThe employment office opens at 8 in the morning,\u201d the policeman said. \u201cGot any money for food and a bed tonight?\u201d Mr. Banghart shrugged and grinned sheepishly. \u201cThen hurry up and get over to the Mission before all the beds are gone,\u201d said the policeman severely. He tapped Mr. Banghart\u2019s shoulder lightly with his nightstick. \u201cAnd keep out of trouble.\u201d\nHaley kept his distance until the policeman had finished his piece, then walked beside Mr. Banghart, who took no notice of him, but strode along muttering to himself. Haley read his lips. \u201cKeep out of trouble, keep out of trouble,\u201d he was saying.\nHaley nudged his arm to get his attention. His companion\u2019s reaction was instant and violent. Haley felt himself seized by his gathered shirtfront and twisted to face Mr. Banghart. \u201cJust let the others make sure they keep out of trouble, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Mr. Banghart fiercely. He relaxed his grip under the fascinated glances of passers-by eddying about them. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean anything by it. I know you\u2019re a friend.\u201d\nHaley\u2019s impulse was to get away from Mr. Banghart, whose eyes grew more lunatic by the second, but the ranks of unfamiliar faces seemed the more ominous, so he continued to trudge, fearfully, by his side. Following the policeman\u2019s directions, the two of them turned a corner and found themselves on a quiet side street, three blocks long. The city\u2019s noises sounded like a distant surf behind them. Warehouse walls banked the street\u2019s left side, their brick faces daubed with posters\u2014tattered reminders of a war-bond drive, a musical comedy, a political campaign, and the Greatest Show on Earth. Haley looked from these to the buildings facing them, his eyes running from the twin green globes marking a police station, the worst of Victorian architecture patinated with soot, to a dozen narrow-fronted hotels, taverns, pawnshops, and, at the far end, the blinking cross of the Mission. As though in bas relief, the still, gray figures of silent men stood in doorways or napped on stone steps and the lower treads of fire escapes.\n\u201cHey, buddy, give a pal a smoke, will you?\u201d said a toothless man, stepping from the shadows of an alley.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t smoke,\u201d said Haley weakly.\n\u201cTrash,\u201d said Mr. Banghart. \u201cIgnore them.\u201d\n\u201cHey, pal, lemme talk to you a minute. . . . Buddy, got a cigarette? . . . Spare a dime?\u201d whined a hundred voices as Haley and Mr. Banghart picked their way to the Mission. Annie would be preparing dinner now, Haley thought wistfully.\nWhen they entered the Mission, which Haley saw was an old storeroom filled with benches, a pale young man was standing behind a pulpit, swinging his arms vigorously in time to the hymn he was leading. They took seats by themselves on the rearmost bench. From the room behind the pulpit came a clinking of heavy bowls and the dense smell of boiling kraut. Two dozen unkempt men mumbled the words in their hymnals under the haranguing of the leader.

Two were ramshackle old men\u2014droolers as toothless as carp. They were irregulars, armed and clothed fragmentarily with junk taken from real soldiers who were newly dead. So it goes. They were farmers from just across the German border, not far away.\nTheir commander was a middle-aged corporal\u2014red-eyed, scrawny, tough as dried beef, sick of war. He had been wounded four times\u2014and patched up, and sent back to war. He was a very good soldier\u2014about to quit, about to find somebody to surrender to. His bandy legs were thrust into golden cavalry boots which he had taken from a dead Hungarian colonel on the Russian front. So it goes.\nThose boots were almost all he owned in this world. They were his home. An anecdote: One time a recruit was watching him bone and wax those golden boots, and he held one up to the recruit and said, \u201cIf you look in there deeply enough, you\u2019ll see Adam and Eve.\u201d\nBilly Pilgrim had not heard this anecdote. But, lying on the black ice there, Billy stared into the patina of the corporal\u2019s boots, saw Adam and Eve in the golden depths. They were naked. They were so innocent, so vulnerable, so eager to behave decently. Billy Pilgrim loved them.\nNext to the golden boots were a pair of feet which were swaddled in rags. They were crisscrossed by canvas straps, were shod with hinged wooden clogs. Billy looked up at the face that went with the clogs. It was the face of a blond angel, of a fifteen-year-old boy.\nThe boy was as beautiful as Eve.\nBilly was helped to his feet by the lovely boy, by the heavenly androgyne. And the others came forward to dust the snow off Billy, and then they searched him for weapons. He didn\u2019t have any. The most dangerous thing they found on his person was a two-inch pencil stub.\nThree inoffensive bangs came from far away. They came from German rifles. The two scouts who had ditched Billy and Weary had just been shot. They had been lying in ambush for Germans. They had been discovered and shot from behind. Now they were dying in the snow, feeling nothing, turning the snow to the color of raspberry sherbet. So it goes. So Roland Weary was the last of the Three Musketeers.\nAnd Weary, bug-eyed with terror, was being disarmed. The corporal gave Weary\u2019s pistol to the pretty boy.

A lot had happened since their last visit.\nFor one thing, Malachi Constant had sold out all his holdings in Galactic Spacecraft, the corporation that had the custody of the great rocket ship called The Whale. He had done this to destroy every connection between himself and the only known means of getting to Mars. He had put the proceeds of the sale into MoonMist Tobacco.\nFor another thing, Beatrice Rumfoord had liquidated her diversified portfolio of securities, and had put the proceeds into shares of Galactic Spacecraft, intending thereby to get a leather-lunged voice in whatever was done with The Whale.\nFor another thing, Malachi Constant had taken to writing Beatrice Rumfoord offensive letters, in order to keep her away\u2014in order to make himself absolutely and permanently intolerable to her. To see one of these letters was to see them all. The most recent one went like this, written on stationery of Magnum Opus, Inc., the corporation whose sole purpose was to manage the financial affairs of Malachi Constant.\nHello from sunny California, Space Baby! Gee, I am sure looking forward to jazzing a high-class dame like you under the twin moons of Mars. You\u2019re the only kind of dame I never had, and I\u2019ll bet your kind is the greatest. Love and kisses for a starter. Mal.\nFor another thing, Beatrice had bought a capsule of cyanide\u2014more deadly, surely, than Cleopatra\u2019s asp. It was Beatrice\u2019s intention to swallow it if ever she had to share so much as the same time zone with Malachi Constant.\nFor another thing, the stock market had crashed, wiping out Beatrice Rumfoord, among others. She had bought Galactic Spacecraft shares at prices ranging from 151\u00bd to 169. The stock had fallen to 6 in ten trading sessions, and now lay there, trembling fractional points. Since Beatrice had bought on margin as well as for cash, she had lost everything, including her Newport home.

And while we do that, our waste products continue to make the air unbreathable and the water undrinkable, and more and more life forms are dying because of us.\nThis is a university, isn\u2019t it?

What thanks did Semmelweis get from the leaders of his profession in Viennese society, guessers all? He was forced out of the hospital and out of Austria itself, whose people he had served so well. He finished his career in a provincial hospital in Hungary. There he gave up on humanity\u2014which is us, and our information-age knowledge\u2014and on himself.\nOne day, in the dissecting room, he took the blade of a scalpel with which he had been cutting up a corpse, and he stuck it on purpose into the palm of his hand. He died, as he knew he would, of blood poisoning soon afterward.\nThe guessers had had all the power. They had won again. Germs indeed. The guessers revealed something else about themselves, too, which we should duly note today. They aren\u2019t really interested in saving lives. What matters to them is being listened to\u2014as, however ignorantly, their guessing goes on and on and on. If there\u2019s anything they hate, it\u2019s a wise human.\nSo be one anyway. Save our lives and your lives, too. Be honorable.\n9\n\u201cDo unto others what you would have them do unto you.\u201d A lot of people think Jesus said that, because it is so much the sort of thing Jesus liked to say. But it was actually said by Confucius, a Chinese philosopher, five hundred years before there was that greatest and most humane of human beings, named Jesus Christ.\nThe Chinese also gave us, via Marco Polo, pasta and the formula for gunpowder. The Chinese were so dumb they only used gunpowder for fireworks. And everybody was so dumb back then that nobody in either hemisphere even knew that there was another one.\nWe\u2019ve sure come a long way since then. Sometimes I wish we hadn\u2019t. I hate H-bombs and the Jerry Springer Show.\nBut back to people like Confucius and Jesus and my son the doctor, Mark, each of whom have said in their own way how we could behave more humanely and maybe make the world a less painful place.

His health deteriorated slowly until it was found that he had a cancer in one of the lobes of his lungs. The surgeons wanted to operate but he wisely declined. As the cancer spread, he became extremely weak and short of breath with lack of oxygen. But he refused to go into a hospital or to remain in bed at home. He would get up in the morning, dress, eat very sparingly, and then lie about on a couch before a comfortable fire reading or listening to his records, quite alone. He had no nurses, was completely self-reliant, and never complained or feared death. Toward the end a faithful devoted old servant\u2014Nelly\u2014came down to look after him. Just before the end he had a trained nurse in attendance as he became bedfast. He died quietly in his sleep on October 1, 1957\u2014quite alone. Two days later his remains were buried in the Vonnegut lot in Crown Hill Cemetery next to his wife Edith and his parents, Bernard and Nanette.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere ends my Uncle John\u2019s essay, save for a grandiloquent coda not entirely in keeping with the facts. I have left a lot out, but nothing which has a direct bearing on what I myself have become. It is copyrighted.\nThe owner of the copyright is Uncle John\u2019s grandson, my second cousin once-removed, William Rauch. He works here in New York now for Mayor Edward Koch. See how we disperse and disperse?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWas I a sad child, knowing how rich my family had been? Not at all. We were at least as well off as most of the people I went to public school with, and I would have lost all my friends if we had started having servants again, and worn expensive clothes again, and ridden on ocean liners and visited German relatives in a real castle, and on and on. Mother, who was half-cracked, used to speak of the time when I would resume my proper place in society when the Great Depression ended, would swim with members of other leading families at the Indianapolis Athletic Club, would play tennis and golf with them at the Woodstock Golf and Country Club. She could not understand that to give up my friends at Public School No. 43, \u201cthe James Whitcomb Riley school,\u201d by the way, would be for me to give up everything.\nI still feel uneasy about prosperity and associating with members of my parents\u2019 class on that account.\nHenry David Thoreau said, \u201cI have traveled extensively in Concord.\u201d That quotation was probably first brought to my attention by one of my magnificent teachers in high school. Thoreau, I now feel, wrote in the voice of a child, as do I. And what he said about Concord is what every child feels, what every child seemingly must feel, about the place where he or she was born. There is surely more than enough to marvel at for a lifetime, no matter where the child is born.\nCastles?

And it came to pass.\n\u201cNever mind babies,\u201d I said. \u201cThink of the new era that is being born. The world has learned its lesson at last, at last. The closing chapter to ten thousand years of madness and greed is being written right here and now\u2014in Nuremberg. Books will be written about it. Movies will be made about it. It\u2019s the most important turning point in history.\u201d I believed it.\n\u201cWalter,\u201d she said, \u201csometimes I think you are only eight years old.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only age to be,\u201d I said, \u201cwhen a new era is being born.\u201d\nClocks struck six all over town. A new voice joined the chorus of public chimes and bells. It was in fact an old voice in Nuremberg, but Ruth and I had never heard it before. It was the deep bonging of the M\u00e4nnleinlaufen, the bizarre clock of the distant Frauenkirche. That clock was built more than four hundred years ago. My ancestors, both Lithuanian and Polish, would have been fighting Ivan the Terrible back then.\nThe visible part of the clock consisted of seven robots, which represented seven fourteenth-century electors. They were designed to circle an eighth robot, which represented the Holy Roman Emperor Charles the Fourth, and to celebrate his exclusion, in Thirteen-hundred and Fifty-six, of the Papacy from the selection of German rulers. The clock had been knocked out by bombing. American soldiers who were clever with machinery had begun on their own time to tinker with it as soon as they occupied the city. Most Germans I had talked to were so demoralized that they did not care if the M\u00e4nnleinlaufen never ran again. But it was running again, anyway.

She worked her way through the University of Wyoming, in Laramie, of all places, which I guess was about as far away from Peru as she could get without leaving the Milky Way. That was where she met her husband, who was then a student in the university\u2019s School of Veterinary Science.\nOnly after the Vietnam War, with Jack long dead, did Margaret and I realize that she wanted nothing more to do with Peru because so many people there knew she came from a family famous for spawning lunatics. And then she got married, keeping her family\u2019s terrifying history to herself, and she reproduced.\nMy own wife married and reproduced in all innocence of the danger she herself was in, and the risk she would pass on to our children.\nOUR OWN CHILDREN, having grown up with a notoriously insane grandmother in the house, fled this valley as soon as they could, just as she had fled Peru. But they haven\u2019t reproduced, and with their knowing what they do about their booby-trapped genes, I doubt that they ever will.\nJACK PATTON NEVER married. He never said he wanted kids. That could be a clue that he did know about his crazy relatives in Peru, after all. But I don\u2019t believe that. He was against everybody\u2019s reproducing, since human beings were, in his own words, \u201cabout 1,000 times dumber and meaner than they think they are.\u201d\nI myself, obviously, have finally come around to his point of view.\nDuring our plebe year, I remember, Jack all of a sudden decided that he was going to be a cartoonist, although he had never thought of being that before. He was compulsive. I could imagine him back in high school in Wyoming, all of a sudden deciding to build an electric chair for rats.\nThe first cartoon he ever drew, and the last one, was of 2 rhinoceroses getting married. A regular human preacher in a church was saying to the congregation that anybody who knew any reason these 2 should not be joined together in holy matrimony should speak now or forever hold his peace.\nThis was long before I had even met his sister Margaret.\nWe were roommates, and would be for all 4 years.

But Dwayne spent a worse one.\nHere is what the last night of that weekend was like for Dwayne: his bad chemicals rolled him out of bed. They made him dress as though there were some sort of emergency with which he had to deal. This was in the wee hours. Veterans\u2019 Day had ended at the stroke of twelve.\nDwayne\u2019s bad chemicals made him take a loaded thirty-eight caliber revolver from under his pillow and stick it in his mouth. This was a tool whose only purpose was to make holes in human beings. It looked like this:\nIn Dwayne\u2019s part of the planet, anybody who wanted one could get one down at his local hardware store. Policemen all had them. So did the criminals. So did the people caught in between.\nCriminals would point guns at people and say, \u201cGive me all your money,\u201d and the people usually would. And policemen would point their guns at criminals and say, \u201cStop\u201d or whatever the situation called for, and the criminals usually would. Sometimes they wouldn\u2019t. Sometimes a wife would get so mad at her husband that she would put a hole in him with a gun. Sometimes a husband would get so mad at his wife that he would put a hole in her. And so on.\nIn the same week Dwayne Hoover ran amok, a fourteen-year-old Midland City boy put holes in his mother and father because he didn\u2019t want to show them the bad report card he had brought home. His lawyer planned to enter a plea of temporary insanity, which meant that at the time of the shooting the boy was unable to distinguish the difference between right and wrong.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSometimes people would put holes in famous people so they could be at least fairly famous, too. Sometimes people would get on airplanes which were supposed to fly to someplace, and they would offer to put holes in the pilot and copilot unless they flew the airplane to someplace else.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDwayne held the muzzle of his gun in his mouth for a while. He tasted oil. The gun was loaded and cocked. There were neat little metal packages containing charcoal, potassium nitrate and sulphur only inches from his brains. He had only to trip a lever, and the powder would turn to gas.
