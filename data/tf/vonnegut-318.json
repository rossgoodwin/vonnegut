["New York City\nTO MARIA PILAR AND JOS\u00c9 DONOSO\nHeinrich B\u00f6ll was a German author who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972. He had been drafted into the Wehrmacht in WWII and was a P.O.W. of the Americans, as Kurt was a P.O.W. of the Germans.\nDear Maria Pilar and Pep\u00e9\u2014\nAll continues to go reasonably well here. Jill will be 45 on this coming Tuesday, and I am giving her a party at the Tavern on the Green in Central Park. I wish you two could be there, but understand that you have a rich social life where you are. We all heard about the recent dinner party. I was in London at the time, taping a conversation with Heinrich B\u00f6ll for BBC. Poor, saintly Heinrich is very sick, with diabetes and circulatory problems in his legs, and without much hope for humankind. The conversation, undirected and without a third person present, was a flop, I think, because of my respect for him and his total despair. We were taped for three hours, in the hopes that one hour of good talk could be distilled from it. I haven\u2019t heard, but my guess is that they will be lucky to get a three minute show out of it.\nHe will surely be invited as an honored guest at the International P.E.N. Congress to be held here late in January of 1986. His feeling was that he would be too sick and weary to travel that far from Cologne. This will be the first Congress to be held in the United States for twenty years, and, since so many people are eager to come to New York, it could easily be the most extraordinary gathering of good writers in this century. American P.E.N. is of course particularly eager, Pep\u00e9, that you be among that number when, as Louis Armstrong used to say, \u201cthe saints come marching in.\u201d\nI have just handed in a novel called Galapagos, set in Ecuador, as unlikely as that seems. That is the only South American country this provincial author has ever visited, and I doubt very much whether he understood much of what he heard and saw. The main point of the book is to complete a five-book contract with Dell Publishing. For the first time since about 1951, I don\u2019t owe anybody a book. I am not at all sure that I want to write another one. My brains aren\u2019t nearly as quick and lucky as they used to be. Also\u2014justice doesn\u2019t seem to be the popular subject it once was, when I was young.\nAs you may already know: Jane is the same, good old Jane for the moment, recovering slowly, however, from an exploratory operation which did her body much violence. The exploration resulted in the discovery and removal of two small tumors which were not up to anything immediately dangerous. Her suffering makes me so damned sorrowful.\nAh me. Well\u2014give me something to look forward to.

Our town is North Crawford, New Hampshire. Herb never got to college, where he would have done well. He learned about bookkeeping and taxes by mail. Herb fought in Korea, came home a hero. And he married Sheila Hinckley, a very pretty, intelligent woman practically all the men in my particular age group had hoped to marry. My particular age group is thirty-three, thirty-four, and thirty-five years old, these days.\nOn Sheila\u2019s wedding day we were twenty-one, twenty-two, and twenty-three. On Sheila\u2019s wedding night we all went down to North Crawford Manor and drank. One poor guy got up on the bar and spoke approximately as follows:\n\u201cGentlemen, friends, brothers, I\u2019m sure we wish the newlyweds nothing but happiness. But at the same time I have to say that the pain in our hearts will never die. And I propose that we form a permanent brotherhood of eternal sufferers, to aid each other in any way we can, though Lord knows there\u2019s very little anybody can do for pain like ours.\u201d\nThe crowd thought that was a fine idea.\nHay Boyden, who later became a house mover and wrecker, said we ought to call ourselves the Brotherhood of People Who Were Too Dumb to Realize That Sheila Hinckley Might Actually Want to Be a Housewife. Hay had boozy, complicated reasons for suggesting that. Sheila had been the smartest girl in high school, and had been going like a house afire at the University of Vermont, too. We\u2019d all assumed there wasn\u2019t any point in serious courting until she\u2019d finished college.\nAnd then, right in the middle of her junior year, she\u2019d quit and married Herb.\n\u201cBrother Boyden,\u201d said the drunk up on the bar, \u201cI think that is a sterling suggestion. But in all humility I offer another title for our organization, a title in all ways inferior to yours except that it\u2019s about ten thousand times easier to say.

EPICAC wanted to talk on and on about love and such, but I was exhausted. I shut him off in the middle of a sentence.\n\"The Kiss\" turned the trick. Pat\u2019s mind was mush by the time she had finished it. She looked up from the sonnet expectantly. I cleared my throat, but no words came. I turned away, pretending to work. I couldn\u2019t propose until I had the right words from EPICAC, the perfect words.\nI had my chance when Pat stepped out of the room for a moment. Feverishly, I set EPICAC for conversation. Before I could peck out my first message, he was clicking away at a great rate. \"What\u2019s she wearing tonight?\" he wanted to know. \"Tell me exactly how she looks. Did she like the poems I wrote to her?\" He repeated the last question twice.\nIt was impossible to change the subject without answering his questions, since he could not take up a new matter without having dispensed with the problems before it. If he were given a problem to which there was no solution, he would destroy himself trying to solve it. Hastily, I told him what Pat looked like\u2014he knew the word \"stacked\"\u2014and assured him that his poems had floored her, practically, they were so beautiful. \"She wants to get married,\" I added, preparing him to bang out a brief but moving proposal.\n\"Tell me about getting married,\" he said.\nI explained this difficult matter to him in as few digits as possible.\n\"Good,\" said EPICAC. \"I\u2019m ready any time she is.\"\nThe amazing, pathetic truth dawned on me. When I thought about it, I realized that what had happened was perfectly logical, inevitable, and all my fault. I had taught EPICAC about love and about Pat. Now, automatically, he loved Pat. Sadly, I gave it to him straight: \"She loves me. She wants to marry me.\"\n\"Your poems were better than mine?\" asked EPICAC. The rhythm of his clicks was erratic, possibly peevish.\n\"I signed my name to your poems,\" I admitted. Covering up for a painful conscience, I became arrogant. \"Machines are built to serve men,\" I typed.
