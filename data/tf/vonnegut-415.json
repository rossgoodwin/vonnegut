Didn\u2019t I dedicate a book to you one time? [\u2026] I myself am all alone and as celibate as any heterosexual Roman Catholic priest, in a spiffy apartment in Northampton, the dyke capital of the world, where the only African-American resident is my boss Ruth Simmons, the president of Smith. Maybe you heard she\u2019s going to be president of Brown next year. A twofer! Her PhD is in French literature. When I was at Iowa a thousand years ago, we invited Ralph Ellison to lecture. His subject turned out to be guess what? French literature. He used to work in a slaughterhouse, and he said the best cut of beef is the strip which wraps the filet mignon. I don\u2019t eat steak anymore. A steak now looks like a great big plate of fudge. Too much! My two African-Americans at Iowa hated Invisible Man. Generation gap! Ellison collected pre-Columbian pottery. A guy is now writing a biography of Dick Yates, and he called me. I told him about the time Yates set his bed on fire, and I visited him in the burn ward at Bellevue, and he asked me for a cigarette. I asked the biographer if he had read Winnie the Pooh. He had, and I told him Dick Yates was Eeyore. Just for fun I told him what Nelson Algren said to the Chilean novelist Jose Donoso out there in Iowa: \u201cIt must be nice to come from a country that long and narrow.\u201d\nI still smoke like a house afire, having at last actually set my house afire. That\u2019s why I came up here, to be near my daughter Nanny and my three adopted nephews, while recovering from smoke inhalation. I am suing Brown & Williamson. They promised to kill me on every pack of Pall Malls, but here I am, having accepted an enormous advance from Putnam for a book I can\u2019t write. My efforts reek of ennui. Clinton\u2019s pardons cut my nuts off. It would be a tremendous relief to have supper with you and Kitty and the Harrises during Smith\u2019s spring break, which begins on the fifteenth of this month. I will be in New York and will give you a ring.\nCheers\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut\nOctober 11, 2001\n[Northampton, MA]\nTO ROBERT AND LINDA WEIDE\nBob & Linda\u2014\nIf you haven\u2019t yet screened Mother Night, explain that Campbell is a stand-in for the Germans who participated in the Holocaust, who said afterwards, \u201cAnybody who knows me knows that really wasn\u2019t the real me.\u201d\nYou might say, too, that the film has never been shown in Germany and Israel because what was said by Nazis about Jews is unbearable.
