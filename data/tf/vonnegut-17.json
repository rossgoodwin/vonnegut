I am twenty-four, married, and the father of a very young child. I will be in need of a job at that time. Would General Motors be interested in hiring a person with my qualifications?\nI was not an Anthropology student prior to the war. I took it up as part of a personal readjustment following some bewildering experiences as an infantryman and later as a prisoner of war in Dresden, Germany. The study of the Science of Man has been extremely satisfactory from that personal standpoint. It should also make me valuable to an organization such as yours, for I have considerable insight\u2014through training in cultural anthropology and social psychology\u2014into human relations, and would, with some instruction, make an able personnel or labor relations man [\u2026]\nI have had experience in other fields as a student. For three years before the war I was preparing to be a biochemist at Cornell University, with my time divided equally between chemistry and biology. For one of my three Army years I was sent to Carnegie Tech and then to the University of Tennessee for a course in Mechanical Engineering. I have no degree in Biochemistry, neither do I have one in Mechanical Engineering as the Army saw fit to terminate both courses before they were finished.\nAs to extra-curricular interests: most of my spare time at Cornell was spent in working for the Cornell Daily Sun, a corporation independent of the University, run wholly by students; an Associated Press member, an excellent daily tabloid. This was no mean job, consuming about thirty hours each week. I was made Managing Editor shortly before I was called to active duty.\nI have been offered two jobs with advertising agencies as a copy writer, two as a newspaper reporter, one as a teacher in a private school, one as a trainee in a publishing house.

It was about a Cuban fisherman who hadn\u2019t caught anything for eighty-four days. The Cuban hooked an enormous marlin. He killed it and lashed it alongside his little boat. Before he could get it to shore, though, sharks bit off all the meat on the skeleton.\nI was living in Barnstable Village on Cape Cod when the story appeared. I asked a neighboring commercial fisherman what he thought of it. He said the hero was an idiot. He should have hacked off the best chunks of meat and put them in the bottom of the boat, and left the rest of the carcass for the sharks.\nIt could be that the sharks Hemingway had in mind were critics who hadn\u2019t much liked his first novel in ten years, Across the River and into the Trees, published two years earlier. As far as I know, he never said so. But the marlin could have been that novel.\nAnd then I found myself in the winter of 1996 the creator of a novel which did not work, which had no point, which had never wanted to be written in the first place.

He was wearing field gray.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFather was living with his parents out near Shepherdstown at the time, but all his souvenirs were stored in the carriage house. And, on the day that Mother saw him in the uniform, he had begun opening trunks and packing cases, with his old mentor, August Gunther, looking on. He had put on the uniform to make Gunther laugh.\nThey came outside, lugging a table between them. They were going to have lunch in the shade of an ancient walnut tree. They had brought beer and bread and sausage and cheese and roast chicken, all of which had been produced locally. The cheese, incidentally, was Liederkranz, which most people assume is a European cheese. Liederkranz was invented in Midland City, Ohio, in about 1865.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo Father, setting down for a lusty lunch with old Gunther, was aware that a little girl was watching everything through the hedge, and he made jokes about her which she could hear. He said to Gunther that he had been away so long that he could no longer remember the names of American birds. There was a bird in the hedge there, he said, and he described Mother as though she were a bird, and he asked old Gunther what to call the bird.\nAnd Father approached the supposed little bird with a piece of bread in his hand, asking if little birds like her ate bread, and Mother fled into her parents\u2019 house.\nShe told me this.

rubbed his smarting eyes and brought into focus the face of Hope, who was rocking from side to side with laughter. He felt utterly humiliated standing before her, comical in his weakness, and in his clothing\u2014cast-off work clothes of the General, too short, too wide, high on his ankles and wrists, bunched at his waist. Exhaustion and sudden loneliness billowed in his narrow breast. He sank to the ground again.\nThe General eased himself down from his perch and stood over him, kicking gently at the soles of his shoes and chiding, \u201cCome on, boy, get up. All right, get up.\u201d Haley stood. The General seemed more embarrassed than angry. \u201cThat\u2019s enough of that,\u201d he said. \u201cMooning and malingering will get you nowhere around here, do you understand? I\u2019m ashamed of you.\u201d\n\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Haley heard Hope call.\nBlushing and apologizing in half-soliloquy, Haley clambered atop the wagon, unable to look at Hope. Mr. Banghart swung three more bales up to Hope, and the wagon moved, jolting and creaking, toward the barnyard.\nIn the still, dry heat of the loft, under a tin roof too hot to touch, Hope, Haley, and Mr. Banghart dragged bale after bale from the wagon over the splintered floor to a growing stack deep in the shadows of one end. The General remained on the wagon to steady the horses. Tormenting himself, Haley tried to imagine what the others were thinking of him. Hope was the only one he really cared about. The two of them worked together, their hooks driven into the same bale. She said nothing, concentrating her attention on the hard work to be done. He was bewildered by the effect her presence had had upon him since the first instant he had seen her. He now found her more beautiful than ever, with her hair lightened by dust, and with heat bringing her loose clothes into conformity with the lines of her young figure.\nMr. Banghart rolled a cigarette, politely excused himself, and went out into the barnyard to smoke it. The General joined him with a cigar, leaving Haley and Hope alone in the barn. Haley sat down on a bale next to Hope. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019ll get used to farmwork after a while,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all did. Takes about a month.\u201d\nFor want of a rational comment on this message, Haley changed the subject. \u201cMr. Banghart is a funny one,\u201d he said. \u201cI never knew anyone to talk to himself so much.\u201d\nHope giggled. \u201cHe\u2019s got a screw loose, all right, but the General says he\u2019s the best worker we ever had on the farm,\u201d she said. \u201cTry and hear what he talks to himself about sometime. It\u2019s all about what he\u2019s going to do to people he thinks are out to get him\u2014which is practically everybody. You\u2019re lucky\u2014he liked you right away, and that\u2019s unusual.\u201d She became more thoughtful. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t laugh. It\u2019s kind of sad about him, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cHas he ever done anything to anybody?\u201d asked Haley uneasily.\n\u201cOh, no, he just talks about it. He has one of the tenants\u2019 houses all to himself, and he spends most of his spare time there. He never goes into town, and the General has him working by himself, or with us, so there isn\u2019t much chance for him to get into trouble with anybody.\u201d", 0.1272424954500426], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["hope", 0.04], ["haley", 0.04], ["banghart", 0.04], ["wouldn", 0.015], ["tunnel", 0.015], ["blade", 0.015], ["corner", 0.01], ["break", 0.01], ["walls", 0.01], ["knife", 0.01], ["job", 0.01], ["place", 0.01], ["secret", 0.01], ["sheath", 0.01], ["sat", 0.01], ["floor", 0.01], ["hand", 0.01], ["thought", 0.01], ["emerging", 0.005], ["managed", 0.005], ["agreed", 0.005], ["wishing", 0.005], ["stride", 0.005], ["bright", 0.005], ["questioningly", 0.005], ["skin", 0.005], ["rough", 0.005], ["shrugged", 0.005], ["fine", 0.005], ["find", 0.005], ["flashlight", 0.005], ["hunting", 0.005], ["continued", 0.005], ["passage", 0.005], ["better", 0.005], ["struck", 0.005], ["save", 0.005], ["good", 0.005], ["worse", 0.005], ["blinking", 0.005], ["anger", 0.005], ["hallucinations", 0.005], ["fear", 0.005], ["bringing", 0.005], ["quizzed", 0.005], ["shoulder", 0.005], ["leather", 0.005], ["shock", 0.005], ["laughing", 0.005], ["night", 0.005], ["soft", 0.005], ["shave", 0.005], ["cry", 0.005], ["farthest", 0.005], ["driving", 0.005], ["observed", 0.005], ["reached", 0.005], ["casual", 0.005], ["gently", 0.005], ["surfaces", 0.005], ["stood", 0.005], ["appear", 0.005], ["disbelief", 0.005], ["defend", 0.005], ["finger", 0.005], ["emerged", 0.005], ["racing", 0.005], ["ladder", 0.005], ["whispered", 0.005], ["nudged", 0.005], ["remembered", 0.005], ["drew", 0.005], ["hours", 0.005], ["monotony", 0.005], ["affectionately", 0.005], ["splintery", 0.005], ["discomfort", 0.005], ["times", 0.005], ["thing", 0.005], ["length", 0.005], ["annie", 0.005], ["settled", 0.005], ["silence", 0.005], ["quietly", 0.005], ["yards", 0.005], ["slipped", 0.005], ["dammed", 0.005], ["jabbed", 0.005], ["passageway", 0.005], ["twisted", 0.005], ["murmured", 0.005], ["likes", 0.005], ["whispering", 0.005], ["thoughtfully", 0.005], ["thick", 0.005], ["stare", 0.005], ["impressed", 0.005], ["breathless", 0.005], ["spoke", 0.005], ["caught", 0.005], ["three", 0.005], ["long", 0.005], ["slowly", 0.005], ["realization", 0.005], ["legs", 0.005], ["scratched", 0.005], ["eyes", 0.005], ["bit", 0.005], ["loft", 0.005], ["started", 0.005], ["proudly", 0.005], ["wisdom", 0.005], ["released", 0.005], ["moistened", 0.005], ["broke", 0.005], ["fellow", 0.005], ["effort", 0.005], ["glad", 0.005], ["flecks", 0.005], ["double", 0.005], ["inside", 0.005], ["plunged", 0.005], ["architect", 0.005], ["faded", 0.005], ["knocked", 0.005], ["making", 0.005], ["voice", 0.005], ["minutes", 0.005], ["crazy", 0.005], ["wriggled", 0.005], ["honed", 0.005], ["general", 0.005], ["heard", 0.005], ["sudden", 0.005], ["frantic", 0.005], ["ready", 0.005], ["sharp", 0.005], ["leaving", 0.005], ["looked", 0.005], ["strength", 0.005], ["shirt", 0.005], ["fascination", 0.005], ["amusing", 0.005], ["corridor", 0.005], ["badly", 0.005], ["play", 0.005], ["edged", 0.005], ["digesting", 0.005], ["bale", 0.005], ["running", 0.005], ["smiled", 0.005], ["supper", 0.005], ["darkness", 0.005], ["undisturbed", 0.005], ["light", 0.005], ["builder", 0.005], ["seconds", 0.005], ["bang", 0.005], ["edge", 0.005], ["budge", 0.005], ["order", 0.005]], "sentiment": ["Hope emerged from the passage as he stood blinking in disbelief. \u201cThis is one place the General and Annie can never find you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be times when you\u2019ll be glad there is such a place.\u201d She sat down in a corner. \u201cIt was just a crazy thing to do to break the monotony, but it\u2019s a good job, if I do say so myself. I\u2019m the architect; Mr. Banghart\u2019s the builder. Like it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fine job,\u201d said Haley, impressed.\n\u201cA fellow likes to get away from it all now and then,\u201d Mr. Banghart observed thoughtfully. They sat in silence for a few minutes, digesting this wisdom. Mr. Banghart spoke up again. \u201cWant to know another secret?\u201d he whispered. There was no need for whispering, Haley thought, with the walls three yards thick.\n\u201cCertainly we want to know another secret,\u201d said Hope. \u201cLet\u2019s have it.\u201d\nMr. Banghart reached inside his faded shirt, bringing forth a long leather sheath. He drew from the sheath a double-edged hunting knife, with a blade the length of his hand. He twisted it before his eyes slowly, affectionately, Haley thought, and its bright surfaces sent flecks of light racing along the walls. \u201cIt\u2019s so sharp I can shave with it,\u201d he said, running a moistened finger over the edge. \u201cHoned it for two hours last night.\u201d He smiled proudly. \u201cNow I\u2019m ready for anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really use it on somebody,\u201d said Haley, making an effort to appear as undisturbed by the knife as Hope seemed to be. Though he managed to keep his voice casual, he was wishing that he had not settled in the corner farthest from the tunnel, with Mr. Banghart between him and the outside world.\n\u201cOh, wouldn\u2019t I use it, though?\u201d said Mr. Banghart. He jabbed the blade into a bale. \u201cWouldn\u2019t I, though? Let me tell you something, Haley: If they want to play rough, so can I.\u201d\nHaley looked questioningly at Hope, and caught her laughing quietly at his discomfort. He remembered that when he had quizzed her about Mr. Banghart\u2019s hallucinations of a world out to get him, she had shrugged them off as being amusing and nothing more. \u201cI think we\u2019d better go to supper,\u201d Haley murmured.\nHope agreed, and started for the tunnel. Mr. Banghart did not budge, but continued to stare at the blade. Hope nudged him gently to break his fascination. The flashlight slipped from his hand to bang on the floor and go out.\nThe shock of sudden darkness released Haley\u2019s dammed-up fear. He plunged toward the tunnel, driving with every bit of strength in his legs. His shoulder struck something soft, and he heard Hope cry out in anger. He wriggled into the passageway, and made his way to the corridor in a few seconds, emerging breathless and badly scratched by the splintery floor. He was almost to the loft ladder before realization of what he had done broke his frantic stride. Worse than leaving Hope to defend herself, he had knocked her aside in order to save his own skin.", 0.09827327327327329], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["der",

Der gute Sakristan deutete mir alsdann auf Ruinene nach allen Seiten und sagte bedenklich lakonisch: Das hat der Feind gethan!\u201d\nThe two little girls and I crossed the Delaware River where George Washington had crossed it, the next morning. We went to the New York World\u2019s Fair, saw what the past had been like, according to the Ford Motor Car Company and Walt Disney, saw what the future would be like, according to General Motors.\nAnd I asked myself about the present: how wide it was, how deep it was, how much was mine to keep.\nI taught creative writing in the famous Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa for a couple of years after that. I got into some perfectly beautiful trouble, got out of it again. I taught in the afternoons. In the mornings I wrote. I was not to be disturbed. I was working on my famous book about Dresden.\nAnd somewhere in there a nice man named Seymour Lawrence gave me a three-book contract, and I said, \u201cO.K., the first of the three will be my famous book about Dresden.\u201d\nThe friends of Seymour Lawrence call him \u201cSam.\u201d And I say to Sam now: \u201cSam\u2014here\u2019s the book.\u201d\nIt is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.

It would be five more sundowns before her engines quit forever, and ten more years before she sank to the ocean floor. She was not only the newest and largest and fastest and most luxurious cruise ship based in Guayaquil. She was the only one designed specifically for the Gal\u00e1pagos tourist trade, whose destiny, from the moment her keel was laid, was understood to be a steady churning out to the islands and back again, out to the islands and back again.\nShe was built in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, where I myself worked on her. It was said by the skeleton crew of Swedes and Ecuadorians who delivered her from Malm\u00f6 to Guayaquil that a storm she passed through in the North Atlantic would be the last rough water or cold weather she would ever know.\nShe was a floating restaurant and lecture hall and nightclub and hotel for one hundred paying guests. She had radar and sonar, and an electronic navigator which gave continuously her position on the face of the earth, to the nearest hundred meters. She was so thoroughly automated that a person all alone on the bridge, with no one in the engine room or on deck, could start her up, hoist her anchor, put her in gear, and drive her off like a family automobile. She had eighty-five flush toilets and twelve bidets, and telephones in the staterooms and on the bridge which, via satellite, could reach other telephones anywhere.\nShe had television, so people could keep up with the news of the day.\nHer owners, a pair of old German brothers in Quito, boasted that their ship would never be out of touch with the rest of the world for an instant. Little did they know.\nShe was seventy meters long.\nThe ship on which Charles Darwin was the unpaid naturalist, the Beagle, was only twenty-eight meters long.\nWhen the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was launched in Malm\u00f6, eleven hundred metric tons of saltwater had to find someplace else to go. I was dead by then.\nWhen the Beagle was launched in Falmouth, England, only two hundred and fifteen metric tons of saltwater had to find someplace else to go.", 0.014166666666666662], "title":

too late. I am no longer interested.\u201d\n\u201cNever is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day,\u201d he might say. These, of course, are words from the American song \u201cHome on the Range,\u201d which he had translated into Armenian. He found them idiotic.\n\u201cTolstoi made shoes,\u201d he might say. This was a fact, of course: the greatest of Russian writers and idealists had, in an effort to do work that mattered, made shoes for a little while. May I say that I, too, could make shoes if I had to.\nCirce Berman says she can make pants if she has to. As she would tell me when we met on the beach, her father had a pants factory in Lackawanna, New York, until he went bankrupt and hanged himself.\nIf my father had managed to survive Captains Courageous, starring Spencer Tracy and Freddie Bartholomew, and had lived to see the paintings I did after the war, several of which drew serious critical attention, and a few of which I sold for what was quite a bit of money back then, he surely would have been among the great American majority which snorted and jeered at them. He wouldn\u2019t have razzed just me. He would have razzed my Abstract Expressionist pals, too, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko and Terry Kitchen and so on, painters who are now, unlike myself, acknowledged to be some of the most brilliant artists ever to have been produced not just by the United States but by the whole damn world. But what sticks in my mind like a thorn now, and I haven\u2019t thought about this for years: he would have had no hesitation in razzing his own son, in razzing me.\nSo, thanks to the conversation Mrs. Berman struck up with me on the beach only two weeks ago, I am in a frenzy of adolescent resentment against a father who was buried almost fifty years ago! Let me off this hellish time machine!\nBut there is no getting off this hellish time machine. I have to think now, even though it is the last I would ever want to think about, if I had a choice, that my own father would have laughed as hard as anybody when my paintings, thanks to unforeseen chemical reactions between the sizing of my canvases and the acrylic wall-paint and colored tapes I had applied to them, all destroyed themselves.\nI mean\u2014people who had paid fifteen-or twenty-or even thirty thousand dollars for a picture of mine found themselves gazing at a blank canvas, all ready for a new picture, and ringlets of colored tapes and what looked like moldy Rice Krispies on the floor.\nIt was a postwar miracle that did me in. I had better explain to my young readers, if any, that the Second World War had many of the promised characteristics of Armageddon, a final war between good and evil, so that nothing would do but that it be followed by miracles. Instant coffee was one. DDT was another. It was going to kill all the bugs, and almost did. Nuclear energy was going to make electricity so cheap that it might not even be metered. It would also make another war unthinkable. Talk about loaves and fishes! Antibiotics would defeat all diseases. Lazarus would never die: How was that for a scheme to make the Son of God obsolete?\nYes, and there were miraculous breakfast foods and would soon be helicopters for every family. There were miraculous new fibers which could be washed in cold water and need no ironing afterwards!

Wave flags if you have them. That always seems to scare them away. I\u2019m kidding.\nIf you want to really hurt your parents, and you don\u2019t have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I\u2019m not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven\u2019s sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.\nI want to share with you something I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019ll draw it on the blackboard behind me so you can follow more easily [draws a vertical line on the blackboard]. This is the G-I axis: good fortune\u2014ill fortune. Death and terrible poverty, sickness down here\u2014great prosperity, wonderful health up there. Your average state of affairs here in the middle [points to bottom, top, and middle of line respectively].\nThis is the B-E axis. B for beginning, E for entropy. Okay. Not every story has that very simple, very pretty shape that even a computer can understand [draws horizontal line extending from middle of G-I axis].\nNow let me give you a marketing tip. The people who can afford to buy books and magazines and go to the movies don\u2019t like to hear about people who are poor or sick, so start your story up here [indicates top of the G-I axis]. You will see this story over and over again. People love it and it is not copyrighted. The story is \u201cMan in Hole,\u201d but the story needn\u2019t be about a man or a hole. It\u2019s: Somebody gets into trouble, gets out of it again [draws line A]. It is not accidental that the line ends up higher than where it began. This is encouraging to readers.\nAnother is called \u201cBoy Meets Girl,\u201d but this needn\u2019t be about a boy meeting a girl [begins drawing line B]. It\u2019s: Somebody, an ordinary person, on a day like any other day, comes across something perfectly wonderful: \u201cOh boy, this is my lucky day!\u201d \u2026 [drawing line downward]. \u201cShit!\u201d \u2026 [drawing line back up again]. And gets back up again.\nNopagew, I don\u2019t mean to intimidate you, but after being a chemist as an undergraduate at Cornell, after the war I went to the University of Chicago and studied anthropology, and eventually I took a masters degree in that field. Saul Bellow was in that same department, and neither one of us ever made a field trip. Although we certainly imagined some. I started going to the library in search of reports about ethnographers, preachers, and explorers\u2014those imperialists\u2014to find out what sorts of stories they\u2019d collected from primitive people. It was a big mistake for me to take a degree in anthropology anyway, because I can\u2019t stand primitive people\u2014they\u2019re so stupid. But anyway, I read these stories, one after another, collected from primitive people all over the world, and they were dead level, like the B-E axis here. So all right. Primitive people deserve to lose with their lousy stories. They really are backward. Look at the wonderful rise and fall of our stories.\nOne of the most popular stories ever told starts down here [begins line C below B-E axis]. Who is this person who\u2019s despondent? She\u2019s a girl of about fifteen or sixteen whose mother has died, so why wouldn\u2019t she be low? And her father got married almost immediately to a terrible battle-axe with two mean daughters. You\u2019ve heard it?\nThere\u2019s to be a party at the palace. She has to help her two stepsisters and her dreadful stepmother get ready to go, but she herself has to stay home. Is she even sadder now? No, she\u2019s already a broken-hearted little girl. The death of her mother is enough. Things can\u2019t get any worse than that. So okay, they all leave for the party. Her fairy godmother shows up [draws incremental rise], gives her pantyhose, mascara, and a means of transportation to get to the party.\nAnd when she shows up she\u2019s the belle of the ball [draws line upward]. She is so heavily made up that her relatives don\u2019t even recognize her. Then the clock strikes twelve, as promised, and it\u2019s all taken away again [draws line downward]. It doesn\u2019t take long for a clock to strike twelve times, so she drops down. Does she drop down to the same level? Hell, no. No matter what happens after that she\u2019ll remember when the prince was in love with her and she was the belle of the ball. So she poops along, at her considerably improved level, no matter what, and the shoe fits, and she becomes off-scale happy [draws line upward and then infinity symbol].", 0.0365341970121382], "title":

I discussed that some at a fund raiser for the American Civil Liberties Union at Sands Point, New York, out on Long Island, on September 16, 1979. The house where I spoke, incidentally, was said to be the model for Gatsby\u2019s house in F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s The Great Gatsby. I saw no reason to doubt the claim.\nI said this in such a setting:\n\u201cI will not speak directly to the ejection of my book Slaughterhouse-Five from the school libraries of Island Trees. I have a vested interest. I wrote the book, after all, so why wouldn\u2019t I argue, that it is less repulsive than the school board says?\n\u201cI will speak of Thomas Aquinas instead. I will tell you my dim memories of what he said about the hierarchy of laws on this planet, which was flat at the time. The highest law, he said, was divine law, God\u2019s law. Beneath that was natural law, which I suppose would include thunderstorms, and our right to shield our children from poisonous ideas, and so on.\n\u201cAnd the lowest law was human law.\n\u201cLet me clarify this scheme by comparing its parts to playing cards. Enemies of the Bill of Rights do the same sort of thing all the time, so why shouldn\u2019t we? Divine law, then, is an ace. Natural law is a king. The Bill of Rights is a lousy queen.\n\u201cThe Thomist hierarchy of laws is so far from being ridiculous that I have never met anybody who did not believe in it right down to the marrow of his or her bones. Everybody knows that there are laws with more grandeur than those which are printed in our statute books. The big trouble is that there is so little agreement as to how those grander laws are worded. Theologians can give us hints of the wording, but it takes a dictator to set them down just right\u2014to dot the t\u2019s and cross the i\u2019s. A man who had been a mere corporal in the army did that for Germany and then for all of Europe, you may remember, not long ago. There was nothing he did not know about divine and natural law. He had fistfuls of aces and kings to play.\n\u201cMeanwhile, over on this side of the Atlantic, we were not playing with a full deck, as they say. Because of our Constitution, the highest card anybody had to play was a lousy queen, contemptible human law. That remains true today. I myself celebrate that incompleteness, since it has obviously been so good for us. I support the American Civil Liberties Union because it goes to court to insist that our government officials be guided by nothing grander than human law. Every time the circulation of this idea or that one is discouraged by an official in this country, that official is scorning the Constitution, and urging all of us to participate in far grander systems, again: divine or natural law.\n\u201cCannot we, as libertarians, hunger for at least a little natural law? Can\u2019t we learn from nature at least, without being burdened by another person\u2019s idea of God?", 0.016775676014806448], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["jenny", 0.0707070707070707], ["george", 0.04040404040404041], ["van", 0.030303030303030304], ["button", 0.030303030303030304], ["sully", 0.030303030303030304], ["pushed", 0.020202020202020204], ["equipment", 0.020202020202020204], ["going", 0.020202020202020204], ["telephoning", 0.020202020202020204], ["magic", 0.020202020202020204], ["left", 0.020202020202020204], ["shoes", 0.020202020202020204], ["leave", 0.020202020202020204], ["time", 0.020202020202020204], ["fuh", 0.020202020202020204], ["point", 0.010101010101010102], ["nerve", 0.010101010101010102], ["dedicated", 0.010101010101010102], ["office", 0.010101010101010102], ["sentence", 0.010101010101010102], ["scared", 0.010101010101010102], ["sense", 0.010101010101010102], ["vans", 0.010101010101010102], ["valuable", 0.010101010101010102], ["years", 0.010101010101010102], ["shoe", 0.010101010101010102], ["picked", 0.010101010101010102], ["wasn", 0.010101010101010102], ["petered", 0.010101010101010102], ["help", 0.010101010101010102], ["thought", 0.010101010101010102], ["sonny", 0.010101010101010102], ["inside", 0.010101010101010102], ["slipped", 0.010101010101010102], ["accordion", 0.010101010101010102], ["deadpan", 0.010101010101010102], ["god", 0.010101010101010102], ["jim", 0.010101010101010102], ["excitement", 0.010101010101010102], ["fast", 0.010101010101010102], ["better", 0.010101010101010102], ["sneakers", 0.010101010101010102], ["employee", 0.010101010101010102], ["perfectly", 0.010101010101010102], ["worth", 0.010101010101010102], ["told", 0.010101010101010102], ["head", 0.010101010101010102], ["transportation", 0.010101010101010102], ["mona", 0.010101010101010102], ["arguing", 0.010101010101010102], ["brains", 0.010101010101010102], ["company", 0.010101010101010102], ["hand", 0.010101010101010102], ["famous", 0.010101010101010102], ["reason", 0.010101010101010102], ["harris", 0.010101010101010102], ["moving", 0.010101010101010102], ["smiled", 0.010101010101010102], ["lisa", 0.010101010101010102], ["pair", 0.010101010101010102], ["minute", 0.010101010101010102], ["stiff", 0.010101010101010102], ["dollars", 0.010101010101010102], ["buttons", 0.010101010101010102], ["drive", 0.010101010101010102], ["called", 0.010101010101010102], ["weren", 0.010101010101010102], ["fatheaded", 0.010101010101010102], ["suggestion", 0.010101010101010102], ["push", 0.010101010101010102], ["cab", 0.010101010101010102], ["quarter", 0.010101010101010102], ["straight", 0.010101010101010102], ["shook", 0.010101010101010102]], "sentiment": ["\u201cAnd leave the van?\u201d George said.

He asked Ma Jarvis what she planned to do next.\nThere was nothing much that she could do next, of course. The strikers weren\u2019t even strikers anymore, but simply unemployed persons being turned out of their homes.\nShe gave a brave answer anyway: \u201cWe will be back,\u201d she said. What else could she say?\nHe asked her when they would be back.\nHer answer was probably no more than the poetry of hopelessness in Christendom, with winter setting in. \u201cOn Christmas morning,\u201d she said.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis was printed in the paper, whose editors felt that a threatening promise had been made. And the fame of this coming Christmas in Cleveland spread far and wide. Sympathizers with the strikers\u2014preachers, writers, union organizers, populist politicians, and on and on\u2014began to filter into the city as though expecting a miracle of some kind. They were frankly enemies of the economic order as it was constructed then.\nA company of National Guard infantrymen was mobilized by Edwin Kincaid, the governor of Ohio, to protect the factory. They were farm boys from the southern part of the state, selected because they had no friends or relatives among the strikers, no reason to see them as anything but unreasonable disturbers of the peace. They represented an American ideal: healthy, cheerful citizen soldiers, who went about their ordinary business until their country suddenly needed an awesome display of weapons and discipline. They were supposed to appear as though from nowhere, to the consternation of America\u2019s enemies. When the trouble was over, they would vanish again.\nThe regular army of the country, which had fought the Indians until the Indians could fight no more, was down to about thirty thousand men.

nowadays, in the year 2001, are still called \u201cstogies\u201d sometimes, which is short for \u201cConestoga.\u201d\nBy 1830, the sturdiest and most popular of these wagons were in fact made by the Mohiga Wagon Company right here in Scipio, New York, at the pinched waist of Lake Mohiga, the deepest and coldest and westernmost of the long and narrow Finger Lakes. So sophisticated cigar-smokers might want to stop calling their stinkbombs \u201cstogies\u201d and call them \u201cmogies\u201d or \u201chiggies\u201d instead.\nTHE FOUNDER OF the Mohiga Wagon Company was Aaron Tarkington, a brilliant inventor and manufacturer who nevertheless could not read or write. He now would be identified as a blameless inheritor of the genetic defect known as dyslexia. He said of himself that he was like the Emperor Charlemagne, \u201ctoo busy to learn to read and write.\u201d He was not too busy, however, to have his wife read to him for 2 hours every evening. He had an excellent memory, for he delivered weekly lectures to the workmen at the factory that were laced with lengthy quotations from Shakespeare and Homer and the Bible, and on and on.\nHe sired 4 children, a son and 3 daughters, all of whom could read and write. But they still carried the gene of dyslexia, which would disqualify several of their own descendants from getting very far in conventional schemes of education. Two of Aaron Tarkington\u2019s children were so far from being dyslexic, in fact, as to themselves write books, which I have read only now, and which nobody, probably, will ever read again. Aaron\u2019s only son, Elias, wrote a technical account of the construction of the Onondaga Canal, which connected the northern end of Lake Mohiga to the Erie Canal just south of Rochester. And the youngest daughter, Felicia, wrote a novel called Carpathia, about a head-strong, high-born young woman in the Mohiga Valley who fell in love with a half-Indian lock-tender on that same canal.\nTHAT CANAL IS all filled in and paved over now, and is Route 53, which forks at the head of the lake, where the locks used to be. One fork leads southwest through farm country to Scipio. The other leads southeast through the perpetual gloom of the Iroquois National Forest to the bald hilltop crowned by the battlements of the New York State Maximum Security Adult Correctional Institution at Athena, a hamlet directly across the lake from Scipio.\nBear with me. This is history. I am trying to explain how this valley, this verdant cul-de-sac, got to be what it is today.\nALL 3 OF Aaron Tarkington\u2019s daughters married into prosperous and enterprising families in Cleveland, New York, and Wilmington, Delaware\u2014innocently making the threat of dyslexia pandemic in an emerging ruling class of bankers and industrialists, largely displaced in my time by Germans, Koreans, Italians, English, and, of course, Japanese.\nThe son of Aaron, Elias, remained in Scipio and took over his father\u2019s properties, adding to them a brewery and a steam-driven carpet factory, the first such in the state. There was no water power in Scipio, whose industrial prosperity until the introduction of steam was based not on cheap energy and locally available raw materials but on inventiveness and high standards of workmanship.\nElias Tarkington never married. He was severely wounded at the age of 54 while a civilian observer at the Battle of Gettysburg, top hat and all. He was there to see the debuts of 2 of his inventions, a mobile field kitchen and a pneumatic recoil mechanism for heavy artillery. The field kitchen, incidentally, with slight modifications, would later be adopted by the Barnum & Bailey Circus, and then by the German Army during World War I.\nELIAS TARKINGTON WAS a tall and skinny man with chin whiskers and a stovepipe hat.
