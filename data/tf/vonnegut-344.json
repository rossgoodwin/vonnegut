Not just male writers, but male artists of every sort, are no longer pressured to prove that they are real men, even though they have artistic sensibilities. As I\u2019ve said elsewhere, my father was a gun nut like Ernest Hemingway, mainly to prove that he wasn\u2019t effeminate, even though he was an architect and a painter. He didn\u2019t get drunk and slug people. Shooting animals was enough.\nBut male American artists don\u2019t even have to shoot off guns anymore. They can even be homosexuals, and the hell with it. This is good.\nIt is also good, which is to say intelligent and humane, that we are much politer to people of other races and sub-races than we used to be, and even to the animals, what\u2019s left of them, which my father and Hemingway used to [kill].\nKurt Vonnegut\nOctober 24, 1989\nNew York City\nTO MARC LEEDS\nMarc Leeds is author of The Vonnegut Encyclopedia: An Authorized Compendium, and editor of The Vonnegut Chronicles: Interviews and Essays.\nDear Marc\u2014\nI\u2019m relieved to hear from you after all this time.
