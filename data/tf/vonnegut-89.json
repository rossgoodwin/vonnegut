This was a very popular novel published in 1933, one year after my peephole opened. It told of a tiny, isolated country, a secret from the rest of the world, where no one ever tried to hurt anybody else, and where everybody was happy and nobody grew old. Hilton located this imaginary Garden of Eden somewhere in the Himalayas, and he called it \u201cShangri-La.\u201d\nIt was this book which inspired John Fortune to take off for the Himalayas after his wife died. It was possible back then for even an educated person, which Fortune wasn\u2019t, to suspect that contentment might be hidden somewhere on the map, like the treasure of Captain Kidd. Katmandu had certainly been visited by travelers often enough, but they all had to get there the way John Fortune got there, which was on a footpath from the Indian border\u2014through mountains and jungle. A road wasn\u2019t put through until 1952, the year I graduated from pharmacy school.\nAnd, my God, they\u2019ve got a big airport there now. It can handle jets. My dentist, Herb Stacks, has been there three times so far, and his waiting room is chock-a-block with Nepalese art. That was how he and his family escaped the neutron bomb.

He hadn\u2019t seen Europe or combat yet. This was still in the days of steam locomotives.\nBilly had to change trains a lot. All the trains were slow. The coaches stunk of coal smoke and rationed tobacco and rationed booze and the farts of people eating wartime food. The upholstery of the iron seats was bristly, and Billy couldn\u2019t sleep much. He got to sleep soundly when he was only three hours from Ilium, with his legs splayed toward the entrance of the busy dining car.\nThe porter woke him up when the train reached Ilium. Billy staggered off with his duffel bag, and then he stood on the station platform next to the porter, trying to wake up.\n\u201cHave a good nap, did you?\u201d said the porter.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Billy.\n\u201cMan,\u201d said the porter, \u201cyou sure had a hard-on.\u201d\nAt three in the morning on Billy\u2019s morphine night in prison, a new patient was carried into the hospital by two lusty Englishmen. He was tiny. He was Paul Lazzaro, the polka-dotted car thief from Cicero, Illinois. He had been caught stealing cigarettes from under the pillow of an Englishman.

Franz Joseph and King Louis looking on, the Prince, one of several claimants to the throne of Yugoslavia, warned \u201cJimmy\u201d not to touch any part of his body or clothing, save for the sash around his neck. He would experience orgasm, but \u201cJimmy\u201d was not to attempt to enhance that event with his mouth or hands. \u201cI am not a homosexual,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve hired you as a sort of valet\u2014not as a prostitute.\n\u201cThis may be hard for you to believe, Jimmy,\u201d he went on, \u201cif you lead the kind of life I think you lead, but this is a spiritual experience for me, so keep it spiritual. Otherwise: no hundred-dollar tip. Do I make myself clear? I am an unusual man.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t tell Wait about it, but his big brain put on quite a movie for him while he was unconscious. It showed him one end of a writhing piece of blue tubing, about five meters in diameter, big enough to drive a truck through, and lit up inside like the funnel of a tornado. It did not roar like a tornado, however. Instead, unearthly music, as though from a glass harmonica, came from the far end, which appeared to be about fifty meters away. Depending on how the tube twisted, Prince Richard could catch glimpses of the opening in the far end, a golden dot and hints of greenery.\nThis, of course, was the tunnel into the Afterlife.\nSo Wait put a small rubber ball into the mouth of this would-be liberator of the Yugoslavs, as he had been told to do, and sealed the mouth with a precut piece of adhesive tape which had been stuck to a bedpost.\nThen he strangled the Prince, cutting off the blood supply to his big brain and the air supply to his lungs. Instead of counting slowly to twenty after the Prince lost consciousness and had his orgasm and saw the writhing tube, he counted slowly to three hundred instead. That was five minutes.\nIt was Wait\u2019s big brain\u2019s idea. It wasn\u2019t anything he himself had particularly wanted to do.\nIf he had ever been brought to trial for the murder, or the manslaughter, or whatever the government chose to call his crime, he would probably have pleaded temporary insanity. He would have claimed that his big brain simply wasn\u2019t working right at the time.

something I am unable to do. They may even see comedy in his tragic and foolish belief that he is totally responsible for the happiness or unhappiness of the members of his tiny family.\nThey may even see some nobility in him as an old soldier who has been brought to emotional ruin at last by the aging process and civilian life.\nAs for myself: I can\u2019t crack a smile when he says, ostensibly about the positions in which he sleeps, \u201cI have exchanged the position of the fetus for the position of the corpse.\u201d And I am so anxious for Slocum to say something good about life that I read hope into lines meant to be supremely ironical, such as when he says this: \u201cI know at last what I want to be when I grow up. When I grow up I want to be a little boy.\u201d\nWhat is perhaps Slocum\u2019s most memorable speech mourns not his own generation but the one after his, in the person of his sullen, teen-age daughter. \u201cThere was a cheerful baby girl in a high chair in my house once,\u201d he says, \u201cwho ate and drank with a hearty appetite and laughed a lot with spontaneous zest; she isn\u2019t here now, and there is no trace of her anywhere.\u201d\nWe keep reading this overly long book, even though there is no rise and fall in passion and language, because it is structured as a suspense novel. The puzzle which seduces us is this one: Which of several possible tragedies will result from so much unhappiness? The author picks a good one.\nI say that this is the most memorable, and therefore the most permanent variation on a familiar theme, and that it says baldly what the other variations only implied, what the other variations tried with desperate sentimentality not to imply: That many lives, judged by the standards of the people who live them, are simply not worth living.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWas it unethical of me to review a book by a friend of mine for The New York Times? I did not know Heller all that well back then. We had taught at City College together, and had exchanged greetings in the halls. If I had known him well, I would have refused the assignment.\nBut then, after I accepted it, I rented a summer house close to his on Long Island\u2014and I got to know him better and better at precisely the time I was reviewing Something Happened.

Harve wondered what had been shot at\u2014or shot.\nFew cars moved in Ilium. And even rarer were people on foot. Two silent, shabby lovers passed within a few feet of Harve without seeing him.\nA lurching drunk did see Harve, murmured some quizzical insult, lurched on.\nNow a siren wailed\u2014and then another, and yet another. Patrol cars were fanning out from the Ilium Police Station, idiotically advertising themselves with noise and lights.\nOne car set up a noisy, flashy roadblock not far from Harve. It blocked an underpass through the high, black rampart of a railroad bed. That much of what the police were doing was intelligent, because the car made a deadend of the route that Harve had been taking.\nThe railroad bed loomed like the Great Wall of China to Harve. Beyond it lay what he thought of as freedom. He had to think of freedom as being something close, as being just one short rush away. Actually, on the other side of the black rampart lay more of Ilium\u2014more faint lights and broken streets. Hope, real hope, lay far, far beyond\u2014lay miles beyond, lay on a superhighway, the fast, clean realm of the State Police.\nBut Harve now had to pretend that passing over or through the rampart was all that remained for him to do.\nHe crept to the railroad bed, moved along its cindery face, moved away from the underpass that the police had blocked.\nHe found himself approaching yet another underpass that was blocked by a car. He could hear talk. He recognized the voice of the talker. It was the voice of Captain Luby.\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother taking this guy alive,\u201d the captain said. \u201cHe\u2019s no good to himself or anybody else alive.

And the baby got a Government Bond worth fifty thousand dollars at maturity, and a bassinet and a stroller and free diaper service and on and on. But then she died when she was only six weeks old. The doctor who helped her into the world was in Bermuda at the time, and he did not hear about her death there. Her death was no more big news there, or anywhere outside of New York City, than her birth had been. It wasn\u2019t big news here, either, since nobody but the promoters of the asinine contest and the business people who had donated the prizes took all the hoopla about her at all seriously, the blather about her representing so many wonderful things, the mingling of races in beauty and happiness, the rebirth of the spirit which had once made New York the greatest city in the world in the greatest nation in the world, and just plain peace, and I don\u2019t know what all. It seems to me now that she was like an unknown soldier in a war memorial, a little bit of flesh and bone and hair which was extolled to the point of lunacy. Hardly anybody came to her funeral, incidentally. The TV station whose idea the contest was sent a minor executive, not even a personality, and surely not a camera crew. Who wants to watch the burial of the next thousand years? If television refuses to look at something, it is as though it never happened. It can erase anything, even whole continents, such as Africa, one big desert now, where millions upon millions of babies, with a brand-new thousand years of history looming before them, starve to death. It was Crib Death Syndrome which killed our daughter, they say. This is a genetic defect as yet, and perhaps forever, undetectable by amniocentesis. She was our first child. Ah me.\nSpoils\nIf, on Judgment Day, God were to ask Paul which of the two should rightly be his eternal residence, Heaven or Hell, Paul would likely suggest that, by his own and by Cosmic standards, Hell was his destiny\u2014recalling the wretched thing he had done. The Almighty, in all His Wisdom, might recognize that Paul\u2019s life on the whole had been a harmless one, and that his tender conscience had already tortured him mightily\u2014for the thing he did.\nPaul\u2019s garish adventures as a prisoner of war in Sudetenland lost their troubling forms as they mired down in the past, but one dismal image would not sink from his consciousness. His wife\u2019s playful banter at dinner one night served to recall what he longed to forget. Sue had spent the afternoon with Mrs. Ward, next door, and Mrs. Ward had shown her an exquisite silver service for twenty-four, which, Sue was astonished to learn, Mr. Ward had liberated and brought home from the war in Europe.\n\u201cHoney,\u201d Sue chided him, \u201ccouldn\u2019t you have brought home just a little something better than you did?\u201d\nIt was not likely that the Germans bewailed Paul\u2019s plundering, for one rusty and badly bent Luftwaffe saber was the whole of his loot. His companions in the Russian Zone, under post-war anarchy, Free Enterprise par excellence that lasted for weeks, came home laden with treasure like Spanish galleons, while Paul was content with his foolish relic. Though he had weeks to seek and take what he would, his first hours as a swashbuckling conqueror were his last. The thing that broke his spirit and his hate, the image that tormented him, began taking shape on a glorious morning of Spring in the mountains, May 8, 1945.\nIt took Paul and his fellow prisoners of war in Hellendorf, Sudetenland, some time to get used to the absence of their guards, who had prudently taken to the forests and hilltops the night before. He and two other Americans wandered uncertainly down the teeming road toward Peterswald, another tranquil farming village of five hundred war-bewildered souls. Humanity moved in wailing rivers, flowing in both directions with a unanimous lament\u2014\u201cThe Russians are coming!\u201d After four tedious kilometers in this milieu, the three settled on the bank of a stream that cut through Peterswald, wondering how they might reach the American lines, wondering if the Russians were killing everyone in their path as some said. Near them, secure in a barn-sheltered hutch, a white rabbit sat in darkness, listening to the uncustomary din without.\nThe trio felt no part of the terror that surged through the village, no pity. \u201cGod knows the arrogant block-heads have been begging for it,\u201d said Paul, and the others nodded in grim amusement. \u201cAfter what the Germans did to them, you can\u2019t blame the Russians, no matter what they do,\u201d said Paul; and again his companions nodded. They sat in silence and watched as frantic mothers hid with their young in cellars, as others scurried up the hillside and into the woods, or deserted their homes to flee down the road with a few precious parcels.\nA wide-eyed, long-striding British lance corporal shouted from the road, \u201cBetter get a move on, lads; they\u2019re in Hellendorf right now!\u201d\nA cloud of dust in the west, the roar of trucks, the scattering of frightened refugees, and the Russians entered the village, pitching cigarettes to the astonished citizens, and giving wet, enthusiastic kisses to all who dared show themselves. Paul cavorted about their trucks, laughing and shouting, and catching the loaves and chunks of meat thrown to him by those liberators who heard his \u201cAmerican! American!\u201d above the wild accordion music that streamed from the red-starred trucks. Happy and excited, he and his friends returned to the brookside with armloads of food, and at once began to stuff themselves.", 0.10822881456443098], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
