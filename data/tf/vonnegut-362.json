brickbat shattered a courtroom window, showering the American flag to the judge\u2019s right with bits of glass.\n33\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT limousine, bound for New York City, crossed the Iroquois River at Ilium once more. In the back seat were Mr. Ewing J. Halyard, the Shah of Bratpuhr, spiritual leader of 6,000,000 members of the Kolhouri sect, and Khashdrahr Miasma, interpreter, and nephew of the Shah. The Shah and Khashdrahr, languishing with nostalgia for the temple bells, the splash of the fountain, and the cries of the houri selano in the palace courtyard, were going home.\nWhen the expedition had crossed this bridge before, at the beginning of their trip, Halyard and the Shah, each in the fashion of his own culture, had been equals in splendor, with Khashdrahr coming off a poor, self-effacing third. Now, the hierarchy of the travelers had shifted. Khashdrahr\u2019s function had been extended, so that he served not only as a language bridge between the Shah and Halyard, but as an intermediate social step between them as well.\nWondering at the mechanics of being a human being, mechanics far beyond the poor leverage of free will, Mr. Halyard found himself representing the fact of no rank as plainly as Doctor Halyard had once represented a great deal of rank. Though he had told his charges nothing of the physical-education examination that could mean life or death to his career, they had sensed the collapse of his status the instant he\u2019d been brought back from the Cornell gymnasium and revived.\nWhen Halyard had recovered, and changed from the ruined shorts and tennis shoes into street clothes, he had seen in the mirror, not a brilliantly fashionable cosmopolite, but an old, overdressed fool. Off had come the boutonniere, the contrasting waistcoat, the colored shirt. Accessory by accessory, garment by garment, he\u2019d stripped away the symbols of the discredited diplomat. Now he was, spiritually and sartorially, whites, grays, and blacks.\nAs though there were anything of Halyard left to crush, one more crushing blow had fallen. The State Department\u2019s personnel machines, automatically, with a respect for law and order never achieved by human beings, had started fraud proceedings against him, since he had never been entitled to his Ph.D., his classification numbers, or, more to the point, to his pay check.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bat for you,\u201d his immediate superior had written, but it was, Halyard knew, an archaic incantation in a wilderness of metal, glass, plastic, and inert gas.", 0.10870704816017315], "title": "Player Piano"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["cornell", 0.027522935779816515], ["will", 0.027522935779816515], ["saints", 0.01834862385321101], ["half", 0.01834862385321101], ["knox", 0.01834862385321101], ["audience", 0.01834862385321101], ["letter", 0.01834862385321101], ["divorced", 0.01834862385321101], ["founded", 0.009174311926605505], ["bring", 0.009174311926605505], ["thursday", 0.009174311926605505], ["crime", 0.009174311926605505], ["innocent", 0.009174311926605505], ["weeks", 0.009174311926605505], ["friendly", 0.009174311926605505], ["hope", 0.009174311926605505], ["colleague", 0.009174311926605505], ["woman", 0.009174311926605505], ["lunatic", 0.009174311926605505], ["couple", 0.009174311926605505], ["kind", 0.009174311926605505], ["choice", 0.009174311926605505], ["awful", 0.009174311926605505], ["brutality", 0.009174311926605505], ["pregnant", 0.009174311926605505], ["university", 0.009174311926605505], ["large", 0.009174311926605505], ["ten", 0.009174311926605505], ["people", 0.009174311926605505], ["alive", 0.009174311926605505], ["burger", 0.009174311926605505], ["rate", 0.009174311926605505], ["college", 0.009174311926605505], ["dear", 0.009174311926605505], ["humor", 0.009174311926605505], ["chicago", 0.009174311926605505], ["witty", 0.009174311926605505], ["darling", 0.009174311926605505], ["shays", 0.009174311926605505], ["told", 0.009174311926605505], ["body", 0.009174311926605505], ["remembered", 0.009174311926605505], ["sagaponack", 0.009174311926605505], ["met", 0.009174311926605505], ["jill", 0.009174311926605505], ["surely", 0.009174311926605505], ["peer", 0.009174311926605505], ["daughter", 0.009174311926605505], ["decently", 0.009174311926605505], ["obsolescent", 0.009174311926605505], ["magazine", 0.009174311926605505], ["lectured", 0.009174311926605505], ["asked", 0.009174311926605505], ["indecent", 0.009174311926605505], ["son", 0.009174311926605505], ["artists", 0.009174311926605505], ["tomorrow", 0.009174311926605505], ["hoping", 0.009174311926605505], ["behaving", 0.009174311926605505], ["city", 0.009174311926605505], ["sake", 0.009174311926605505], ["divorce", 0.009174311926605505], ["adopted", 0.009174311926605505], ["mark", 0.009174311926605505], ["treat", 0.009174311926605505], ["editor", 0.009174311926605505], ["paperwork", 0.009174311926605505], ["easy", 0.009174311926605505], ["jewish", 0.009174311926605505], ["failure", 0.009174311926605505], ["child", 0.009174311926605505], ["baby", 0.009174311926605505], ["1993", 0.009174311926605505], ["society", 0.009174311926605505], ["bother", 0.009174311926605505], ["marriage", 0.009174311926605505], ["meet", 0.009174311926605505], ["worthwhile", 0.009174311926605505], ["process", 0.009174311926605505], ["diverse", 0.009174311926605505], ["goodness", 0.009174311926605505], ["forced", 0.009174311926605505], ["harper", 0.009174311926605505], ["rebellion", 0.009174311926605505], ["ny", 0.009174311926605505], ["writers", 0.009174311926605505], ["lily", 0.009174311926605505], ["nice", 0.009174311926605505], ["ukrainian", 0.009174311926605505], ["max", 0.009174311926605505], ["cheers", 0.009174311926605505], ["wrong", 0.009174311926605505], ["student", 0.009174311926605505], ["effrontery", 0.009174311926605505], ["man", 0.009174311926605505], ["ago", 0.009174311926605505], ["outskirts", 0.009174311926605505], ["1978", 0.009174311926605505], ["kurt", 0.009174311926605505]], "sentiment": ["I am off to the city tomorrow, Thursday, and then to the outskirts of Chicago, to Harper College, where I will tell my audience about the pregnant woman who asked me in a letter if it was wrong to bring an innocent baby into a world as awful as this one.

The brutality of the choice I was forced to make between you and Max is now as little remembered, thank goodness, as Shays\u2019 Rebellion or whatever.\nI lectured at Cornell a couple of weeks ago, and the editor of The Lunatic [a Cornell University humor magazine founded in 1978] had the effrontery to treat me as a colleague and peer. The man\u2019s crime, aside from his being among us, is his failure to go looking for the witty writers and first rate artists who are surely part of a student body as large and diverse as Cornell\u2019s.\nFor the sake of our darling adopted daughter (half Jewish, half Ukrainian, kind of like you, now that I think about it), Lily, now ten, Jill and I are not divorced. I am too old, anyway, for all the paperwork. Divorce has become as obsolescent as marriage. My son Mark is in the process of getting divorced, and I\u2019ve said to him, \u201cWhy bother?\u201d", 0.11022256728778468], "title": "Letters"}}
