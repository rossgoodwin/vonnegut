No matter where I am and how old I become, I still speak of almost nothing but my youth in Indianapolis, Indiana. Whenever anybody out that way began to worry a lot about the poor people when I was young, some eminently respectable Hoosier, possibly an uncle or an aunt, would say that Jesus himself had given up on doing much about the poor. He or she would paraphrase John twelve, Verse eight: The poor people are hopeless. We\u2019ll always be stuck with them.\u2019\n\u201cThe general company was then free to say that the poor were hopeless because they were so lazy or dumb, that they drank too much and had too many children and kept coal in the bathtub, and so on. Somebody was likely to quote Kin Hubbard, the Hoosier humorist, who said that he knew a man who was so poor that he owned twenty-two dogs. And so on.\n\u201cIf those Hoosiers were still alive, which they are not, I would tell them now that Jesus was only joking, and that he was not even thinking much about the poor.\n\u201cI would tell them, too, what I don\u2019t have to tell this particular congregation, that jokes can be noble. Laughs are exactly as honorable as tears. Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion, to the futility of thinking and striving anymore. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning up to do afterward\u2014and since I can start thinking and striving again that much sooner.\n\u201cAll right:\n\u201cIt is the evening before Palm Sunday. Jesus is frustrated and exhausted. He knows that one of his closest associates will soon betray him for money\u2014and that he is going to be mocked and tortured and killed. He is going to feel all that a mortal feels when he dies in convulsions on the cross. His visit among us is almost over\u2014but life must still go on for just a little while.\n\u201cIt is again suppertime.\n\u201cHow many suppertimes does Jesus have left? Five, I believe.\n\u201cHis male companions for this supper are themselves a mockery. One is Judas, who will betray him. The other is Lazarus, who has recently been dead for four days. Lazarus was so dead that he stunk, the Bible says. Lazarus is surely dazed, and not much of a conversationalist\u2014and not necessarily grateful, either, to be alive again. It is a very mixed blessing to be brought back from the dead.\n\u201cIf I had read a little farther, we would have learned that there is a crowd outside, crazy to see Lazarus, not Jesus.
