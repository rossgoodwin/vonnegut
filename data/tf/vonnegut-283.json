years. His older sister, Alice (\u201cAllie\u201d), was a talented artist; his daughters, Edie and Nanny, are professional artists; and his son, Mark, is a talented watercolorist as well as a writer and pediatrician. Kurt had always drawn for fun, doodled and drew cartoonish figures, but he hadn\u2019t used his art in his books until his drawings were used within the text of Slaughterhouse-Five. In 1973 he interspersed the text of Breakfast of Champions with jokey sketches, including a VW, a mechanical beetle, and a tombstone that his fictional character Kilgore Trout planned to tell people he hoped to have. The tombstone said: \u201cSOMEBODY [Sometime to Sometime] He Tried.\u201d He would use such cartoonish sketches again in his novel Hocus Pocus and in his last book, the 2005 collection of essays A Man Without a Country.\nHis first \u201ccoming out\u201d with a show of his artwork was held at the Margo Feiden Galleries in Greenwich Village in 1980. His art would find a new outlet and new nourishment in the next decade, and he would tackle a few different forms of writing, as in his 1980 children\u2019s book, Sun Moon Star, with illustrator Ivan Chermayeff. It was a retelling of the Nativity\u2014the birth of Jesus\u2014for children.\nOn February 25, 1985, he attended, with his wife, Jill, the world premiere of a new musical composition by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It was a Requiem Mass based on the one of 1570 promulgated by Pope Pius V. Vonnegut wrote of that event in Fates Worse Than Death: An Autobiographical Collage that \u201cNobody seemed to know what the Latin words meant \u2026\u201d and nobody seemed to care in the chic, black-tie crowd. But Vonnegut cared. He found in the program an English translation of the Latin words of the Mass and \u201cThey were terrible!\u201d He found them so terrible (nearly the entire Mass was \u201csadistic and masochistic\u201d) that when he got home he \u201cstayed up half the night writing a better one,\u201d explaining that was not a vain statement, since \u201cAnyone could write a better one and nobody could write a worse one.\u201d\nHe found a specialist in Church Latin at New York University and commissioned him to translate his English version of the Mass back into Latin, then ran into a composer while serving on jury duty and got him to set it to music. It had its world premiere in 1988 with \u201cthe best Unitarian Universalist choir in the country\u201d at their church in Buffalo, New York. Published in the appendix of Fates are both the English translation of the Requiem Mass of 1570 and Vonnegut\u2019s version of 1985.\nThese diversions did not detract from Vonnegut\u2019s primary work. During this decade, as he turned sixty, he was as productive as ever, publishing his essay collection Palm Sunday (1981) and the novels Deadeye Dick (1982), Gal\u00e1pagos (1985), Bluebeard (1987), and Hocus Pocus (1990), tackling themes in his fiction from natural selection to modern art. He wrote movingly of his father turning from architecture to pottery after the Great Depression and WWII brought most building to a halt and his commissions dried up. The article, called \u201cSleeping Beauty,\u201d was published in Architectural Digest (June 1984) and was later incorporated into Fates Worse Than Death. It may have been inspired by a trip he took to Tokyo that spring to speak at an international conference of PEN; while there, he arranged for the Association of Japanese Graphic Artists to take him on a tour of potteries in the countryside, \u201cin honor of my father,\u201d he told a friend.\nThroughout this decade of high productivity as a writer, Vonnegut was incredibly active as a public speaker, was a spokesman for the rights of writers as an officer of PEN, and made it his personal mission to bring his beloved Russian translator, Rita Rait, to America, battling bureaucracies all the way and at last succeeding.\nThe eighties were an active and tumultuous time in his personal life also. He and his wife, Jill, adopted their daughter, Lily (Jill\u2019s first and Kurt\u2019s fourth child), at the end of 1982. As well as this delightful addition to his life (he adored the child), there were personal and professional pressures and upsets. Though his audience was faithful and growing\u2014all his novels of the decade became bestsellers\u2014critics were still pummeling him.\nOn February 13, 1984, the thirty-ninth anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden, Kurt was hospitalized after an overdose of sleeping pills and alcohol. This writer who described himself as a \u201cmonopolar depressive descended from monopolar depressives\u201d (Timequake) was sent to what he called in a letter to his friend Walter Miller \u201cthe short-termer nut-ward at Saint Vincent\u2019s [Hospital].\u201d His son, Mark, described it (in the introduction to Armageddon in Retrospect) as a \u201cbizarre, surreal incident when he took too many pills and ended up in a psych hospital, but it never felt like he was in any danger. Within a day he was bouncing around the dayroom playing Ping-Pong and making friends. It seemed like he was doing a not very convincing imitation of someone with mental illness.\u201d\nThere were many personal losses for Kurt during the eighties. His writer friends who were \u201csummer neighbors\u201d on Long Island had died by the end of the decade, including James Jones, Nelson Algren, Truman Capote, and Irwin Shaw. Vonnegut was moved as well by the death of a writer friend from the 1950s, the popular and highly regarded mystery novelist John D. MacDonald. MacDonald was one of the group Kurt called \u201cthe Professionals,\u201d who started out as he did in the Golden Age of Magazines and who were also nurtured by his own early editor Knox Burger and agent Max Wilkinson.", 0.12266916182409136], "title": "Letters"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["good", 0.026845637583892617], ["cook", 0.020134228187919462], ["stars", 0.020134228187919462], ["hazel", 0.020134228187919462], ["pointed", 0.013422818791946308], ["red", 0.013422818791946308], ["dead", 0.013422818791946308], ["blue", 0.013422818791946308], ["months", 0.013422818791946308], ["american", 0.013422818791946308], ["family", 0.013422818791946308], ["fire", 0.013422818791946308], ["survived", 0.013422818791946308], ["robinson", 0.013422818791946308], ["swiss", 0.013422818791946308], ["taxi", 0.006711409395973154], ["cooking", 0.006711409395973154], ["marveled", 0.006711409395973154], ["fifty", 0.006711409395973154], ["melt", 0.006711409395973154], ["adjustment", 0.006711409395973154], ["birds", 0.006711409395973154], ["death", 0.006711409395973154], ["unkind", 0.006711409395973154], ["betsy", 0.006711409395973154], ["wood", 0.006711409395973154], ["lorenzo", 0.006711409395973154], ["preserved", 0.006711409395973154], ["easy", 0.006711409395973154], ["germs", 0.006711409395973154], ["ross", 0.006711409395973154], ["sitting", 0.006711409395973154], ["food", 0.006711409395973154], ["123", 0.006711409395973154], ["discuss", 0.006711409395973154], ["ruins", 0.006711409395973154], ["wrote", 0.006711409395973154], ["satisfactory", 0.006711409395973154], ["people", 0.006711409395973154], ["house", 0.006711409395973154], ["mosquitoes", 0.006711409395973154], ["society", 0.006711409395973154], ["curious", 0.006711409395973154], ["living", 0.006711409395973154], ["stood", 0.006711409395973154], ["clearing", 0.006711409395973154], ["stool", 0.006711409395973154], ["ice", 0.006711409395973154], ["health", 0.006711409395973154], ["disney", 0.006711409395973154], ["inappropriately", 0.006711409395973154], ["sewing", 0.006711409395973154], ["frank", 0.006711409395973154], ["men", 0.006711409395973154], ["water", 0.006711409395973154], ["cut", 0.006711409395973154], ["stew", 0.006711409395973154], ["newt", 0.006711409395973154], ["wait", 0.006711409395973154], ["dry", 0.006711409395973154], ["goods", 0.006711409395973154], ["mona", 0.006711409395973154], ["david", 0.006711409395973154], ["thing", 0.006711409395973154], ["husband", 0.006711409395973154], ["nearby", 0.006711409395973154], ["point", 0.006711409395973154], ["pot", 0.006711409395973154], ["grubbing", 0.006711409395973154], ["legged", 0.006711409395973154], ["walt", 0.006711409395973154], ["gaiety", 0.006711409395973154], ["tons", 0.006711409395973154], ["weather", 0.006711409395973154], ["pretty", 0.006711409395973154], ["spoke", 0.006711409395973154], ["three", 0.006711409395973154], ["bolivar", 0.006711409395973154], ["live", 0.006711409395973154], ["call", 0.006711409395973154], ["monotonously", 0.006711409395973154], ["white", 0.006711409395973154], ["thaw", 0.006711409395973154], ["storm", 0.006711409395973154], ["gay", 0.006711409395973154], ["deer", 0.006711409395973154], ["accurately", 0.006711409395973154], ["clue", 0.006711409395973154], ["cloth", 0.006711409395973154], ["flag", 0.006711409395973154], ["simmered", 0.006711409395973154], ["mice", 0.006711409395973154], ["true", 0.006711409395973154], ["eat", 0.006711409395973154], ["plants", 0.006711409395973154], ["loved", 0.006711409395973154], ["animals", 0.006711409395973154], ["iron", 0.006711409395973154], ["making", 0.006711409395973154], ["problem", 0.006711409395973154], ["called", 0.006711409395973154], ["san", 0.006711409395973154], ["rode", 0.006711409395973154], ["cows", 0.006711409395973154], ["ready", 0.006711409395973154], ["clothing", 0.006711409395973154], ["protested", 0.006711409395973154], ["peach", 0.006711409395973154], ["things", 0.006711409395973154], ["isolated", 0.006711409395973154], ["hot", 0.006711409395973154], ["book", 0.006711409395973154], ["build", 0.006711409395973154], ["crosbys", 0.006711409395973154], ["strips", 0.006711409395973154], ["kinds", 0.006711409395973154], ["shelter", 0.006711409395973154], ["uniformly", 0.006711409395973154], ["kelly", 0.006711409395973154], ["pigs", 0.006711409395973154], ["charm", 0.006711409395973154], ["complacent", 0.006711409395973154], ["canned", 0.006711409395973154], ["windrows", 0.006711409395973154], ["napping", 0.006711409395973154], ["camp", 0.006711409395973154], ["green", 0.006711409395973154], ["berries", 0.006711409395973154], ["left", 0.006711409395973154]], "sentiment": ["I particularly didn\u2019t want to discuss the death of Mona since, as we rode along in the taxi, the Crosbys and little Newt seemed so inappropriately gay.\nHazel gave me a clue to the gaiety. \u201cWait until you see how we live. We\u2019ve got all kinds of good things to eat. Whenever we want water, we just build a camp-fire and melt some. The Swiss Family Robinson\u2014that\u2019s what we call ourselves.\u201d\n123\nOF MICE AND MEN\nA CURIOUS SIX MONTHS followed\u2014the six months in which I wrote this book. Hazel spoke accurately when she called our little society the Swiss Family Robinson, for we had survived a storm, were isolated, and then the living became very easy indeed. It was not without a certain Walt Disney charm.\nNo plants or animals survived, it\u2019s true. But ice-nine preserved pigs and cows and little deer and windrows of birds and berries until we were ready to thaw and cook them. Moreover, there were tons of canned goods to be had for the grubbing in the ruins of Bolivar. And we seemed to be the only people left on San Lorenzo.\nFood was no problem, and neither were clothing or shelter, for the weather was uniformly dry and dead and hot. Our health was monotonously good. Apparently all the germs were dead, too\u2014or napping.\nOur adjustment became so satisfactory, so complacent, that no one marveled or protested when Hazel said, \u201cOne good thing anyway, no mosquitoes.\u201d\nShe was sitting on a three-legged stool in the clearing where Frank\u2019s house had stood.

bottom. And he\u2019d forget meals, and go out into the cold or wet without enough clothes on, and he would never notice sickness until it almost killed him. He was what we used to call absent-minded. Looking back now, of course, we say he was starting to be amphibious.\nKonigswasser was a mathematician, and he did all his living with his mind. The body he had to haul around with that wonderful mind was about as much use to him as a flatcar of scrap-iron. Whenever he got sick and had to pay some attention to his body, he\u2019d rant somewhat like this:\n\"The mind is the only thing about human beings that\u2019s worth anything. Why does it have to be tied to a bag of skin, blood, hair, meat, bones, and tubes? No wonder people can\u2019t get anything done, stuck for life with a parasite that has to be stuffed with food and protected from weather and germs all the time. And the fool thing wears out anyway\u2014no matter how much you stuff and protect it!\n\"Who,\" he wanted to know, \"really wants one of the things? What\u2019s so wonderful about protoplasm that we\u2019ve got to carry so damned many pounds of it with us wherever we go?\n\"Trouble with the world,\" said Konigswasser, \"isn\u2019t too many people\u2014it\u2019s too many bodies.\"\nWhen his teeth went bad on him, and he had to have them all out, and he couldn\u2019t get a set of dentures that were at all comfortable, he wrote in his diary, \"If living matter was able to evolve enough to get out of the ocean, which was really quite a pleasant place to live, it certainly ought to be able to take another step and get out of bodies, which are pure nuisances when you stop to think about them.\"\nHe wasn\u2019t a prude about bodies, understand, and he wasn\u2019t jealous of people who had better ones than he did. He just thought bodies were a lot more trouble than they were worth.\nHe didn\u2019t have great hopes that people would really evolve out of their bodies in his time. He just wished they would. Thinking hard about it, he walked through a park in his shirtsleeves and stopped off at the zoo to watch the lions being fed. Then, when the rainstorm turned to sleet, he headed back home and was interested to see firemen on the edge of a lagoon, where they were using a pulmotor on a drowned man.\nWitnesses said the old man had walked right into the water and had kept going without changing his expression until he\u2019d disappeared. Konigswasser got a look at the victim\u2019s face and said he\u2019d never seen a better reason for suicide.
