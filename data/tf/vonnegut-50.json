The place is loaded with romantics who\u2019ve fled the big cities, and they\u2019re all wise in interesting and special ways. Me too.\nI haven\u2019t been in New York for damn near a year. No sense in a man with writer\u2019s block going to New York. I\u2019ve been bathing in hot water and Epsom salts, and finally sold two stories in two weeks to the Saturday Evening Post, so maybe I\u2019ll show my face down there again after the holidays. Any chance of your being there? New York, I mean. The Post is in New York, isn\u2019t it? If it isn\u2019t New York, it\u2019s Dayton, and I\u2019m damned if I\u2019ll go to Dayton. Jane and I did a dizzy thing a couple of days ago, and it turned out to be the best lark in years. We went to Harvard for two days. We just walked in and sat down in different classrooms, and nobody came around collecting tickets. Heard Sirokin on Spengler, A. Schlesinger, Sr. on the Hudson River school of painting, A. Schlesinger, Jr. on Hawthorne and Melville, Handlin on colonial America\u2019s attitude toward European intellectual movements, McClusky on the Supreme Court Decisions relative to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and so on. More fun than a barrel of monkeys, till reeled the mind. Best thunderclap came from Spengler, to the effect that science is either true or false, art is either shallow or deep. Second best came from some Supreme Court Justice, Jackson, I think, to the effect that one man\u2019s right to swing his fists stops where another man\u2019s nose begins.\nYou\u2019ll write someday, Miller. It\u2019s in the cards. Be of good heart.\nKurt\nFebruary 7, 1954\nOsterville, MA\nTO HARRY BRAGUE\nThe book Kurt reports to his editor that he is working on that is \u201cgoing to be a good book\u201d is Cat\u2019s

By the time Zoltan was a sophomore, Trout was a bum.\nThe plagiarized story was about a planet in another galaxy, where the little green people, each with only one eye in the middle of his or her forehead, could get food only if they could sell goods or services to somebody else. The planet ran out of customers, and nobody could think of anything sensible to do about that. All the little green people starved to death.\nMrs. Wilkerson suspected plagiarism. Zoltan confessed, thinking it was a funny rather than a serious thing he\u2019d done. To him, plagiarism was what Trout would have called a mopery, \u201cindecent exposure in the presence of a blind person of the same sex.\u201d\nMrs. Wilkerson decided to teach Zoltan a lesson. She had him write, \u201cI STOLE PROPERTY FROM KILGORE TROUT,\u201d on the blackboard while the class watched. Then, for the next week, she made him wear a shirt cardboard with the letter P on it, hung on his chest from around his neck, whenever he was in her classroom. She could get the piss sued out of her for doing that to a student nowadays. But then was then, and now is now.\nThe inspiration for what Mrs. Wilkerson did to young Zoltan Pepper was of course The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. In that one, a woman has to wear a big A for adultery on her bosom because she let a man not her husband ejaculate in her birth canal. She won\u2019t tell what his name is. He\u2019s a preacher!\nSince Dudley Prince said it was a bag lady who had put the story in the trash receptacle out front, Zoltan didn\u2019t consider the possibility that it had been Trout himself. \u201cIt could have been his daughter or granddaughter,\u201d he speculated. \u201cTrout himself must have died years ago. I certainly hope so, and may his soul rot in Hell.\u201d\nBut Trout was right next door! He was feeling just great! He was so relieved at having gotten rid of \u201cThe Sisters B-36\u201d that he had started another story. He had been completing a story every ten days, on average, since he was fourteen. That was thirty-six a year, say. This one could have been his twenty-five-hundredth! It wasn\u2019t set on another planet. It was set in the office of a psychiatrist in St. Paul, Minnesota.\nThe name of the shrink was the name of the story, too, which was \u201cDr. Schadenfreude.\u201d This doctor had his patients lie on a couch and talk, all right, but they could ramble on only about dumb or crazy things that had happened to total strangers in supermarket tabloids or on TV talk shows.", 0.03602591036414565], "title":

McLuhan was confident that she would sooner or later get a chance to break every bone in Billy\u2019s little body, maybe even shoot him with his own gun. She wouldn\u2019t have minded doing those things. She thought he was more disgusting than a blood-filled tick.\nIt wasn\u2019t compassion that changed her mind. It was the discovery that Billy had a gang. There were at least eight people around the manhole, men and women in equal numbers, with stockings pulled over their heads. It was the women who laid firm hands on Nancy, told her to keep calm. They were all at least as tall as Nancy and they held her in places where they could hurt her like hell if they had to.\nNancy closed her eyes, but this didn\u2019t protect her from the obvious conclusion: These perverted women were sisters from the Ethical Suicide Service. This upset her so much that she asked loudly and bitterly, \"How can you violate your oaths like this?\"\nShe was promptly hurt so badly that she doubled up and burst into tears.\nWhen she straightened up again, there was plenty more she wanted to say, but she kept her mouth shut. She speculated silently as to what on Earth could make Suicide Hostesses turn against every concept of human decency. Nothingheadedness alone couldn\u2019t begin to explain it. They had to be drugged besides.\nNancy went over in her mind all the terrible drugs she\u2019d learned about in school, persuaded herself that the women had taken the worst one of all. That drug was so powerful, Nancy\u2019s teachers had told her, that even a person numb from the waist down would copulate repeatedly and enthusiastically after just one glass. That had to be the answer: The women, and probably the men, too, had been drinking gin.\nThey hastened Nancy into the middle frame house, which was dark like all the rest, and Nancy heard the men giving Billy the news. It was in this news that Nancy perceived a glint of hope. Help might be on its way.\nThe gang member who had phoned Nancy obscenely had fooled the police into believing that they had captured Billy the Poet, which was bad for Nancy. The police didn\u2019t know yet that Nancy was missing, two men told Billy, and a telegram had been sent to Mary Kraft in Nancy\u2019s name, declaring that Nancy had been called to New York City on urgent family business.\nThat was where Nancy saw the glint of hope: Mary wouldn\u2019t believe that telegram. Mary knew Nancy had no family in New York.

moonlight. He felt spooky and luminous, felt as though he were wrapped in cool fur that was full of static electricity. He looked down at his bare feet. They were ivory and blue.\nBilly now shuffled down his upstairs hallway, knowing he was about to be kidnapped by a flying saucer. The hallway was zebra-striped with darkness and moonlight. The moonlight came into the hallway through doorways of the empty rooms of Billy\u2019s two children, children no more. They were gone forever. Billy was guided by dread and the lack of dread. Dread told him when to stop. Lack of it told him when to move again. He stopped.\nHe went into his daughter\u2019s room. Her drawers were dumped. Her closet was empty. Heaped in the middle of her room were all the possessions she could not take on a honeymoon. She had a Princess telephone extension all her own\u2014on her windowsill. Its tiny night light stared at Billy. And then it rang.\nBilly answered. There was a drunk on the other end. Billy could almost smell his breath\u2014mustard gas and roses. It was a wrong number. Billy hung up. There was a soft drink bottle on the windowsill. Its label boasted that it contained no nourishment whatsoever.\nBilly Pilgrim padded downstairs on his blue and ivory feet. He went into the kitchen, where the moonlight called his attention to a half bottle of champagne on the kitchen table, all that was left from the reception in the tent. Somebody had stoppered it again. \u201cDrink me,\u201d it seemed to say.\nSo Billy uncorked it with his thumbs. It didn\u2019t make a pop. The champagne was dead. So it goes.\nBilly looked at the clock on the gas stove. He had an hour to kill before the saucer came. He went into the living room, swinging the bottle like a dinner bell, turned on the television. He came slightly unstuck in time, saw the late movie backwards, then forwards again. It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:\nAmerican planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.\nThe formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.\nWhen the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.", -0.021271222866967546], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["forward", 0.042105263157894736], ["roller", 0.031578947368421054], ["beatrice", 0.021052631578947368], ["rumfoord", 0.021052631578947368], ["coasters", 0.021052631578947368], ["going", 0.021052631578947368], ["kazak", 0.021052631578947368], ["faster", 0.021052631578947368], ["god", 0.021052631578947368], ["bea", 0.021052631578947368], ["will", 0.021052631578947368], ["turn", 0.021052631578947368], ["husband", 0.021052631578947368], ["misfortunes", 0.010526315789473684], ["stalked", 0.010526315789473684], ["humble", 0.010526315789473684], ["constant", 0.010526315789473684], ["presence", 0.010526315789473684], ["skip", 0.010526315789473684], ["turned", 0.010526315789473684], ["idea", 0.010526315789473684], ["paltry", 0.010526315789473684], ["love", 0.010526315789473684], ["flews", 0.010526315789473684], ["indifferent", 0.010526315789473684], ["hate", 0.010526315789473684], ["outward", 0.010526315789473684], ["behaving", 0.010526315789473684], ["traction", 0.010526315789473684], ["proofs", 0.010526315789473684], ["angle", 0.010526315789473684], ["groaned", 0.010526315789473684], ["tenderness", 0.010526315789473684], ["ends", 0.010526315789473684], ["things", 0.010526315789473684], ["museum", 0.010526315789473684], ["pairing", 0.010526315789473684], ["landed", 0.010526315789473684], ["better", 0.010526315789473684], ["glittered", 0.010526315789473684], ["treat", 0.010526315789473684], ["insubstantial", 0.010526315789473684], ["intelligence", 0.010526315789473684], ["crude", 0.010526315789473684], ["translucent", 0.010526315789473684], ["aristocracy", 0.010526315789473684], ["disgustingly", 0.010526315789473684], ["arrival", 0.010526315789473684], ["eyes", 0.010526315789473684], ["felt", 0.010526315789473684], ["titan", 0.010526315789473684], ["electric", 0.010526315789473684], ["proudly", 0.010526315789473684], ["await", 0.010526315789473684], ["revealed", 0.010526315789473684], ["talk", 0.010526315789473684], ["moment", 0.010526315789473684], ["flung", 0.010526315789473684], ["ruthlessly", 0.010526315789473684], ["tinnily", 0.010526315789473684], ["direction", 0.010526315789473684], ["skidding", 0.010526315789473684], ["nodded", 0.010526315789473684], ["day", 0.010526315789473684], ["abruptly", 0.010526315789473684], ["dignity", 0.010526315789473684], ["house", 0.010526315789473684], ["coaster", 0.010526315789473684], ["materials", 0.010526315789473684], ["place", 0.010526315789473684], ["exquisite", 0.010526315789473684], ["polished", 0.010526315789473684], ["time", 0.010526315789473684], ["aristocratically", 0.010526315789473684], ["making", 0.010526315789473684], ["foyer", 0.010526315789473684], ["floor", 0.010526315789473684], ["admission", 0.010526315789473684], ["flapping", 0.010526315789473684]], "sentiment": ["\"We turned around and came home,\" said Beatrice proudly.

If it seems crude of me not to hate the idea of your pairing off with Constant, it\u2019s only an humble admission on my part that he\u2019s going to make you a far better husband than I ever was or will be.\n\"Look forward to being really in love for the first time, Bea,\" said Rumfoord. \"Look forward to behaving aristocratically without any outward proofs of your aristocracy. Look forward to having nothing but the dignity and intelligence and tenderness that God gave you\u2014look forward to taking those materials and nothing else, and making something exquisite with them.\"\nRumfoord groaned tinnily. He was becoming insubstantial. \"Oh, God\u2014\" he said, \"you talk about roller coasters\u2014\n\"Stop and think sometime about the roller coaster I\u2019m on.

In a matter of seconds, a typical brain of a million years ago had turned the best citizen in Guayaquil into a ravening terrorist.\n17\nON THE ISLAND OF MANHATTAN, a middle-aged American publicity man contemplated the collapse of his masterpiece, which was \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d He had just moved into new offices within the hollow crown of the Chrysler Building, formerly the showroom of a harp company which found itself bankrupt\u2014like the City of Ilium and Ecuador and the Philippines and Turkey, and on and on. His name was Bobby King.\nHe was in the same time zone as Guayaquil, and a line drawn due south from the deep crease in his brow to just below the equator would have found a terminal in an even deeper crease in the brow of *Andrew MacIntosh in Guayaquil. *MacIntosh was trying to shout life into a dead telephone. *MacIntosh might as well have been holding a stuffed Gal\u00e1pagos marine iguana alongside his boxy head as he cried out ever more imperiously: \u201cHello! Hello!\u201d\nBobby King had a stuffed Gal\u00e1pagos marine iguana on his desk; had in fact amused more than one visitor by pretending that he had mistaken it for his telephone, holding it alongside his head and saying, \u201cHello! Hello!\u201d\nHe was in no joking mood now, though, surely. In his own way, he had done as much as Charles Darwin to make the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands famous\u2014with a ten-month campaign of publicity and advertising which had persuaded millions of people all over the planet that the maiden voyage of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin would indeed be \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d In the process, he had made celebrities of many of the islands\u2019 creatures, the flightless cormorants, the blue-footed boobies, the larcenous frigate birds, and on and on.\nHis clients were the Ministry of Travel of Ecuador, Ecuatoriana Airlines, and the owners of the Hotel El Dorado and the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, the paternal uncles of *Siegfried and Captain Adolf von Kleist. Neither the hotel manager nor the Captain had to work for livings, incidentally. They were fabulously well to do through inheritance, but felt that they should keep busy all the same.\nIt now appeared certain to King, although he had not been told so yet, that his work had been for nothing, that \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d would not take place.\nAs for the stuffed marine iguana on his desk: He had made that reptile the totemic animal for the cruise\u2014had caused its image to be painted on either side of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin\u2019s bow, and to appear as a logo in every ad and at the top of every publicity release.\nIn real life, the creature could be more than a meter long, and look as fearsome as a Chinese dragon.

Technically, if not spiritually, they were pretty darn good for a kid my age\u2014a kid whose self-imposed lessons had consisted of copying, stroke by stroke, illustrations by Dan Gregory.\nI was obviously born to draw better than most people, just as the widow Berman and Paul Slazinger were obviously born to tell stories better than most people can. Other people are obviously born to sing and dance or explain the stars in the sky or do magic tricks or be great leaders or athletes, and so on.\nI think that could go back to the time when people had to live in small groups of relatives\u2014maybe fifty or a hundred people at the most. And evolution or God or whatever arranged things genetically, to keep the little families going, to cheer them up, so that they could all have somebody to tell stories around the campfire at night, and somebody else to paint pictures on the walls of the caves, and somebody else who wasn\u2019t afraid of anything and so on.\nThat\u2019s what I think. And of course a scheme like that doesn\u2019t make sense anymore, because simply moderate giftedness has been made worthless by the printing press and radio and television and satellites and all that. A moderately gifted person who would have been a community treasure a thousand years ago has to give up, has to go into some other line of work, since modern communications put him or her into daily competition with nothing but world\u2019s champions.\nThe entire planet can get along nicely now with maybe a dozen champion performers in each area of human giftedness. A moderately gifted person has to keep his or her gifts all bottled up until, in a manner of speaking, he or she gets drunk at a wedding and tap-dances on the coffee table like Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers.

Remember that two great masters of our language, William Shakespeare and James Joyce, wrote sentences which were almost childlike when their subjects were most profound. \u201cTo be or not to be?\u201d asks Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet. The longest word is three letters long. Joyce, when he was frisky, could put together a sentence as intricate and glittering as a necklace for Cleopatra, but my favorite sentence in his short story \u201cEveline\u201d is this one: \u201cShe was tired.\u201d At that point in the story, no other words could break the heart of a reader as those words do.\nSimplicity of language is not only reputable, but perhaps even sacred. The Bible opens with a sentence well within the writing skills of a lively fourteen-year-old: \u201cIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\u201d\nIt may be that you, too, are capable of making necklaces for Cleopatra, so to speak. But your eloquence should be the servant of the ideas in your head. Your rule might be this: If a sentence, no matter how excellent, does not illuminate my subject in some new and useful way, scratch it out. Here is the same rule paraphrased to apply to storytelling, to fiction: Never include a sentence which does not either remark on character or advance the action.\nThe writing style which is most natural for you is bound to echo speech you heard when a child. English was the novelist Joseph Conrad\u2019s third language, and much that seems piquant in his use of English was no doubt colored by his first language, which was Polish. And lucky indeed is the writer who has grown up in Ireland, for the English spoken there is so amusing and musical. I myself grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana, where common speech sounds like a band saw cutting galvanized tin, and employs a vocabulary as un-ornamental as a monkey wrench.\nIn some of the more remote hollows of Appalachia, children still grow up hearing songs and locutions of Elizabethan times. Yes, and many Americans grow up hearing a language other than English, or an English dialect a majority of Americans cannot understand.\nAll these varieties of speech are beautiful, just as the varieties of butterflies are beautiful. No matter what your first language, you should treasure it all your life. If it happens not to be standard English, and if it shows itself when you write standard English, the result is usually delightful, like a very pretty girl with one eye that is green and one that is blue.\nI myself find that I trust my own writing most, and others seem to trust it most, too, when I sound most like a person from Indianapolis, which is what I am. What alternatives do I have? The one most vehemently recommended by teachers has no doubt been pressed on you, as well: that I write like cultivated Englishmen of a century or more ago.\nI used to be exasperated by such teachers, but am no more. I understand now that all those antique essays and stories with which I was to compare my own work were not magnificent for their datedness or foreignness, but for saying precisely what their authors meant them to say. My teachers wished me to write accurately, always selecting the most effective words, and relating the words to one another unambiguously, rigidly, like parts of a machine. The teachers did not want to turn me into an Englishman after all. They hoped that I would become understandable\u2014and therefore understood.\nAnd there went my dream of doing with words what Pablo Picasso did with paint or what any number of jazz idols did with music. If I broke all the rules of punctuation, had words mean whatever I wanted them to mean, and strung them together higgledy-piggledy, I would simply not be understood. So you, too, had better avoid Picasso-style or jazz-style writing, if you have something worth saying and wish to be understood.", 0.21191510695187166], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["robert", 0.14285714285714285], ["nancy", 0.06349206349206349], ["tone", 0.031746031746031744], ["turned", 0.031746031746031744], ["tears", 0.031746031746031744], ["sound", 0.031746031746031744], ["bets", 0.015873015873015872], ["argumentative", 0.015873015873015872], ["hands", 0.015873015873015872], ["head", 0.015873015873015872], ["slap", 0.015873015873015872], ["unaccompanied", 0.015873015873015872], ["worldly", 0.015873015873015872], ["sounds", 0.015873015873015872], ["eyes", 0.015873015873015872], ["worked", 0.015873015873015872], ["harsh", 0.015873015873015872], ["unsuitable", 0.015873015873015872], ["things", 0.015873015873015872], ["day", 0.015873015873015872], ["startled", 0.015873015873015872], ["unromantic", 0.015873015873015872], ["wildly", 0.015873015873015872], ["dismayed", 0.015873015873015872], ["red", 0.015873015873015872], ["nice", 0.015873015873015872], ["poor", 0.015873015873015872], ["life", 0.015873015873015872], ["rims", 0.015873015873015872], ["involuntary", 0.015873015873015872], ["twinkling", 0.015873015873015872], ["mad", 0.015873015873015872], ["wedding", 0.015873015873015872], ["harshly", 0.015873015873015872], ["hold", 0.015873015873015872], ["response", 0.015873015873015872], ["cumbersomely", 0.015873015873015872], ["instant", 0.015873015873015872], ["plain", 0.015873015873015872], ["shock", 0.015873015873015872], ["bitterness", 0.015873015873015872], ["air", 0.015873015873015872], ["lousy", 0.015873015873015872], ["loudly", 0.015873015873015872], ["mildly", 0.015873015873015872], ["guy", 0.015873015873015872], ["view", 0.015873015873015872], ["shook", 0.015873015873015872]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThat sounds like a nice way to be.\u201d Her own tone, in involuntary response to Robert\u2019s, was mildly argumentative.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lousy way to be,\u201d said Robert harshly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why,\u201d said Nancy.\n\u201cThe poor guy bets his life again and again and again on things that are just\u2014\u201d he shook his head wildly, \u201cjust nothing at all!

He didn\u2019t know.\nZuzu, it would turn out, had been killed by a person or persons unknown, possibly raped, possibly not. We will never know. It was not an ideal time for Forensic Medicine. Tex, meanwhile, was ascending the tower of the library here with a rifle and ammunition. He was going clear to the top, to turn the belfry itself into a sniper\u2019s nest.\nALTON DARWIN WAS never worried, no matter how bad things got. He laughed when he heard that paratroops, advancing on foot, had surrounded the prison across the lake and, on our side, were digging in to the west and south of Scipio. State Police and vigilantes had already set up a roadblock at the head of the lake. Alton Darwin laughed as though he had achieved a great victory.\nI knew people like that in Vietnam. Jack Patton had that sort of courage. I could be as brave as Jack over there. In fact, I am pretty sure that I was shot at more and killed more people. But I was worried sick most of the time. Jack never worried. He told me so.\nI asked him how he could be that way. He said, \u201cI think I must have a screw loose. I can\u2019t care about what might happen next to me or anyone.\u201d\nAlton Darwin had the same untightened screw. He was a convicted mass murderer, but never showed any remorse that I could see.\nDURING MY LAST year in Vietnam, I, too, reacted at press briefings as though our defeats were victories. But I was under orders to do that. That wasn\u2019t my natural disposition.\nALTON DARWIN, AND this was true of Jack Patton, too, spoke of trivial and serious matters in the same tone of voice, with the same gestures and facial expressions. Nothing mattered more or less than anything else.\nAlton Darwin, I remember, was talking to me with seemingly deep concern about how many of the convicts who had crossed the ice with him to Scipio were deserting, were going back across the ice to the prison, or turning themselves in at the roadblock at the head of the lake in hopes of amnesty. The deserters were worriers. They didn\u2019t want to die, and they didn\u2019t want to be held responsible, even though many of them were responsible, for the murders and rapes in Scipio.", 0.17824206526334185], "title": "Hocus

A name from the past, Maude. I couldn\u2019t believe it at first. Charley was a fraternity brother and just about the biggest man in the whole class of 1910. Track star, president of the fraternity, editor of the paper, Phi Beta Kappa.\u201d\n\u201cGoodness! What\u2019s he doing coming here to see poor little us?\u201d said Maude.\nEarl was witnessing a troubling tableau that had been in the back of his mind for years: Charley Freeman, urbane, tastefully clothed, was having a plate set before him by Earl, who wore a waiter\u2019s jacket. When he\u2019d invited Charley to come on out, Earl\u2019s enthusiasm had been automatic, the reflex of a man who prided himself on being a plain, ordinary, friendly fellow, for all of his success. Now, remembering their college relationship, Earl found that the prospect of Charley\u2019s arrival was making him uncomfortable. \u201cHe was a rich kid,\u201d Earl said. \u201cOne of those guys\u201d\u2014and his voice was tinged with bitterness\u2014\u201dwho had everything. You know?\u201d\n\u201cWell, hon,\u201d said Maude, \u201cyou weren\u2019t exactly behind the door when they passed out the looks and brains.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014but when they passed out the money, they handed me a waiter\u2019s jacket and a mop.\u201d She looked at him sympathetically, and he was encouraged to pour out his heart on the subject. \u201cBy golly, Maude, it does something to a man to go around having to wait on guys his same age, cleaning up after \u2019em, and seeing them with nice clothes and all the money in the world, going off to some resort in the summer when I had to go to work to pay next year\u2019s tuition.\u201d Earl was surprised at the emotion in his voice. \u201cAnd all the time they\u2019re looking down on you, like there was something wrong with people who weren\u2019t handed their money on a silver platter.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that makes me good and mad!\u201d Maude said, squaring her shoulders indignantly, as though to protect Earl from those who\u2019d humiliated him in college. \u201cIf this great Charley Freeman snooted you in the old days, I don\u2019t see why we should have him in the house now.\u201d\n\u201cOh, heck\u2014forgive and forget,\u201d Earl said gloomily. \u201cDoesn\u2019t throw me anymore. He seemed to want to come out, and I try to be a good fellow, no matter what.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the high-and-mighty Freeman doing now?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. Something big, I guess. He went to med school, and I came back here, and we kind of lost touch.\u201d Experimentally, Earl pressed a button on the wall. From the basement came muffled whirs and clicks, as machines took control of the temperature and humidity and purity of the atmosphere about him. \u201cBut I don\u2019t expect Charley\u2019s doing a bit better than this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat were some of the things he did to you?\u201d Maude pursued, still indignant.", 0.09399972632731253], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["trout", 0.058333333333333334], ["manager", 0.05], ["planet", 0.03333333333333333], ["material", 0.016666666666666666], ["miraculous", 0.016666666666666666], ["told", 0.016666666666666666], ["tinhorn", 0.016666666666666666], ["moon", 0.016666666666666666], ["times", 0.016666666666666666], ["sticking", 0.016666666666666666], ["hoped", 0.016666666666666666], ["dying", 0.016666666666666666], ["insulating", 0.016666666666666666], ["man", 0.016666666666666666], ["theater", 0.016666666666666666], ["rocket", 0.008333333333333333], ["cheap", 0.008333333333333333], ["earth", 0.008333333333333333], ["children", 0.008333333333333333], ["concerned", 0.008333333333333333], ["ships", 0.008333333333333333], ["late", 0.008333333333333333], ["foot", 0.008333333333333333], ["aluminum", 0.008333333333333333], ["fully", 0.008333333333333333], ["sauntered", 0.008333333333333333], ["sneezed", 0.008333333333333333], ["bless", 0.008333333333333333], ["subway", 0.008333333333333333], ["night", 0.008333333333333333], ["small", 0.008333333333333333], ["friendship", 0.008333333333333333], ["ears", 0.008333333333333333], ["square", 0.008333333333333333], ["creator", 0.008333333333333333], ["house", 0.008333333333333333], ["hard", 0.008333333333333333], ["corner", 0.008333333333333333], ["unstuck", 0.008333333333333333], ["encouraged", 0.008333333333333333], ["blue", 0.008333333333333333], ["god", 0.008333333333333333], ["leap", 0.008333333333333333], ["disappeared", 0.008333333333333333], ["step", 0.008333333333333333], ["great", 0.008333333333333333], ["kids", 0.008333333333333333], ["ades", 0.008333333333333333], ["universe", 0.008333333333333333], ["adored", 0.008333333333333333], ["place", 0.008333333333333333], ["footsteps", 0.008333333333333333], ["consulting", 0.008333333333333333], ["hearing", 0.008333333333333333], ["feet", 0.008333333333333333], ["set", 0.008333333333333333], ["americans", 0.008333333333333333], ["dwayne", 0.008333333333333333], ["engineer", 0.008333333333333333], ["city", 0.008333333333333333], ["midland", 0.008333333333333333], ["station", 0.008333333333333333], ["tinhorns", 0.008333333333333333], ["formed", 0.008333333333333333], ["eyes", 0.008333333333333333], ["hotel", 0.008333333333333333], ["work", 0.008333333333333333], ["movies", 0.008333333333333333], ["siding", 0.008333333333333333], ["fun", 0.008333333333333333], ["engineers", 0.008333333333333333], ["thought", 0.008333333333333333], ["childhoods", 0.008333333333333333], ["reminded", 0.008333333333333333], ["automatic", 0.008333333333333333], ["development", 0.008333333333333333], ["hoover", 0.008333333333333333], ["temporary", 0.008333333333333333], ["fa", 0.008333333333333333], ["mankind", 0.008333333333333333], ["coming", 0.008333333333333333], ["sneeze", 0.008333333333333333], ["response", 0.008333333333333333], ["building", 0.008333333333333333], ["wife", 0.008333333333333333], ["safely", 0.008333333333333333], ["age", 0.008333333333333333], ["walked", 0.008333333333333333], ["looked", 0.008333333333333333], ["person", 0.008333333333333333], ["qualities", 0.008333333333333333], ["echoes", 0.008333333333333333], ["dream", 0.008333333333333333], ["fact", 0.008333333333333333]], "sentiment": ["Their childhoods were over.

So they walked together, encouraged by the echoes of their footsteps from the building fa\u00e7ades.\nThe manager told Trout a little about what the planet looked like to him. It was a place where he had a wife and two kids, he said. They didn\u2019t know he ran a theater which showed blue movies. They thought he was doing consulting work as an engineer so late at night. He said that the planet didn\u2019t have much use for engineers his age anymore.
