So that game old lady went right in after it.

These were harmless vampire finches going after his bedsores, some of the commonest birds on the island. But to him they were new and terrifying.\nHe slapped at them, and cried out for help. More and more finches kept coming, and he was so convinced that they meant to kill him that he jumped into the water, where he was eaten by a hammerhead shark. This animal had its eyes on the ends of stalks, a design perfected by the Law of Natural Selection many, many millions of years ago. It was a flawless part in the clockwork of the universe.

It will look like this from the back:\nHere is the explanation: There used to be only one Nigger high school in Midland City, and it was an all-Nigger high school still. It was named after Crispus Attucks, a black man who was shot by British troops in Boston in 1770. There was an oil painting of this event in the main corridor of the school. Several white people were stopping bullets, too. Crispus Attucks himself had a hole in his forehead which looked like the front door of a birdhouse.\nBut the black people didn\u2019t call the school Crispus Attucks High School anymore. They called it Innocent Bystander High.\nAnd when another Nigger high school was built after the Second World War, it was named after George Washington Carver, a black man who was born into slavery, but who became a famous chemist anyway.

One night, while the raft was tied up near Manaus, the old rubber boom town in Brazil, a speedboat came alongside. At the wheel was Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the Soviet poet. He had Brazilian friends along. He asked in English if he and his party could come aboard the raft for drinks. In exchange, he said, he would give his hosts a perfect name for their raft.\nSo there was some drinking on the raft, and fighting for some reason broke out between Yevtushenko and Jim.\nSo the party was over, and the visitors got back in their speedboat. Just before they cast off, Yevtushenko said: \u201cI have not forgotten my promise. You should call your raft The Huckleberry Finn.\u201d\nYears later I myself would meet Yevtushenko, and I would ask him if the story was true.\n\u201cAh!\u201d he said. \u201cAh! That was your son?
