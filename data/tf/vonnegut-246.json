Knopf, for example, might give John Updike\u2019s contract to Simon and Schuster, and receive Joan Didion\u2019s contract in return.\nSo we refuse to have me traded to anybody\u2014in a package deal or any other sort of deal.\nSam and Helen have said over and over again that Doubleday wants Dell for its paperback expertise, as though this should have a calming effect on me. And it does calm me, too, in a way, since it means that Doubleday has little more interest in buying me than I have in being sold to them. My being sold to them, if the sale went through, would be a ridiculous, marginal accident happening in the midst of an enormous transfer between millionaires of all sorts of property. So, in order to avoid such an accident, and without depriving Doubleday of anything it particularly wants, we should ask Dell to separate me from the paperback expertise and the filing cabinets.\nI am going to ask the Authors Guild to insist in future contracts that no author\u2019s contract can be handed over to another publisher without the author\u2019s written permission. If the author does not wish to have his future sold to somebody else, then he should be allowed to cancel his contract.
