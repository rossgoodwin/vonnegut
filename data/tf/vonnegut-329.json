KLINKOWITZ\nThe reference to the \u201cperfect fit, so our eyes must have met \u2026\u201d was in response to Klinkowitz asking Kurt if he had been welcomed by British P.O.W.s in the same camp described by the British RAF pilot Geoff Taylor in his book Piece of Cake. Taylor wrote about an influx of American prisoners into the camp, just as Vonnegut wrote about Billy Pilgrim being welcomed by the British P.O.W.s in the German prison camp where he was sent in Slaughterhouse-Five.\nDear Jerry\u2014\nIt is a perfect fit, so our eyes must have met, and he may very briefly have tried to welcome and comfort me. But surely no friendships were formed, no names memorized. Those of us who smoked quickly became wheedling vermin who begged for tobacco along with the precious food. I think he may be off by a couple of days, although he probably kept a diary, and I did not. We spent Christmas locked in boxcars, I remember. The guards outside probably told us it was Christmas. Otherwise we would have had no idea what the date was. My woozy recollection is that we did not reach IVB until five days after that. What could be more trivial, since that war is entirely movies now. And my wife Jill spent a year as a photographer in Vietnam, and I have to laugh when she talks about it and finds that she might as well be a veteran of the Spanish\u2013American War.\nI have just read Bill Keough\u2019s thesis about violence in American humor, which deals with Twain, Bierce, Lardner and me. It\u2019s a beauty, although I am quite an anti-climax. But he says that all of us have found ourselves trapped in box canyons with our jokes, with no notions of how the human condition might be improved. And several critics of my work have said that I give the illusion of knowing how things might be revised without being able to describe such revisions. In short, I am, like many failed pieces of serious music, all gestures, all unkept promises, with no stirring resolutions to come. Conventional resolutions in humorless books, incidentally, consist of the acceptance of some option which the society has offered for quite some time: a meaningful death, the kicking of an addiction, the uncritical acceptance of some religion, becoming a hermit, returning to a person one has loved all along, and so on. Or tending the sick, or helping the poor, or shooting the person who seems most responsible for all the misery.\nWhen I thought I was going to become a biologist of some kind, and in fact studied bacteriology, I wanted to cure diseases, and my heroes were Pasteur and the like. I was going to find out what made people sick. I had no gift for real science, however, and after the Second World War went into pseudo-science, all talk and few measurements, which is to say anthropology. And one enchantingly suggestive thing I learned (attitude I assumed), was that culture was as separate from the brain as a Model T Ford, and could be tinkered with. It was an easy jump from there to believing, as I do, that a culture can contain fatal poisons which can be identified: respect for firearms, for example, or the belief that no male is really a man until he has had a physical showdown of some kind, or that women can\u2019t possibly understand the really important things which are going on, and so on.

And then one night we were watching Channel Two.\u201d Channel Two is the educational television station in Boston. \u201cThere was this discussion going on between some college professors about the different theories of how the solar system had been born.
