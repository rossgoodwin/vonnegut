We will start again. \u201cDa capo,\u201d as you said to me one time, after we had had some falling out, and had to start the friendship over again.\nJane, who has so long sought to renew and reinvigorate herself through magic, through credulousness in the presence of religious quacks, has at last had startling success, I am told, with ordinary therapy. She has always been a wonderful writer, you know, who could write only with painful clumsiness. Now, Edith told me yesterday at lunch, she writes like the wind every day. Her subject: What it was like to already have three kids, and then to adopt three more. Why not? The book could easily be delightful and wise. I wish her nothing but success and happiness.\nAs for Edith: She has a decent studio at last, in what used to be manufacturing space on Twelfth Street, right off Fifth Avenue. She is painting enormous, surrealistic allegories. Yes\u2014she has heard of Goya, and some others, too. There are women carrying men. The men are content to be carried everywhere.\nWhen can we see another book?\nCheers\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut\nP.S.

Tables quaked, and a very kind fat man with a headful of music looked down at the jiggling yolks of his breakfast eggs. His wife was visiting relatives out of town. He was on his own.\nThe kind fat man was George M. Helmholtz, a man of forty, head of the music department of Lincoln High School, and director of the band. Life had treated him well. Each year he dreamed the same big dream. He dreamed of leading as fine a band as there was on the face of the earth. And each year the dream came true.\nIt came true because Helmholtz was sure that a man couldn\u2019t have a better dream than his. Faced by this unnerving sureness, Kiwanians, Rotarians, and Lions paid for band uniforms that cost twice as much as their best suits, school administrators let Helmholtz raid the budget for expensive props, and youngsters played their hearts out for him. When youngsters had no talent, Helmholtz made them play on guts alone.\nEverything was good about Helmholtz\u2019s life save his finances. He was so dazzled by his big dream that he was a child in the marketplace. Ten years before, he had sold the hill behind the restaurant to Bert Quinn, the restaurant owner, for one thousand dollars. It was now apparent, even to Helmholtz, that Helmholtz had been had.\nQuinn sat down in the booth with the bandmaster. He was a bachelor, a small, dark, humorless man. He wasn\u2019t a well man. He couldn\u2019t sleep, he couldn\u2019t stop working, he couldn\u2019t smile warmly. He had only two moods: one suspicious and self-pitying, the other arrogant and boastful. The first mood applied when he was losing money. The second mood applied when he was making it.", 0.16181681681681678], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["harold", 0.3076923076923077], ["lowers", 0.07692307692307693], ["knees", 0.07692307692307693], ["woodly", 0.07692307692307693], ["dead", 0.07692307692307693], ["better", 0.07692307692307693], ["trigger", 0.07692307692307693], ["falters", 0.07692307692307693], ["rifle", 0.07692307692307693], ["squeeze", 0.07692307692307693]], "sentiment": ["No.\n(goes down on his knees) No.\nHAROLD\nGet up.\nWOODLY\nNo.\nHAROLD\nHave it your way.

You want to leave your name?\u201d\n\u201cTell her it\u2019s Bob Counsel,\u201d said Rice. Counsel was the son of a man who had gotten very rich on coin-operated laundries. He spent most of his time at the country club. He was in love with Annie.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t recognize your voice for a minute there, Mr. Counsel,\u201d said the butler. \u201cPlease hold on, sir, if you\u2019d be so kind.\u201d\nSeconds later Annie\u2019s mother was on the phone. She wanted to believe so desperately that the caller was the polite and attractive and respectable Bob Counsel that she didn\u2019t even begin to suspect a fraud. And she did almost all the talking, so Rice had only to grunt from time to time.\n\u201cOh Bob, oh Bob, oh Bob\u2014you dear boy,\u201d she said. \u201cHow nice, how awfully nice of you to call. It was what I was praying for! She has to talk to somebody her own age. Oh, her father and I have talked to her, and I guess she heard us, but there\u2019s such a gap between the generations these days.\n\u201cThis thing\u2014this thing Annie\u2019s been through,\u201d said Annie\u2019s mother, \u201cit\u2019s more like a nervous breakdown than anything else. It isn\u2019t really a nervous breakdown, but she isn\u2019t herself\u2014isn\u2019t the Annie we know. Do you understand what I\u2019m trying to say?\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d said Rice.\n\u201cOh, she\u2019ll be so glad to hear from you, Bob\u2014to know she\u2019s still got her old friends, her real friends to fall back on. Hearing your voice,\u201d said the governor\u2019s wife, \u201cour Annie will know everything\u2019s going to get back to normal again.\u201d\nShe went to get Annie\u2014and had a ding-dong wrangle with her that Rice could hear over the telephone. Annie said she hated Bob Counsel, thought he was a jerk, a stuffed shirt, and a mamma\u2019s boy. Somebody thought to cover the mouthpiece at that point, so Rice didn\u2019t hear anything more until Annie came on the line.", 0.2015], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
