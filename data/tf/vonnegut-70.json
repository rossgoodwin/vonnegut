Turns out the damn things haven\u2019t been made since before the second World War\u2014a lost art. What I was after was a ball ten-inches in diameter, and one guy offered to try and get me one for $150.00! Wow. For the sake of anti-climax, let me say that I finally found an old one for $17.00.\nIs it too soon to wish you a merry Christmas?\nThanks for the money. I mean to get back to that book damn soon.\nA couple of years ago, Max told me that the worst thing that could happen to a young playwright was to have a play produced in a Cape Cod summer theater. Two days ago, he wrote to ask the name of the theater here on the Cape that produces the works of young playwrights. It seems he has a client who is a young playwright.\nI am no longer a young playwright.

I don\u2019t mean people who fell on account of strokes or heart attacks or snapped hamstrings or whatever. I am talking about people ten years old or older, of any race and either sex, and in reasonably good physical condition, who, on a day like any other day, all of a sudden fell down.\nWhen Allie was dying for sure, with not long to go, I could still fill her with joy, could give her an epiphany, if you like, by talking about somebody falling down. My story couldn\u2019t be from the movies or hearsay. It had to be about a rude reminder of the power of gravity that I myself had witnessed.\nOnly one of my stories was about a professional entertainer. It was from back when I was lucky enough to see the death throes of vaudeville on the stage of the Apollo Theater in Indianapolis. A perfectly wonderful man, my kind of saint, as a regular part of his act at one point fell into the orchestra pit, and then climbed back onto the stage wearing the big bass drum.\nAll my other stories, which Allie never tired of hearing until she was dead as a doornail, involved amateurs.\n30\nOne time when Allie was maybe fifteen and I was ten, she heard somebody fall down our basement stairs: Bloompity, bloomp, bloomp. She thought it was I, so she stood at the top of the stairs laughing her fool head off. This would have been 1932, three years into the Great Depression.\nBut it wasn\u2019t I. It was a guy from the gas company, who had come to read the meter. He came clumping out of the basement all bunged up, and absolutely furious.\nAnother time, when Allie was sixteen or older, since she was driving a car with me as a passenger, we saw a woman come out of a stopped streetcar horizontally, headfirst and parallel to the pavement.

Father and I had no lawyer to secure our rights for us. Father refused to call a lawyer. But the district attorney or somebody must have said that I should be sent home without any further monkey business.\nAnyway\u2014after being shown my father, I was told to sit on a hard bench in a corridor and wait. I was left all alone, still covered with ink. I could have walked out of there. Policemen would come by, and hardly give me a glance.\nAnd then a young one in uniform stopped in front of me, acting like somebody who had been told to carry the garbage out, and he said, \u201cOn your feet, killer. I\u2019ve got orders to take you home.\u201d\nThere was a clock on the wall. It was one o\u2019clock in the morning. The law was through with me, except as a witness. Under the law, I was only a witness to my father\u2019s crime of criminal negligence. There would be a coroner\u2019s inquest. I would have to testify.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo this ordinary patrolman drove me home. He kept his eye on the road, but his thoughts were all of me. He said that I would have to think about Mrs. Metzger, lying cold in the ground, for the rest of my life, and that, if he were me, he would probably commit suicide. He said that he expected some relative of Mrs. Metzger would get me sooner or later, when I least expected it\u2014maybe the very next day, or maybe when I was a man, full of hopes and good prospects, and with a family of my own. Whoever did it, he said, would probably want me to suffer some.\nI would have been too addled, too close to death, to get his name, if he hadn\u2019t insisted that I learn it. It was Anthony Squires, and he said it was important that I commit it to memory, since I would undoubtedly want to make a complaint about him, since policemen were expected to speak politely at all times, and that, before he got me home, he was going to call me a little Nazi cocksucker and a dab of catshit and he hadn\u2019t decided what all yet.\nHe explained, too, why he wasn\u2019t in the armed forces, even though he was only twenty-four years old. Both his eardrums were broken, he said, because his father and mother used to beat him up all the time. \u201cThey held my hand over the fire of a gas range once,\u201d he said. \u201cYou ever had that done to you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHigh time,\u201d he said. \u201cOr too late, maybe.

She wasn\u2019t going to allow that to happen again. She had shuddered and swayed to her feet. She now faced the audience and belted out these words in the voice of the toughest truck driver on the turnpike from Hell to Pittsburgh, and only capital letters will do:\n\u201cDO WHAT HE SAYS! THIS MAN IS NONE OTHER THAN JESUS CHRIST!\u201d\nEverybody thought the thug in a muumuu was part of the act!\nBerman was rooted to the stage like a mulberry stump in Barnstable.\nWhat were members of the audience to extrapolate from this situation? They were being tested, they thought. The next move was up to them. What were their alternatives? Any sudden and stentorian announcement about Jesus would have left them momentarily thunderstruck. But now they could evaluate the source: an obvious clown, a man dressed like a woman, and part of the show. So far as they knew, Gil Berman was still completely in charge. So if they did not feel at all like laughing, which they didn\u2019t, that was because he did not want them to laugh. Did he really think he was Jesus? Anyone crazy enough to believe that about himself or herself, as the case might be, would still not have been so crazy as to pay a clown, of all symbols, to announce the fact. Nor had Berman at any point in the evening seemed in the least fire-eyed or messianistic.\nSilence.\nBerman, who couldn\u2019t really have been catatonic, was up there onstage pretending to be catatonic, or so they thought. He wasn\u2019t about to tell them what to do next. They should be able to figure that out for themselves, if they were such a smart bunch of college kids. Applaud with their hands? He had mocked doing that for its quite possible insincerity. Cluck like chickens? Please!\nAnd then they got it, or thought they did: This enemy of hypocrisy up there on stage wanted no hypocrisy from them, should any part of his show have disappointed them. And he was demonstrating that he was as austere about praise as he was about sex. He didn\u2019t need it, didn\u2019t want it.

passed at the high school without at least one unwanted pregnancy, and during the memorable spring semester of 1981 there were six. And, true enough, about half of these babies having babies spoke of true love for those with whom they had mated. But the other half swore, in the face of contradictory evidence which could only be described as overwhelming, that they had never, to the best of their recollection, engaged in any activity which could result in the birth of a child.\nAnd Mary would say to a female colleague at the end of the memorable spring semester of 1981, \u201cFor some people, getting pregnant is as easy as catching cold.\u201d And there certainly was an analogy there: Colds and babies were both caused by germs which loved nothing so much as a mucous membrane.\nAfter ten years on Santa Rosalia Island, Mary Hepburn would discover firsthand exactly how easily a teenage virgin could be made pregnant by the seed of a male who was seeking sexual release and nothing else, who did not even like her.\n23\nSO, WITHOUT ANY IDEA that he was going to become the sire of all humankind, I got into the head of Captain Adolf von Kleist as he rode in a taxicab from Guayaquil International Airport to the Bah\u00eda de Darwin. I did not know that humanity was about to be diminished to a tiny point, by luck, and then, again by luck, to be permitted to expand again. I believed that the chaos involving billions of big-brained people thrashing around every which way, and reproducing and reproducing, would go on and on. It did not seem likely that an individual could be significant in such an unplanned uproar.\nMy choosing the Captain\u2019s head for a vehicle, then, was the equivalent of putting a coin in a slot machine in an enormous gambling casino, and hitting a jackpot right away.\nIt was his uniform which attracted me as much as anything. He was wearing the white-and-gold uniform of a Reserve admiral. I myself had been a private, and so was curious to know what the world looked like to a person of very high military rank and social standing.\nAnd I was mystified to find his big brain thinking about meteorites. That was often my experience back then: I would get into the head of somebody in what to me was a particularly interesting situation, and discover that the person\u2019s big brain was thinking about things which had nothing to do with the problem right at hand.\nHere was the thing about the Captain and meteorites: He had paid little attention to most of his instructors at the United States Naval Academy, and had graduated at the very bottom of his class. He in fact would have been expelled for cheating in an examination on celestial navigation, if his parents hadn\u2019t interceded through diplomatic channels. But he had been impressed by one lecture on the subject of meteorites. The instructor said that showers of great boulders from outer space had been quite common over the eons, and their impacts had been so terrific, possibly, as to have caused the extinction of many life forms, including the dinosaurs. He said that human beings had every reason to expect more such planet smashers at any time, and should devise apparatus for distinguishing between enemy missiles and meteorites.\nOtherwise, utterly meaningless wrath from outer space could trigger World War Three.", 0.16228766588602656], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["hall", 0.02564102564102564], ["fame", 0.021367521367521368],

writer. He thought people might be interested in his side of the story about what happened to him at the network.\nSlazinger said afterwards that there ought to be some way to persuade people like Pomerantz, and the Hamptons teem with people like Pomerantz, that they had already extorted more than enough from the economy. He suggested that we build a Money Hall of Fame out here, with busts of the arbitrageurs and hostile-takeover specialists and venture capitalists and investment bankers and golden handshakers and platinum parachutists in niches, with their statistics cut into stone\u2014how many millions they had stolen legally in how short a time.\nI asked Slazinger if I deserved to be in the Money Hall of Fame. He thought that over, and concluded that I belonged in some sort of Hall of Fame, but that all my money had come as a result of accidents rather than greed.\n\u201cYou belong in the Dumb Luck Hall of Fame,\u201d he said. He thought it should be built in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, maybe, but then changed his mind. \u201cThe Klondike, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should have to come by dogsled or on snowshoes if they want to see Rabo Karabekian\u2019s bust in the Dumb Luck Hall of Fame.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t stand it that I inherited a piece of the Cincinnati Bengals, and don\u2019t give a damn. He is an avid football fan.\n14\nSO FLOYD POMERANTZ\u2019S chauffeur delivered me to the first flagstone of my doorpath. I clambered out of our fancy casket like Count Dracula, blinded by the setting sun. I groped my way to my front door and entered.\nLet me tell you about the foyer I had every right to expect to see. Its walls should have been oyster white, like every square foot of wall space in the entire house, except for the basement and servants\u2019 quarters. Terry Kitchen\u2019s painting \u201cSecret Window\u201d should have loomed before me like the City of God. To my left should have been a Matisse of a woman holding a black cat in her arms and standing before a brick wall covered with yellow roses, which dear Edith had bought fair and square from a gallery as a present to me on our fifth wedding anniversary. On my right should have been a Hans Hofmann which Terry Kitchen got from Philip Guston in trade for one of his own pictures, and which he gave to me after I paid for a new transmission for his babyshit-brown convertible Buick Roadmaster.\nThose who wish to know more about the foyer need only dig out a copy of the February 1981 issue of Architect & Decorator. The foyer is on the cover, is viewed through the open front door from the flagstone walk, which was lined on both sides with hollyhocks back then. The lead article is about the whole house as a masterpiece of redecorating a Victorian house to accommodate modern art. Of the foyer itself it says, \u201cThe Karabekians\u2019 entrance hall alone contains what might serve as the core of a small museum\u2019s permanent collection of modern art, marvelous enough in itself, but in fact a mere hors d\u2019oeuvre before the incredible feast of art treasures awaiting in the high-ceilinged, stark-white rooms beyond.\u201d", 0.15974644403215832], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["love", 0.05555555555555555], ["story", 0.046296296296296294], ["vonnegut", 0.046296296296296294], ["interviewer", 0.046296296296296294], ["stories", 0.046296296296296294], ["talk", 0.037037037037037035], ["loving", 0.027777777777777776], ["thing", 0.027777777777777776], ["outs", 0.018518518518518517], ["life", 0.018518518518518517], ["true", 0.018518518518518517], ["shoot", 0.018518518518518517], ["mechanical", 0.018518518518518517], ["mechanics", 0.009259259259259259], ["things", 0.009259259259259259], ["crazy", 0.009259259259259259], ["final", 0.009259259259259259], ["storytelling", 0.009259259259259259], ["writers", 0.009259259259259259], ["ralph", 0.009259259259259259], ["magnificent", 0.009259259259259259], ["ellison", 0.009259259259259259], ["deep", 0.009259259259259259], ["barbarous", 0.009259259259259259], ["funny", 0.009259259259259259], ["goodness", 0.009259259259259259], ["impossible", 0.009259259259259259], ["find", 0.009259259259259259], ["subject", 0.009259259259259259], ["will", 0.009259259259259259], ["lead", 0.009259259259259259], ["readers", 0.009259259259259259], ["thinking", 0.009259259259259259], ["iii", 0.009259259259259259], ["flying", 0.009259259259259259], ["sky", 0.009259259259259259], ["artificial", 0.009259259259259259], ["write", 0.009259259259259259], ["book", 0.009259259259259259], ["gaga", 0.009259259259259259], ["reader", 0.009259259259259259], ["going", 0.009259259259259259], ["black", 0.009259259259259259], ["war", 0.009259259259259259], ["pleasure", 0.009259259259259259], ["hero", 0.009259259259259259], ["excluded", 0.009259259259259259], ["technocrat", 0.009259259259259259], ["problems", 0.009259259259259259], ["lover", 0.009259259259259259], ["mechanisms", 0.009259259259259259], ["possibility", 0.009259259259259259], ["death", 0.009259259259259259], ["hear", 0.009259259259259259], ["fords", 0.009259259259259259], ["invisible", 0.009259259259259259], ["policeman", 0.009259259259259259], ["model", 0.009259259259259259], ["man", 0.009259259259259259], ["night", 0.009259259259259259], ["tinkered", 0.009259259259259259], ["couldn", 0.009259259259259259], ["cowboy", 0.009259259259259259], ["technical", 0.009259259259259259], ["wins", 0.009259259259259259], ["reliable", 0.009259259259259259], ["work", 0.009259259259259259], ["leading", 0.009259259259259259], ["worth", 0.009259259259259259], ["tale", 0.009259259259259259], ["journey", 0.009259259259259259], ["making", 0.009259259259259259], ["problem", 0.009259259259259259], ["example", 0.009259259259259259], ["saucers", 0.009259259259259259]], "sentiment": ["VONNEGUT: It\u2019s a mechanical problem. So much of what happens in storytelling is mechanical, has to do with the technical problems of how to make a story work. Cowboy stories and policeman stories end in shoot-outs, for example, because shoot-outs are the most reliable mechanisms for making such stories end. There is nothing like death to say what is always such an artificial thing to say: \u201cThe end.\u201d I try to keep deep love out of my stories because, once that particular subject comes up, it is almost impossible to talk about anything else. Readers don\u2019t want to hear about anything else. They go gaga about love. If a lover in a story wins his true love, that\u2019s the end of the tale, even if World War III is about to begin, and the sky is black with flying saucers.\nINTERVIEWER: So you keep love out.\nVONNEGUT: I have other things I want to talk about. Ralph Ellison did the same thing in Invisible Man. If the hero in that magnificent book had found somebody worth loving, somebody who was crazy about him, that would have been the end of the story. C\u00e9line did the same thing in Journey to the End of the Night: He excluded the possibility of true and final love\u2014so that the story could go on and on and on.\nINTERVIEWER: Not many writers talk about the mechanics of stories.\nVONNEGUT: I am such a barbarous technocrat that I believe they can be tinkered with like Model T Fords.\nINTERVIEWER: To what end?\nVONNEGUT: To give the reader pleasure.\nINTERVIEWER: Will you ever write a love story, do you think?\nVONNEGUT: Maybe.

He carries Melody around in his arms on days like that, and has offered to carry me.\nThe Raspberries are food-gatherers, mainly, living in and around the ruins of the New York Stock Exchange.

ships in the night on the Quadrangle. It would be our last encounter there. Without either of us knowing that it would be the last time, she said something that in retrospect is quite moving to me. What she said was derived from our exploratory conversation at the cocktail party that had welcomed us to the faculty so long ago.\nI had told her about how I met Sam Wakefield at the Cleveland Science Fair, and what the first words were that he ever spoke to me. Now, as I hastened to my doom, she played back those words to me: \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry, Son?\u201d\n13\nTHE CHAIRMAN OF the Board of Trustees that fired me 10 years ago was Robert W. Moellenkamp of West Palm Beach, himself a graduate of Tarkington and the father of 2 Tarkingtonians, 1 of whom had been my student. As it happened, he was on the verge of losing his fortune, which was nothing but paper, in Microsecond Arbitrage, Incorporated. That swindle claimed to be snapping up bargains in food and shelter and clothing and fuel and medicine and raw materials and machinery and so on before people who really needed them could learn of their existence. And then the company\u2019s computers, supposedly, would get the people who really needed whatever it was to bid against each other, running profits right through the roof. It was able to do this with its clients\u2019 money, supposedly, because its computers were linked by satellites to marketplaces in every corner of the world.\nThe computers, it would turn out, weren\u2019t connected to anything but each other and their credulous clients like Tarkington\u2019s Board Chairman. He was high as a kite on printouts describing brilliant trades he had made in places like Tierra del Fuego and Uganda and God knows where else, when he agreed with the Panjandrum of American Conservatism, Jason Wilder, that it was time to fire me. Microsecond Arbitrage was his angel dust, his LSD, his heroin, his jug of Thunderbird wine, his cocaine.\nI MYSELF HAVE been addicted to older women and housekeeping, which my court-appointed lawyer tells me might be germs we could make grow into a credible plea of insanity. The most amazing thing to him was that I had never masturbated.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s father made me promise never to do it, because it would make me lazy and crazy,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd you believed him?\u201d he said. He is only 23 years old, fresh out of Syracuse.\nAnd I said, \u201cCounselor, in these fast-moving times, with progress gone hog-wild, grandfathers are bound to be wrong about everything.\u201d", 0.1377542969850662], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["plummer", 0.061224489795918366], ["helmholtz", 0.04081632653061224], ["boy", 0.027210884353741496], ["paper", 0.02040816326530612], ["day", 0.013605442176870748], ["growing", 0.013605442176870748], ["music", 0.013605442176870748], ["sort", 0.013605442176870748], ["bygones", 0.013605442176870748], ["room", 0.013605442176870748], ["challenge", 0.013605442176870748], ["sitting", 0.013605442176870748], ["finding", 0.013605442176870748], ["lower", 0.013605442176870748], ["cried", 0.006802721088435374], ["pointed", 0.006802721088435374], ["throated", 0.006802721088435374], ["chair", 0.006802721088435374], ["carpet", 0.006802721088435374], ["impact", 0.006802721088435374], ["painfully", 0.006802721088435374], ["front", 0.006802721088435374], ["lining", 0.006802721088435374], ["silver", 0.006802721088435374], ["late", 0.006802721088435374], ["thump", 0.006802721088435374], ["covered", 0.006802721088435374], ["sinking", 0.006802721088435374], ["customers", 0.006802721088435374], ["evening", 0.006802721088435374], ["crash", 0.006802721088435374], ["gestured", 0.006802721088435374], ["dam", 0.006802721088435374], ["bandmaster", 0.006802721088435374], ["patted", 0.006802721088435374], ["records", 0.006802721088435374], ["telling", 0.006802721088435374], ["awaiting", 0.006802721088435374], ["shoulder", 0.006802721088435374], ["school", 0.006802721088435374], ["sighed", 0.006802721088435374], ["sidewalk", 0.006802721088435374], ["straight", 0.006802721088435374], ["people", 0.006802721088435374], ["house", 0.006802721088435374], ["hard", 0.006802721088435374], ["year", 0.006802721088435374], ["kinds", 0.006802721088435374], ["chuckle", 0.006802721088435374], ["bass", 0.006802721088435374], ["delivered", 0.006802721088435374], ["god", 0.006802721088435374], ["kind", 0.006802721088435374], ["hastily", 0.006802721088435374], ["knife", 0.006802721088435374], ["chose", 0.006802721088435374], ["business", 0.006802721088435374], ["water", 0.006802721088435374], ["hurts", 0.006802721088435374], ["throbbing", 0.006802721088435374], ["depended", 0.006802721088435374], ["search", 0.006802721088435374], ["drum", 0.006802721088435374], ["couldn", 0.006802721088435374], ["route", 0.006802721088435374], ["hours", 0.006802721088435374], ["thing", 0.006802721088435374], ["afternoon", 0.006802721088435374], ["musically", 0.006802721088435374], ["diameter", 0.006802721088435374], ["feet", 0.006802721088435374], ["george", 0.006802721088435374], ["stuck", 0.006802721088435374], ["fast", 0.006802721088435374], ["clapboards", 0.006802721088435374], ["paint", 0.006802721088435374], ["wonderful", 0.006802721088435374], ["bitter", 0.006802721088435374], ["headache", 0.006802721088435374], ["eyes", 0.006802721088435374], ["lived", 0.006802721088435374], ["door", 0.006802721088435374], ["shrubbery", 0.006802721088435374], ["delivery", 0.006802721088435374], ["true", 0.006802721088435374], ["keeping", 0.006802721088435374], ["stories", 0.006802721088435374], ["newspaper", 0.006802721088435374], ["pictures", 0.006802721088435374], ["walter", 0.006802721088435374], ["slippers", 0.006802721088435374], ["beautiful", 0.006802721088435374], ["process", 0.006802721088435374], ["mind", 0.006802721088435374], ["head", 0.006802721088435374], ["deep", 0.006802721088435374], ["comfortable", 0.006802721088435374], ["imitation", 0.006802721088435374], ["flammer", 0.006802721088435374], ["sell", 0.006802721088435374], ["sir", 0.006802721088435374], ["shuffled", 0.006802721088435374], ["sit", 0.006802721088435374], ["write", 0.006802721088435374], ["instance", 0.006802721088435374], ["chest", 0.006802721088435374], ["boom", 0.006802721088435374], ["papers", 0.006802721088435374], ["amiable", 0.006802721088435374], ["living", 0.006802721088435374], ["moment", 0.006802721088435374], ["friends", 0.006802721088435374], ["life", 0.006802721088435374], ["walked", 0.006802721088435374], ["face", 0.006802721088435374], ["edge", 0.006802721088435374], ["hurled", 0.006802721088435374], ["time", 0.006802721088435374], ["talk", 0.006802721088435374]], "sentiment": ["Mr. George M. Helmholtz lived in a world of music, and even the throbbing of his headache came to him musically, if painfully, as the deep-throated boom of a bass drum seven feet in diameter. It was late afternoon on the first challenge day of the new school year. He was sitting in his living room, his eyes covered, awaiting another sort of thump\u2014the impact of the evening paper, hurled against the clapboards of the front of the house by Walter Plummer, the delivery boy.\nAs Mr. Helmholtz was telling himself that he would rather not have his newspaper on challenge day, since Plummer came with it, the paper was delivered with a crash.\n\u201cPlummer!\u201d he cried.\n\u201cYes, sir?\u201d said Plummer from the sidewalk.\nMr. Helmholtz shuffled to the door in his carpet slippers. \u201cPlease, my boy,\u201d he said, \u201ccan\u2019t we be friends?\u201d\n\u201cSure\u2014why not?\u201d said Plummer. \u201cLet bygones be bygones, is what I say.\u201d He gave a bitter imitation of an amiable chuckle. \u201cWater over the dam. It\u2019s been two hours now since you stuck the knife in me.\u201d\nMr. Helmholtz sighed. \u201cHave you got a moment? It\u2019s time we had a talk, my boy.\u201d\nPlummer hid his papers under the shrubbery, and walked in. Mr. Helmholtz gestured at the most comfortable chair in the room, the one in which he\u2019d been sitting. Plummer chose to sit on the edge of a hard one with a straight back instead.\n\u201cMy boy,\u201d said the bandmaster, \u201cGod made all kinds of people: some who can run fast, some who can write wonderful stories, some who can paint pictures, some who can sell anything, some who can make beautiful music. But He didn\u2019t make anybody who could do everything well. Part of the growing-up process is finding out what we can do well and what we can\u2019t do well.\u201d He patted Plummer\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe last part, finding out what we can\u2019t do, is what hurts most about growing up. But everybody has to face it, and then go in search of his true self.\u201d\nPlummer\u2019s head was sinking lower and lower on his chest, and Mr. Helmholtz hastily pointed out a silver lining. \u201cFor instance, Flammer could never run a business like a paper route, keeping records, getting new customers.

The dream of catching a unicorn ran through the drab fabric of the lives of the father and son like a golden thread.\nBoth knew there were no unicorns in England. But they\u2019d agreed to madness\u2014to live as though there were unicorns around; as though Ethelbert were going to catch one any day; as though the scrawny family would soon be stuffing itself with meat, selling the precious horn for a fortune, living happily ever after.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been saying you\u2019d come and see it for a year,\u201d said Ethelbert.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been busy,\u201d said Elmer.

Elmer wanted to go on thinking of it as big and promising, too. There was no hope anywhere else.\nElmer kissed his son\u2019s hands, and sniffed the mingled smells of flesh and earth. \u201cI\u2019ll come see it soon,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d have enough left over from them horse drapes to make drawers for you and little Ethelbert,\u201d said Ivy, still enchanted. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you two be the ones, though, with blue drawers all shot through with them little gold crosses?\u201d\n\u201cIvy,\u201d said Elmer patiently, \u201cI wish you\u2019d get it through your head\u2014Robert really is horrible. He isn\u2019t going to give you the drapes off his horse.
