Wright Mills.\nDear Knox:\n[\u2026] Collier\u2019s, in taking its stand in favor of big business, has sided with one of two forms of socialism being forced on the people of this country. Only question is who\u2019s going to administer the enervating paternalism, the humiliating paternalism. As is shrewdly pointed out in White Collar, bureaucracy is nothing more than modern business practice applied to government. I think big business is a terrible thing for the spirit of the country, as our spirit is the best thing about us. Making us a nation of ass kissers. Only way, or virtually the only way, to get ahead these days. Deadly.

nephews what he thought of my dancing. He said, \u201cAcceptable.\u201d\nWhen I took a job in Boston as an advertising copywriter, because I was broke, an account executive asked me what kind of name Vonnegut was. I said, \u201cGerman.\u201d He said, \u201cGermans killed six million of my cousins.\u201d\nYou want to know why I don\u2019t have AIDS, why I\u2019m not HIV-positive like so many other people? I don\u2019t fuck around. It\u2019s as simple as that.\nTrout said this was the story on why AIDS and new strains of syph and clap and the blueballs were making the rounds like Avon ladies run amok: On September 1st of 1945, immediately after the end of World War Two, representatives of all the chemical elements held a meeting on the planet Tralfamadore. They were there to protest some of their members\u2019 having been incorporated into the bodies of big, sloppy, stinky organisms as cruel and stupid as human beings.\nElements such as Polonium and Ytterbium, which had never been essential parts of human beings, were nonetheless outraged that any chemicals should be so misused.\nCarbon, although an embarrassed veteran of countless massacres throughout history, focused the attention of the meeting on the public execution of only one man, accused of treason in fifteenth-century England. He was hanged until almost dead. He was revived. His abdomen was slit open.\nThe executioner pulled out a loop of his intestines. He dangled the loop before the man\u2019s face and burned it with a torch here and there. The loop was still attached to the rest of the man\u2019s insides. The executioner and his assistants tied a horse to each of his four limbs.\nThey whipped the horses, which ripped the man into four jagged pieces. These were hung on display from meathooks in a marketplace.\nIt had been agreed before the meeting was called to order that no one was to tell of terrible things grown-up human beings had done to children, according to Trout. Several delegates threatened to boycott the meeting if they were expected to sit still while listening to tales that sickening. What would be the point?\n\u201cWhat grownups had done to grownups left no doubt that the human race should be exterminated,\u201d said Trout. \u201cRehashing ad nauseam what grownups had done to children would be gilding the lily, so to speak.\u201d", -0.16447510822510822], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["nancy", 0.06896551724137931], ["telephone", 0.05172413793103448], ["monkey", 0.034482758620689655], ["door", 0.034482758620689655], ["traced", 0.017241379310344827], ["ringing", 0.017241379310344827], ["family", 0.017241379310344827], ["house", 0.017241379310344827], ["private", 0.017241379310344827], ["agents", 0.017241379310344827], ["booth", 0.017241379310344827], ["christian", 0.017241379310344827], ["police", 0.017241379310344827], ["fit", 0.017241379310344827], ["choking", 0.017241379310344827], ["things", 0.017241379310344827], ["answered", 0.017241379310344827], ["parts", 0.017241379310344827], ["call", 0.017241379310344827], ["poet", 0.017241379310344827], ["hidden", 0.017241379310344827], ["tapped", 0.017241379310344827], ["pill", 0.017241379310344827], ["naggingly", 0.017241379310344827], ["enforcement", 0.017241379310344827], ["started", 0.017241379310344827], ["faintly", 0.017241379310344827], ["springtime", 0.017241379310344827], ["nation", 0.017241379310344827], ["delight", 0.017241379310344827], ["phone", 0.017241379310344827], ["hear", 0.017241379310344827], ["imagine", 0.017241379310344827], ["law", 0.017241379310344827], ["monkeys", 0.017241379310344827], ["knock", 0.017241379310344827], ["sheriff", 0.017241379310344827], ["johnson", 0.017241379310344827], ["developing", 0.017241379310344827], ["straight", 0.017241379310344827], ["howard", 0.017241379310344827], ["upset", 0.017241379310344827], ["edgar", 0.017241379310344827], ["mary", 0.017241379310344827], ["um", 0.017241379310344827], ["billy", 0.017241379310344827], ["soundproof", 0.017241379310344827], ["believed", 0.017241379310344827], ["grab", 0.017241379310344827], ["squeals", 0.017241379310344827], ["playing", 0.017241379310344827]], "sentiment": ["\"Um.\" Nancy could hear the telephone ringing faintly, naggingly, through the nearly soundproof door.\n\"So we went on to the monkey house together, and what do you think we saw?\"\n\"I can\u2019t imagine.\" Somebody had answered the phone.\n\"We saw a monkey playing with his private parts!\"\n\"No!\"\n\"Yes! and J.

the open door of the room of the beloved Hope. He paused for a moment to listen to her breathing.\nPinned to his bedsheet was a typewritten note signed by Annie. There was a certain sweetness in his slumber, for before he closed his eyes, he concluded that insofar as disciplinary measures went, the General must have reached the limits of his imagination. He even managed a soft chuckle as he bunched his shirt under his head. \u201cNo pillow for three months,\u201d the note had said.\nHaley\u2019s conclusion was an accurate one, apparently, for nothing new in the way of punishments was forthcoming during the next two weeks. True, Haley was reminded again that his defections had killed his opportunities in the world of music; Hope was ordered to fill out application papers for a Miss Dingman\u2019s School for Ladies, located on an inaccessible ridge in the White Mountains; and Haley\u2019s, Hope\u2019s, and Kitty\u2019s pillows remained under padlock in the basement fruit locker\u2014but no more devastation seemed likely.\nKitty flounced and pined about the house, but without conviction.

This was disturbing to Hope and Haley, for the General took it as a demonstration of his infallible judgment. \u201cWhatever became of that nice Flemming boy and his gasoline bicycle?\u201d he would chortle at mealtimes. \u201cNever seems to show his intelligent face around here anymore.\u201d Kitty offered no rebuttal.\nAs the time for Hope\u2019s incarceration in the New Hampshire highlands drew near, she abandoned her stoicism to plead with the General to relent. It was after dinner one night, and Haley listened with excitement, for if Hope could win leniency, then so might he.\nThe General gave her his thoughtful attention, nodding now and then at her more salient arguments. \u201cAre you through?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes, I guess so.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh, very moving,\u201d he said. He looked seriously from Hope to Haley and back again. \u201cI once knew a man, grew up with him, in fact,\u201d said the General. \u201cWhen he was a boy, his parents would threaten to take away his bicycle if he did something bad. Well, sir, he\u2019d go right ahead and do whatever bad thing it was, and they\u2019d let him keep his bicycle anyway. They didn\u2019t have the heart to take it away. Instead, they\u2019d tell him if he did it again, they wouldn\u2019t let him have any ice cream for a year. He\u2019d do it again, and they wouldn\u2019t have the heart to keep him from eating ice cream. And so it went; his parents would make terrible threats, but they never carried them out, not one.\u201d\n\u201cSo what happened to him finally?\u201d asked the indispensable Annie.\n\u201cHe was shot while robbing a bank,\u201d said the General. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll always say it was his parents who killed him.\u201d", 0.05336052836052834], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["hope", 0.03289473684210526], ["haley", 0.02631578947368421], ["annie", 0.02631578947368421], ["general", 0.019736842105263157], ["man", 0.019736842105263157], ["kitty", 0.013157894736842105], ["work", 0.013157894736842105], ["doorframe", 0.013157894736842105], ["kitchen", 0.013157894736842105], ["cheese", 0.013157894736842105], ["fancy", 0.013157894736842105], ["eat", 0.013157894736842105], ["mess", 0.013157894736842105], ["walked", 0.013157894736842105], ["clean", 0.013157894736842105], ["time", 0.013157894736842105], ["moments", 0.006578947368421052], ["telephoning", 0.006578947368421052], ["shrugged", 0.006578947368421052], ["toothpick", 0.006578947368421052], ["mingling", 0.006578947368421052], ["fit", 0.006578947368421052], ["window", 0.006578947368421052], ["going", 0.006578947368421052], ["primly", 0.006578947368421052], ["complaint", 0.006578947368421052], ["hit", 0.006578947368421052], ["rules", 0.006578947368421052], ["heard", 0.006578947368421052], ["feels", 0.006578947368421052], ["trouble", 0.006578947368421052], ["hall", 0.006578947368421052], ["condition", 0.006578947368421052], ["cool", 0.006578947368421052], ["heaven", 0.006578947368421052], ["realist", 0.006578947368421052], ["potatoes", 0.006578947368421052], ["gun", 0.006578947368421052], ["peered", 0.006578947368421052], ["bad", 0.006578947368421052], ["spotless", 0.006578947368421052], ["night", 0.006578947368421052], ["small", 0.006578947368421052], ["monopolized", 0.006578947368421052], ["meal", 0.006578947368421052], ["ears", 0.006578947368421052], ["force", 0.006578947368421052], ["savored", 0.006578947368421052], ["deal", 0.006578947368421052], ["house", 0.006578947368421052], ["nail", 0.006578947368421052], ["picked", 0.006578947368421052], ["click", 0.006578947368421052], ["barn", 0.006578947368421052], ["business", 0.006578947368421052], ["chicago", 0.006578947368421052], ["nosing", 0.006578947368421052], ["ice", 0.006578947368421052], ["softly", 0.006578947368421052], ["countenances", 0.006578947368421052], ["promised", 0.006578947368421052], ["supposed", 0.006578947368421052], ["adventuresome", 0.006578947368421052], ["scythe", 0.006578947368421052], ["innocence", 0.006578947368421052], ["nightfall", 0.006578947368421052], ["leftover", 0.006578947368421052], ["melodrama", 0.006578947368421052], ["boy", 0.006578947368421052], ["stone", 0.006578947368421052], ["leaves", 0.006578947368421052], ["conversation", 0.006578947368421052], ["place", 0.006578947368421052], ["receiver", 0.006578947368421052], ["receding", 0.006578947368421052], ["asked", 0.006578947368421052], ["love", 0.006578947368421052], ["win", 0.006578947368421052], ["straining", 0.006578947368421052], ["guard", 0.006578947368421052], ["honing", 0.006578947368421052], ["heads", 0.006578947368421052], ["sake", 0.006578947368421052], ["top", 0.006578947368421052], ["long", 0.006578947368421052], ["trigger", 0.006578947368421052], ["music", 0.006578947368421052], ["loving", 0.006578947368421052], ["eyes", 0.006578947368421052], ["dampness", 0.006578947368421052], ["flight", 0.006578947368421052], ["wieners", 0.006578947368421052], ["tool", 0.006578947368421052], ["great", 0.006578947368421052], ["hurt", 0.006578947368421052], ["hut", 0.006578947368421052], ["catch", 0.006578947368421052], ["hurry", 0.006578947368421052], ["attaboy", 0.006578947368421052], ["blade", 0.006578947368421052], ["told", 0.006578947368421052], ["suppose", 0.006578947368421052], ["icebox", 0.006578947368421052], ["called", 0.006578947368421052], ["shook", 0.006578947368421052], ["expedition", 0.006578947368421052], ["head", 0.006578947368421052], ["talking", 0.006578947368421052], ["cone", 0.006578947368421052], ["warmly", 0.006578947368421052], ["cream", 0.006578947368421052], ["farmhands", 0.006578947368421052], ["disconsolately", 0.006578947368421052], ["hand", 0.006578947368421052], ["helping", 0.006578947368421052], ["rested", 0.006578947368421052], ["arose", 0.006578947368421052], ["supper", 0.006578947368421052], ["meals", 0.006578947368421052], ["thoughts", 0.006578947368421052], ["remember", 0.006578947368421052], ["shotgun", 0.006578947368421052], ["life", 0.006578947368421052], ["hungry", 0.006578947368421052], ["thought", 0.006578947368421052], ["sunset", 0.006578947368421052], ["left", 0.006578947368421052]], "sentiment": ["He was realist enough to know that the ice cream cone was a small one, hut hungry enough to make a great deal of it in his fancy. Honing his scythe in the cool dampness of the tool shed, he savored again the moments when Hope had seemed to look at him warmly. His expedition to Chicago had made him more of a man in her melodrama-loving eyes, he thought. If he had made a mess of his flight, it had at least been an adventuresome mess, not in a boy\u2019s world but in a man\u2019s. With the clean music of the blade against the stone mingling with his thoughts, Haley promised himself that he was indeed man enough to win the love of Hope.\nDuring supper, Annie monopolized the conversation with a new complaint. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get enough to eat, for Heaven\u2019s sake say so.\u201d she said. \u201cBut don\u2019t let me catch anybody nosing around the icebox between meals. It\u2019s getting so bad that I never know when I\u2019m going to have enough on hand for a meal, with everybody helping himself or herself whenever he or she feels like it.\u201d She shrugged disconsolately. \u201cThese potatoes were supposed to have cheese on top of them, but somebody walked off with all the cheese last night, and some leftover wieners, too.\u201d\n\u201cWell, which one of you did it?\u201d asked the General, looking from Kitty to Hope to Haley, all of whom shook their heads and showed the long countenances of hurt innocence. \u201cThe trouble with you is that you all eat like farmhands, but not one of you\u2019ll work like one.\u201d\n\u201cYou certainly hit the nail on the head that time,\u201d said Annie.\nThe General arose, walked over to the kitchen window, and peered out at the barn, which was receding into nightfall. He picked up the shotgun from its place by the doorframe. \u201cAttaboy, Haley,\u201d he said at last, \u201ckeep her spotless. Get Annie to give you a toothpick sometime, so you can clean up some of the fancy work around the trigger guard.\u201d He rested the gun against the doorframe once more, and left the kitchen.\n\u201cHe\u2019s telephoning somebody,\u201d said Kitty. \u201cWho do you suppose it is?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell,\u201d said Hope. \u201cHe\u2019s talking softly for the first time in his life.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of our business, or he would have seen fit to tell us about it,\u201d said Annie primly.\n\u201cWhoever it is,\u201d said Hope, straining her ears, \u201che told them not to hurry.\u201d\nHaley heard the click of the receiver, and the General called from the hall, \u201cRemember, the rules are still in force.

Lee Masters and Jane Addams and Louis Sullivan and Lake Michigan, and on and on.\nAnd I propose a toast to an individual who wasn\u2019t an artist or working stiff of any description. She wasn\u2019t even a human being. Ladies and gentlemen of Chicago, I give you Mrs. O\u2019Leary\u2019s cow12.\nWHAT THE \u201cGHOST DANCE\u201d OF THE NATIVE AMERICANS AND THE CUBIST MOVEMENT OF FRENCH PAINTERS HAD IN COMMON\nIn which Vonnegut tells how his own fiction writing was inspired by the professor who was \u201clow man on the totem pole\u201d in the University of Chicago Anthropology Department.13\nA young woman told me a couple of years ago that she had applied for admission here. The man who interviewed her asked her why she had found the place attractive. She said it was because Philip Roth and I had both gone here, along with many other considerations, of course. He replied that Philip and I were precisely the sorts of persons who never should have gone here. What could he have meant by that? If he is in this audience, I would appreciate meeting and talking to him afterwards.\nI came here14 in 1946, immediately following my participation in a war. It was the Second World War, a name and event worthy of H.G. Wells. That war ended with our dropping atomic bombs on the civilians, and their pets and house plants, of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, quite a surprise to one and all. That such bombs were possible was first demonstrated in the abandoned football stadium of this very university, where the importance of contact sports had been discounted. The university president at that time, Robert Maynard Hutchins, was famous for saying that, whenever he felt in need of exercise, he lay down until the feeling passed. He finally wound up in a California think tank.\nSo far as I know, the only Second World War weapon worth a nickel to come out of Harvard, which thinks it\u2019s such hot stuff, was Napalm or jellied gasoline.\nI came here from Indianapolis. In those days, that was like a provincial Frenchman\u2019s coming to Paris, or an Austrian bumpkin\u2019s coming to Vienna, or, as in the case of Adolf Hitler, to Munich, Germany.\nIn those days, thanks again to Robert Maynard Hutchins, the undergraduate course consisted of only two years devoted to a study of the so-called Great Books. Philip Roth is a product of that short course. We would not meet until many years afterwards. The graduate school was everything past what would have been the sophomore year at other American institutions. Like many returning veterans with more than two years\u2019 worth of credits from someplace else, I was admitted to this unconventional graduate school, with three or four years to go before qualifying for an MA.\nThe credits I brought with me were near-flunks in chemistry, physics, math, and biology. I had actually twice flunked a course whose purpose is to exclude people like me from careers as scientists, which is thermodynamics.", 0.15276809910956252], "title": "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"},

"sentiment": ["I have already given my own opinion as to the cause for the craze back then for having machines do everything that human beings did\u2014and I mean everything. I just want to add that my father, who was a science-fiction writer, once wrote a novel about a man whom everybody laughed at because he was building sports robots. He created a golf robot who could make a hole in one every time, and a basketball robot who could hit the basket every time, and a tennis robot who served an ace every time, and so on.\nAt first, people couldn\u2019t see any use for robots like that, and the inventor\u2019s wife walked out on him, the way Father\u2019s wife, incidentally, had walked out on him\u2014and his children tried to put him into a nuthouse. But then he let advertisers know that his robots would also endorse automobiles or beer or razors or wristwatches or perfume or whatever. He made a fortune, according to my father, because so many sports enthusiasts wanted to be exactly like those robots.\nDon\u2019t ask me why.\n15\n*ANDREW MACINTOSH, meanwhile, was in his blind daughter\u2019s room, waiting for the telephone to ring\u2014to bring him the good news which he would then share with the Hiroguchis. He was fluent in Spanish, and he had been on the telephone all afternoon with his offices on the island of Manhattan and with frightened Ecuadorian financiers and officials. He was doing business in his daughter\u2019s room because he wanted her to hear what he was doing. These two were very close. Selena had never known a mother, since her mother had died while giving birth to her.\nI think of Selena now, with her meaningless green eyes, as an experiment by Nature\u2014since her blindness was inherited and she could pass it on. She was eighteen there in Guayaquil, with her best reproductive years ahead of her. She would be only twenty-eight when Mary Hepburn asked her if she would like to take part in her unauthorized experiments on Santa Rosalia with the Captain\u2019s sperm. Selena would refuse. But if she had found any advantages in blindness, she could have passed them on.\nLittle did young Selena know in Guayaquil, as she listened to her sociopathic father wheel and deal on the telephone, that her destiny was to pair off with Hisako Hiroguchi, two rooms away, and to raise a furry baby.\nIn Guayaquil she was paired off with her father, who apparently owned the planet they were on, and who could do whatever he pleased whenever he pleased, and wherever he pleased. Her big brain told her that she was going to get through life safely and amusingly inside a sort of electromagnetic bubble created by her father\u2019s indomitable personality, which would continue to protect her even after he died\u2014even after it came to be his turn to enter the blue tunnel into the Afterlife.\nBefore I forget: On Santa Rosalia, Selena\u2019s blindness gave her one advantage over all the other colonists which was a great joy to her, but which, nonetheless, was not worth passing on to yet another generation:\nMore than anybody else on the island, Selena enjoyed the feel of little Akiko\u2019s fur.", 0.21727941176470586], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["draw", 0.023809523809523808], ["mussolini", 0.014285714285714285], ["angel", 0.014285714285714285],

I told her if she ever even mentioned the barn again, I was going to tell everybody that she was really Polly Madison\u2014invite the local papers to come on over and interview her, and so on. If I actually did that, it would not only wreck Paul Slazinger: it would also attract a lynch mob of religious fundamentalists to our doorstep.\nI happened to watch the sermon of a television evangelist the other night, and he said Satan was making a four-pronged attack on the American family with communism, drugs, rock and roll, and books by Satan\u2019s sister, who was Polly Madison.\nTo return to my correspondence with Marilee Kemp: My notes to her cooled after father denounced her as the new Vartan Mamigonian. I was no longer counting on her for anything. Simply as part of the growing-up process, I didn\u2019t want her to go on trying to be my substitute mother. I was becoming a man, and didn\u2019t need a mother anymore, or so I thought.\nWithout any help from her, in fact, I had started to make money as an artist, as young as I was, and right there in bankrupt little San Ignacio. I had gone to the local paper, the Luma County Clarion, looking for work of any kind after school, and had mentioned that I could draw pretty well. The editor asked me if I could draw a picture of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Dan Gregory\u2019s hero of heroes, incidentally, and I did so in two or three minutes maybe, without having to refer to a photograph.\nThen he had me draw a beautiful female angel, and I did that.\nThen he had me draw a picture of Mussolini pouring a quart of something into the mouth of the angel. He had me label the bottle CASTOR OIL and the angel WORLD PEACE. Mussolini liked to punish people by making them drink a quart of castor oil. That sounded like a comical way to teach somebody a lesson, but it wasn\u2019t. The victims often vomited and shit themselves to death. Those who survived were all torn up inside.\nThat is how I became a paid political cartoonist at a tender age. I did one cartoon a week, with the editor telling me exactly what to draw.\nMuch to my surprise, Father began to blossom as an artist, too. In all the guessing about where my artistic talent might have come from, one thing seemed certain: it hadn\u2019t come from him or from anybody on his side of the family. When he still had his shoe repair shop, I never saw him do anything imaginative with all the scraps lying around, maybe make a fancy belt for me or a purse for Mother. He was a no-nonsense repairman, and that was all.\nBut then, as though he were in a trance, and using the simplest hand-tools, he began to make perfectly beautiful cowboy boots, which he sold from door to door. They weren\u2019t only tough and comfortable: they were dazzling jewelry for manly feet and calves, scintillating with gold and silver stars and eagles and flowers and bucking broncos cut from flattened tin cans and bottle caps.\nBut this new development in his life wasn\u2019t as nice for me to see as you might think.", 0.19943532547699214], "title": "Bluebeard"},

So then FBI scientists stuffed banana peels up their asses to find out if this was true or not. Or so we hoped.\nPeople are so afraid. Take the man, with no address, who wrote:\nIf you knew that a man posed a danger to you\u2014maybe he had a gun in his pocket, and you felt that he would not hesitate one moment to use it on you\u2014what would you do? We know Iraq poses a threat to us, to the rest of the world. Why do we sit here and pretend we are protected? That is exactly what happened with al-Qaeda and 9/11. With Iraq, though, the threat is on a much larger scale. Should we sit back, be little children that sit in fear and just wait?\nI wrote back:\nPlease, for the sake of us all, get a shotgun, preferably a 12-gauge double-barrel, and right there in your own neighborhood blow off the heads of people, cops excepted, who may be armed.\nA man from Little Deer Isle, Maine wrote me and asked:\nWhat genuinely motivates al-Qaeda to kill and self-destruct? The president says, \u201cThey hate our freedoms\u201d\u2014our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other, which surely is not what has been learned from the captives being held in Guantanamo, or what he is told in his briefings. Why do the communications industry and our elected politicians allow Bush to get away with such nonsense? And how can there ever be peace, and even trust in our leaders, if the American people aren\u2019t told the truth?\nWell, one wishes that those who took over our federal government, and hence the world, by means of a Mickey Mouse coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, who disconnected all the burglar alarms prescribed by the Constitution, which is to say the House and Senate, and the Supreme Court, and We, the People, were truly Christian.

Rogers ended and the life of General Douglas MacArthur began. The senior senator from California was Mickey Mouse, who would serve with great distinction as a bombardier in the Pacific during the Second World War. Commander Mouse dropped a bomb right down the smokestack of a Japanese battleship. The captain of the battleship was Charlie Chan. Boy, was he mad.\n\u201cWhat a shame that there are so many young people here who never saw J. Edgar Hoover on the silver screen. This was a man fourteen feet high who could not be bribed. Imagine a man who loved this country so much that he could not be bribed, except for some minor carpentry on his house. You can\u2019t adore such integrity without the magic of the silver screen.\n\u201cWas the Sun any good when I was here? I don\u2019t know, and I am afraid to find out. I remember I spelled the first name of Ethel Barrymore \u2019E-T-H-Y-L\u2019 one time\u2014in a headline.\n\u201cIn preparation for this event, I had lunch last week with the best editor in chief I worked under here. That was Miller Harris, who is one year older than I am. I would sure hate to be as old as he is. I wouldn\u2019t mind being as old as E. B. White, if I could actually be E. B. White. Miller Harris is president of the Eagle Shirtmakers now. I ordered a shirt from him one time, and he sent me a bill for one one-hundred-forty-fourth of a gross.\n\u201cHe said at lunch that the Sun in our day was without question the finest student paper in the United States of America. It would be nice if that were true. Eagle shirts, I know, are the greatest shirts in the world.\n\u201cI was shattered, I remember, during my sophomore year here, when a world traveler said that Cornell was the forty-ninth greatest university in the world. I had hoped we would at least be in the high teens somewhere. Little did I realize that going to an only marginally great university would also make me a writer.\n\u201cThat is how you get to be a writer, incidentally: you feel somehow marginal, somehow slightly off-balance all the time. I spent an awful lot of time here buying gray flannel. I never could find the right shade.\n\u201cI finally gave up on gray flannel entirely, and went to the University of Chicago, the forty-eighth greatest university in the world.\n\u201cDo I know Thomas Pynchon?

said.\nLarkin said that the whole administration of the prison was in an uproar, because Virgil Greathouse, the former secretary of health, education, and welfare and one of the richest men in the country, had suddenly decided to begin serving his sentence immediately, without any further appeals, without any further delay. He was very probably the highest-ranking person any federal prison had ever been asked to contain.\nI knew Greathouse mainly by sight\u2014and of course by reputation. He was a famous tough guy, the founder and still majority stockholder in the public relations firm of Greathouse and Smiley, which specialized in putting the most favorable interpretations on the activities of Caribbean and Latin American dictatorships, of Bahamian gambling casinos, of Liberian and Panamanian tanker fleets, of several Central Intelligence Agency fronts around the world, of gangster-dominated unions such as the International Brotherhood of Abrasives and Adhesives Workers and the Amalgamated Fuel Handlers, of international conglomerates such as RAMJAC and Texas Fruit, and on and on.\nHe was bald. He was jowly. His forehead was wrinkled like a washboard. He had a cold pipe clamped in his teeth, even when he sat on a witness stand. I got close enough to him one time to discover that he made music on that pipe. It was like the twittering of birds. He entered Harvard six years after I graduated, so we never met there. We made eye-contact only once at the White House\u2014at the meeting where I made a fool of myself by lighting so many cigarettes. I was just a little mouse from the White House pantry, as far as he was concerned. He spoke to me only once, and that was after we were both arrested. We came together accidentally in a courthouse corridor, where we were facing separate arraignments. He found out who I was and evidently thought I might have something on him, which I did not. So he put his face close to mine, his eyes twinkling, his pipe in his teeth, and he made me this unforgettable promise: \u201cYou say anything about me, Buster, and when you get out of jail you\u2019ll be lucky to get a job cleaning toilets in a whorehouse in Port Said.\u201d\nIt was after he said that, that I heard the birdcalls from his pipe.\nGreathouse was a Quaker, by the way\u2014and so was Richard M. Nixon, of course. This was surely a special bond between them, one of the things that made them best of friends for a while.\nEmil Larkin was a Presbyterian.\nI myself was nothing. My father had been secretly baptized a Roman Catholic in Poland, a religion that was suppressed at the time. He grew up to be an agnostic. My mother was baptized a Greek Orthodox in Lithuania, but became a Roman Catholic in Cleveland. Father would never go to church with her. I myself was baptized a Roman Catholic, but aspired to my father\u2019s indifference, and quit going to church when I was twelve. When I applied for admission to Harvard, old Mr. McCone, a Baptist, told me to classify myself as a Congregationalist, which I did.\nMy son is an active Unitarian, I hear. His wife told me that she was a Methodist, but that she sang in an Episcopal Church every Sunday for pay.

He was a wealthy, extroverted, dull boy from a good family of engineers and managers in Minneapolis. He had squeaked through college, and was just barely acceptable to the personnel machines. Ordinarily, nobody would have hired him. But Kroner, who knew his bloodlines, had taken him on anyway and sent him to Ilium to be trained. The break had done anything but teach him humility. He took it as evidence that his money and name could beat the system any time and, paraphrased, he\u2019d said as much. The hell of it was that his attitude won grudging admiration from his fellow engineers, who had got their jobs the hard way. Paul supposed, gloomily, that beaters of systems had always been admired by the conventional. At any rate, Kroner still believed in the boy, so Paul had no choice but to keep him on, and to pair a smarter man with him to backstop his mental apparatus.\n\u201cWhat is this, Fred, a stickup?\u201d said Paul.", 0.028925736961451252], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["woman", 0.046511627906976744], ["pump", 0.03488372093023256], ["looked", 0.03488372093023256], ["love", 0.023255813953488372], ["product", 0.023255813953488372], ["strang", 0.023255813953488372], ["noise", 0.023255813953488372], ["water", 0.023255813953488372], ["screaming", 0.023255813953488372], ["book", 0.023255813953488372], ["elsie", 0.023255813953488372], ["morgan", 0.023255813953488372], ["making", 0.023255813953488372], ["husband", 0.023255813953488372], ["scream", 0.023255813953488372], ["lance", 0.011627906976744186], ["people", 0.011627906976744186], ["process", 0.011627906976744186], ["house", 0.011627906976744186], ["splashing", 0.011627906976744186], ["coming", 0.011627906976744186], ["hair", 0.011627906976744186], ["course", 0.011627906976744186], ["stroke", 0.011627906976744186], ["full", 0.011627906976744186], ["kinds", 0.011627906976744186], ["salesman", 0.011627906976744186], ["rolls", 0.011627906976744186], ["ground", 0.011627906976744186], ["blue", 0.011627906976744186], ["farouk", 0.011627906976744186], ["sue", 0.011627906976744186], ["quality", 0.011627906976744186], ["front", 0.011627906976744186], ["brushed", 0.011627906976744186], ["heroine", 0.011627906976744186], ["live", 0.011627906976744186], ["till", 0.011627906976744186], ["going", 0.011627906976744186], ["door", 0.011627906976744186], ["pays", 0.011627906976744186], ["magnum", 0.011627906976744186], ["spreading", 0.011627906976744186], ["surprised", 0.011627906976744186], ["body", 0.011627906976744186], ["eyes", 0.011627906976744186], ["handle", 0.011627906976744186], ["congratulations", 0.011627906976744186], ["met", 0.011627906976744186], ["wrong", 0.011627906976744186], ["putting", 0.011627906976744186], ["violent", 0.011627906976744186], ["hands", 0.011627906976744186], ["telling", 0.011627906976744186], ["celeste", 0.011627906976744186], ["sides", 0.011627906976744186], ["royce", 0.011627906976744186], ["king", 0.011627906976744186], ["sobbing", 0.011627906976744186], ["work", 0.011627906976744186], ["bucket", 0.011627906976744186], ["rusty", 0.011627906976744186], ["server", 0.011627906976744186], ["stopped", 0.011627906976744186], ["forgotten", 0.011627906976744186], ["selling", 0.011627906976744186], ["lady", 0.011627906976744186]], "sentiment": ["I ran to where the screaming was coming from, and I saw that an old rusty pump was making all the noise.\nBut it might as well have been a woman screaming, because a woman was making the pump scream, and the woman looked like she was just about to scream, too.

TV!\nHISCOCK\u2019S PARENTS, WHO were divorced and remarried but still friends, chipped in to have the bells mechanized, so that one person could play them by means of a keyboard. Before that, many people had to haul away on ropes, and once a bell was set swinging, it stopped swinging in its own sweet time. There was no way of damping it.\nIn the old days 4 of the bells were famously off-key, but beloved, and were known as \u201cPickle\u201d and \u201cLemon\u201d and \u201cBig Cracked John\u201d and \u201cBeelzebub.\u201d The Hiscocks had them sent to Belgium, to the same bell foundry where Andr\u00e9 Lutz had been an apprentice so long ago. There they were machined and weighted to perfect pitch, their condition when I got to play them.\nIt can\u2019t have been music the carillon made in the old days. Those who used to make whatever it was described it in their letters to The Musketeer with the same sort of batty love and berserk gratitude I hear from convicts when they tell me what it was like to take heroin laced with amphetamine, and angel dust laced with LSD, and crack alone, and on and on. I think of all those learning-disabled kids in the old days, hauling away on ropes with the bells clanging sweet and sour and as loud as thunder directly overhead, and I am sure they were finding the same undeserved happiness so many of the convicts found in chemicals.\nAnd haven\u2019t I myself said that the happiest parts of my life were when I played the bells? With absolutely no basis in reality, I felt like many an addict that I\u2019d won, I\u2019d won, I\u2019d won!\nWHEN I WAS made carillonneur, I taped this sign on the door of the chamber containing the keyboard: \u201cThor.\u201d That\u2019s who I felt like when I played, sending thunderbolts down the hillside and through the industrial ruins of Scipio, and out over the lake, and up to the walls of the prison on the other side.\nThere were echoes when I played\u2014bouncing off the empty factories and the prison walls, and arguing with notes just leaving the bells overhead. When Lake Mohiga was frozen, their argument was so loud that people who had never been in the area before thought the prison had its own set of bells, and that their carillonneur was mocking me.\nAnd I would yell into the mad clashing of bells and echoes, \u201cLaugh, Jack, laugh!\u201d\nAFTER THE PRISON break, the College President would shoot convicts down below from the belfry. The acoustics of the valley would cause the escapees to make many wrong guesses as to where the shots were coming from.\n8", 0.18182539682539675], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["estate", 0.03333333333333333], ["colonel", 0.03333333333333333], ["peckham", 0.03333333333333333], ["prospect", 0.016666666666666666], ["retired", 0.016666666666666666], ["advertisement", 0.016666666666666666], ["ten", 0.016666666666666666], ["brewer", 0.016666666666666666], ["agent", 0.016666666666666666], ["brain", 0.016666666666666666], ["indeedy", 0.016666666666666666], ["paper", 0.016666666666666666], ["ready", 0.016666666666666666], ["morning", 0.016666666666666666], ["hellbrunner", 0.016666666666666666], ["ad", 0.016666666666666666], ["guess", 0.016666666666666666], ["describing", 0.016666666666666666], ["torn", 0.016666666666666666], ["fingers", 0.016666666666666666], ["long", 0.016666666666666666], ["hot", 0.016666666666666666], ["interested", 0.016666666666666666], ["call", 0.016666666666666666], ["toledo", 0.016666666666666666], ["appeal", 0.016666666666666666], ["advice", 0.016666666666666666], ["red", 0.016666666666666666], ["real", 0.016666666666666666], ["life", 0.016666666666666666], ["attention", 0.016666666666666666], ["gaily", 0.016666666666666666], ["form", 0.016666666666666666], ["offer", 0.016666666666666666], ["brand", 0.016666666666666666], ["laughed", 0.016666666666666666], ["matters", 0.016666666666666666], ["toot", 0.016666666666666666], ["mansion", 0.016666666666666666], ["bit", 0.016666666666666666], ["couldn", 0.016666666666666666], ["box", 0.016666666666666666], ["reaction", 0.016666666666666666], ["noses", 0.016666666666666666], ["wife", 0.016666666666666666], ["fortified", 0.016666666666666666], ["work", 0.016666666666666666], ["walked", 0.016666666666666666], ["air", 0.016666666666666666], ["looked", 0.016666666666666666], ["lousy", 0.016666666666666666], ["substantial", 0.016666666666666666], ["boldface", 0.016666666666666666], ["joys", 0.016666666666666666], ["clean", 0.016666666666666666], ["castle", 0.016666666666666666], ["minutes", 0.016666666666666666]], "sentiment": ["\u201cCall me back when you\u2019ve got a reaction, and I\u2019ll toot out with an offer form all ready to go.\u201d\nTen minutes later he did. \u201cGuess what, brain-box?\u201d\n\u201cHe bit?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a brand-new real estate agent.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cYes indeedy.

It was about an Earthling astronaut who arrived on a planet where all the animal and plant life had been killed by pollution, except for humanoids. The humanoids ate food made from petroleum and coal.\nThey gave a feast for the astronaut, whose name was Don. The food was terrible. The big topic of conversation was censorship. The cities were blighted with motion picture theaters which showed nothing but dirty movies. The humanoids wished they could put them out of business somehow, but without interfering with free speech.\nThey asked Don if dirty movies were a problem on Earth, too, and Don said, \u201cYes.\u201d They asked him if the movies were really dirty, and Don replied, \u201cAs dirty as movies could get.\u201d\nThis was a challenge to the humanoids, who were sure their dirty movies could beat anything on Earth. So everybody piled into air-cushion vehicles, and they floated to a dirty movie house downtown.\nIt was intermission time when they got there, so Don had some time to think about what could possibly be dirtier than what he had already seen on Earth. He became sexually excited even before the house lights went down. The women in his party were all twittery and squirmy.\nSo the theater went dark and the curtains opened. At first there wasn\u2019t any picture. There were slurps and moans from loudspeakers. Then the picture itself appeared. It was a high quality film of a male humanoid eating what looked like a pear. The camera zoomed in on his lips and tongue and teeth, which glistened with saliva. He took his time about eating the pear. When the last of it had disappeared into his slurpy mouth, the camera focussed on his Adam\u2019s apple. His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed obscenely. He belched contentedly, and then these words appeared on the screen, but in the language of the planet:\nTHE END\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was all faked, of course. There weren\u2019t any pears anymore. And the eating of a pear wasn\u2019t the main event of the evening anyway. It was a short subject, which gave the members of the audience time to settle down.\nThen the main feature began. It was about a male and a female and their two children, and their dog and their cat. They ate steadily for an hour and a half\u2014soup, meat, biscuits, butter, vegetables, mashed potatoes and gravy, fruit, candy, cake, pie. The camera rarely strayed more than a foot from their glistening lips and their bobbing Adam\u2019s apples. And then the father put the cat and dog on the table, so they could take part in the orgy, too.", -0.0726349703935911], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["wasn", 0.06153846153846154], ["knowed", 0.06153846153846154], ["rifle", 0.046153846153846156], ["captain", 0.03076923076923077], ["mud", 0.03076923076923077], ["smile", 0.03076923076923077], ["crying", 0.03076923076923077], ["surprise", 0.03076923076923077], ["hurt", 0.03076923076923077], ["blowed", 0.03076923076923077], ["joke", 0.03076923076923077], ["set", 0.015384615384615385], ["extra", 0.015384615384615385], ["hanging", 0.015384615384615385], ["head", 0.015384615384615385], ["clumsy", 0.015384615384615385], ["eighteen", 0.015384615384615385], ["aimed", 0.015384615384615385], ["bore", 0.015384615384615385], ["poritsky", 0.015384615384615385], ["slow", 0.015384615384615385], ["tight", 0.015384615384615385], ["hot", 0.015384615384615385], ["dug", 0.015384615384615385], ["laid", 0.015384615384615385], ["swore", 0.015384615384615385], ["surprised", 0.015384615384615385], ["real", 0.015384615384615385], ["wouldn", 0.015384615384615385], ["eyes", 0.015384615384615385], ["kicked", 0.015384615384615385], ["big", 0.015384615384615385], ["felt", 0.015384615384615385], ["whistle", 0.015384615384615385], ["barrage", 0.015384615384615385], ["smiled", 0.015384615384615385], ["baby", 0.015384615384615385], ["sixteen", 0.015384615384615385], ["nineteen", 0.015384615384615385], ["died", 0.015384615384615385], ["couldn", 0.015384615384615385], ["bullet", 0.015384615384615385], ["growed", 0.015384615384615385], ["cry", 0.015384615384615385], ["air", 0.015384615384615385], ["soldier", 0.015384615384615385], ["stopped", 0.015384615384615385], ["skin", 0.015384615384615385], ["clogged", 0.015384615384615385]], "sentiment": ["And then he seen us.\nHe wasn\u2019t surprised to see us hanging there in air over him.
