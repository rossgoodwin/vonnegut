I still smoke a lot\u2014and have no clear idea why.\nSmokEnders worked for me, as I guess it works for everybody. The psychological consequences of my not smoking, however, were quite fancy\u2014unpleasant for those around me, though not for me, and my work stopped cold. I felt fine.\nI wrote the lady who founded the program\u2014in response to a letter from her. She wanted testimonials from famous people she had helped. I wanted more help, and thought she could offer some, since she probably knew more about smoking than anybody. She declined to reply, and I do not like her for that.\nI seem to be the victim of a truly profound addiction. I undergo radical personality changes when I stop. They are quite permanent and unattractive.
