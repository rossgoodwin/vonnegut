I\u2019ve written a play which some people [\u2026] think is screamingly funny, and which some people [\u2026] say stinks. My life (at 33 years of age) hangs by a thread. That damn play has just got to be produced. Yet, it looks like it won\u2019t be.\nMy sister is poverty-stricken, and I mean poverty stricken, at age 38, and she says she is damn well fed-up with the character-building aspects of disappointment. Me too.\nA power play is called for. I was all set to run a series of brilliantly brutal plays through Robert Alan Aurthur, when NBC benched him. How to mousetrap the $64,000 question?\nWhat next?\nYou intimated in your last letter that your job was getting on your nerves. You never talk about it, so I suppose it\u2019s none of my business. But, in a mood of friendly curiosity, let me ask, what\u2019s the big trouble with it?\nI read a couple of Maxim Gorky short stories last night, and both of them had as their theme that wicked peasants were forced to be wicked by social injustice. In one story, a mean, thieving, lying, greedy peasant actually makes this case in heaven before God and Jesus Christ, and brings tears to Their eyes!\nWell\u2014I would never tolerate such theories of irresponsibility in stories of mine, but I will suggest them in letters. Jesus, Knox\u2014isn\u2019t this a paltry generation? Depression, wars, atomic weapons, and the old buggers living forever, building bigger and bigger institutes for the painless gelding of the young.\nI get letters like this (I take my pen in hand, and\u2014) from a guy who has the Anchor Fence franchise in Key West. He wants to be a writer, too.\nAbout your not putting me up in your house, Knox: that\u2019s O.K. If you had asked of me, I would of refused. I don\u2019t have a very good time in New York when I stay in somebody\u2019s house, so I stay in hotels now.\nYours truly,", -0.030111210628452015], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf":

It is about a florist who tries to increase his business by convincing people who both work at home, or who spend long hours together running a Ma-and-Pa joint, that they are entitled to celebrate several wedding anniversaries a year.\nHe calculates that an average couple with separate places of work logs four man-woman hours each weekday, and sixteen of them on weekends. Being sound asleep with each other doesn\u2019t count. This gives him a standard man-woman week of thirty-six man-woman hours.\nHe multiplies that by fifty-two. This gives him, when rounded off, a standard man-woman year of eighteen hundred man-woman hours. He advertises that any couple that has accumulated this many man-woman hours is entitled to celebrate an anniversary, and to receive flowers and appropriate presents, even if it took them only twenty weeks to do it!\nIf couples keep piling up man-woman hours like that, as my wives and I have done in both my marriages, they can easily celebrate their Ruby Anniversary in only twenty years, and their Golden in twenty-five!\nI do not propose to discuss my love life. I will say that I still can\u2019t get over how women are shaped, and that I will go to my grave wanting to pet their butts and boobs. I will say, too, that lovemaking, if sincere, is one of the best ideas Satan put in the apple she gave to the serpent to give to Eve. The best idea in that apple, though, is making jazz.\n25\nAllie\u2019s husband Jim Adams really did go off an open drawbridge in a railroad train two days before Allie died in a hospital. Stranger than fiction!\nJim had plunged them deep in debt by manufacturing a toy of his own invention. It was a corked rubber balloon with a blob of permanently malleable clay inside. It was clay with a skin!\nThe face of a clown was printed on the balloon. You could make it open its mouth wide with your fingers, or make its nose protrude or its eyes sink in.

"sentiment": ["Dr. Robert Berman, DDS, did in fact attempt to relate to his biological son when the son was a sophomore at Knightsbridge High. He took him for a ride in what had been the boy\u2019s mother\u2019s convertible Mercedes, \u201cso they could talk.\u201d That\u2019s right! You got it! Dr. Berman was still driving what had become a priceless antique, not because he was cheap but because the car was glamorous. Gil Berman would say of that trip that he himself might as well have been the machine, and the Mercedes the fascinating personality, since his father talked to the car all the time. \u201cThe car had lost a lot of its pickup,\u201d said the comedian. \u201cSo when we were stopped at a stoplight with other cars around, Dr. Berman would say to the old Mercedes something like, \u2018Listen, old girl, in a moment that light is going to turn green, and nice people on important errands behind us will expect us as good citizens to jump ahead with all possible alacrity. Can you possibly do it this one last time? That\u2019s my baby.\u2019\u201d\nWhen in Barnstable High School on the Cape, Dr. Berman had had what almost none of his classmates had, unless they had some kind of business to inherit: a blueprint for a future he could surely build\u2014orthodontics. Others who played golf as well as he did, or could sing as well, might easily ruin their lives in sports or entertainment, where even more gifted people would surely cut them new assholes, would make them feel like something the cat drug in. That wasn\u2019t going to happen to young Bob Berman, and it didn\u2019t.\nGil Berman on his dad: \u201cHe was staunch! He held his course through all kinds of weather until he could at last drop anchor in the tranquil marina of orthodontics, where every patient has deep pockets, and no one dies.\u201d There in the Calvin Theater on December 11, 2000, Gil Berman might have been his father when his father was a teenager: \u201cLet us pray: Our Father, which art in Heaven: Lead us not into the temptation of outsize expectations.\u201d\nMagda Lanz Berman, Gil Berman\u2019s mother, died of cancer on April 9, 2000, having been a widow for twenty-three years. She had been a wife for only about half that long. She had been smoking two packs of unfiltered Pall Mall cigarettes since she was twenty, but she didn\u2019t die of cancer of the lung. She died of the quickie: pancreas. She died three months before her son the comedian entered the Caldwell Institute for the second time. That\u2019s right! You got it! Gil Berman had committed himself to Caldwell once before.\nHe committed himself the first time \u201cwhen,\u201d in his own words, \u201cI was a preemie, a neonate.\u201d He was also a newlywed, twenty-four years old. While in Las Vegas, Nevada, for the first time in his life, as a warm-up act for Marie Osmond, he had married a topless dancer named \u201cWanda Lightfoot,\u201d if you can believe it, when they were both tiddley-poo on LSD. During the wedding ceremony, during which they had promised to have and to hold and so on, he at least had the presence of mind to whisper hoarsely to his bride, who had a terrific set of knockers, \u201cNo kids, no kids.\u201d\nBerman: \u201cThe next thing I knew, the knockers and I were somehow in a suite at the Ritz Carlton in Boston, one of my dad\u2019s old stomping grounds with babes. Monkey see, monkey do. The knockers, who was chain-smoking weed, may have asked to meet my mother out in Knightsbridge. That seems possible. I mean, what the hell? I had by then sworn off LSD and was limiting my intake to a crystal-clear detox medicine called \u2018Absolut.\u2019\n\u201cSo she said she was pregnant, and was so happy because she had always wanted a little baby to cuddle and nurse and so on. \u2018No abortion.\u2019 If she said \u2018No abortion,\u2019 it stands to reason that at some point in time I might have recommended that identical surgical procedure. Sometimes time flies, sometimes it creeps. On that particular occasion, time chose to fly, and the next thing I knew I was in a jail cell, just like the ones in the movies, and they told me my wife was in Massachusetts General Hospital with several teeth missing and a broken jaw, but that the baby inside her was still O.K. In my baroque experience, it is only in jokes that there\u2019s both good news and bad news: \u2018There\u2019s good news and there\u2019s bad news. The bad news is such-and-such, but the good news is such-and-such.\u201d\nNone of the above has been part of a public performance. It is a transcript of Berman\u2019s recorded admissions interview sixteen years ago, again: the first time he committed himself to Caldwell. Had he and his psychiatric social worker wished to fill in gaps in the tale, they had only to read accounts in the Boston Globe.

So it goes.\nProperly enrolled and tagged, the Americans were led through gate after gate again. In two days\u2019 time now their families would learn from the International Red Cross that they were alive.\nNext to Billy was little Paul Lazzaro, who had promised to avenge Roland Weary. Lazzaro wasn\u2019t thinking about vengeance. He was thinking about his terrible bellyache. His stomach had shrunk to the size of a walnut. That dry, shriveled pouch was as sore as a boil.\nNext to Lazzaro was poor, doomed old Edgar Derby, with his American and German dogs displayed like a necklace, on the outside of his clothes. He had expected to become a captain, a company commander, because of his wisdom and age. Now here he was on the Czechoslovakian border at midnight.\n\u201cHalt,\u201d said a guard.\nThe Americans halted. They stood there quietly in the cold. The sheds they were among were outwardly like thousands of other sheds they had passed. There was this difference, though: the sheds had tin chimneys, and out of the chimneys whirled constellations of sparks.\nA guard knocked on a door.\nThe door was flung open from inside. Light leaped out through the door, escaped from prison at 186,000 miles per second. Out marched fifty middle-aged Englishmen. They were singing \u201cHail, Hail, the Gang\u2019s All Here\u201d from the Pirates of Penzance.\nThese lusty, ruddy vocalists were among the first English-speaking prisoners to be taken in the Second World War. Now they were singing to nearly the last. They had not seen a woman or a child for four years or more. They hadn\u2019t seen any birds, either. Not even sparrows would come into the camp.\nThe Englishmen were officers. Each of them had attempted to escape from another prison at least once.

Fern is the name,\" he said.\n\"I had a professor in the Harvard Business School,\" said young Fern to Noel Constant, \"who kept telling me that I was smart, but that I would have to find my boy, if I was going to be rich. He wouldn\u2019t explain what he meant. He said I would catch on sooner or later. I asked him how I could go looking for my boy, and he suggested that I work for the Bureau of Internal Revenue for a year or so.\n\"When I went over your tax returns, Mr. Constant, it suddenly came to me what it was he meant. He meant I was shrewd and thorough, but I wasn\u2019t remarkably lucky. I had to find somebody who had luck in an astonishing degree\u2014and so I have.\"\n\"Why should I pay you two thousand dollars a week?\" said Noel Constant. \"You see my facilities and my staff here, and you know what I\u2019ve done with them.\"\n\"Yes\u2014\" said Fern, \"and I can show you where you should have made two hundred million where you made only fifty-nine. You know absolutely nothing about corporate law or tax law\u2014or even common-sense business procedure.\"\nFern thereupon proved this to Noel Constant, father of Malachi \u2014 and Fern showed him an organizational plan that had the name Magnum Opus, Incorporated. It was a marvelous engine for doing violence to the spirit of thousands of laws without actually running afoul of so much as a city ordinance.\nNoel Constant was so impressed by this monument to hypocrisy and sharp practice that he wanted to buy stock in it without even referring to his Bible.\n\"Mr. Constant, sir,\" said young Fern, \"don\u2019t you understand? Magnum Opus is you, with you as chairman of the board, with me as president.\n\"Mr. Constant,\" he said, \"right now you\u2019re as easy for the Bureau of Internal Revenue to watch as a man on a street corner selling apples and pears. But just imagine how hard you would be to watch if you had a whole office building jammed to the rafters with industrial bureaucrats\u2014men who lose things and use the wrong forms and create new forms and demand everything in quintuplicate, and who understand perhaps a third of what is said to them; who habitually give misleading answers in order to gain time in which to think, who make decisions only when forced to, and who then cover their tracks; who make perfectly honest mistakes in addition and subtraction, who call meetings whenever they feel lonely, who write memos whenever they feel unloved; men who never throw anything away unless they think it could get them fired. A single industrial bureaucrat, if he is sufficiently vital and nervous, should be able to create a ton of meaningless papers a year for the Bureau of Internal Revenue to examine. In the Magnum Opus Building, we will have thousands of them! And you and I can have the top two stories, and you can go on keeping track of what\u2019s really going on the way you do now.\" He looked around the room. \"How do you keep track now, by the way\u2014 writing with a burnt match on the margins of a telephone directory?\"", 0.11065076228119711], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["dance", 0.026785714285714284],

much in person, has not changed one iota in a million years. Neither have these birds learned to be afraid of anything. Neither have they shown the slightest inclination to give up on aviation and become submarines.\nAs for the meaning of the courtship dance of the blue-footed boobies: The birds are huge molecules with bright blue feet and have no choice in the matter. By their very nature, they have to dance exactly like that.\nHuman beings used to be molecules which could do many, many different sorts of dances, or decline to dance at all\u2014as they pleased. My mother could do the waltz, the tango, the rumba, the Charleston, the Lindy hop, the jitterbug, the Watusi, and the twist. Father refused to do any dances, as was his privilege.\n21\nWHEN MRS. ONASSIS said she wanted to go on \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century,\u201d then everybody wanted to go, and Roy and Mary Hepburn were almost entirely forgotten, with their pitiful little cabin below the waterline. By the end of March, King was able to release a passenger list headed by Mrs. Onassis, and followed by names almost as glamorous as hers\u2014Dr. Henry Kissinger, Mick Jagger, Paloma Picasso, William F. Buckley, Jr., and of course *Andrew MacIntosh, and Rudolf Nureyev and Walter Cronkite, and on and on. *Zenji Hiroguchi, traveling under the name Zenji Kenzaburo, was said in the release to be a world famous expert in animal diseases, so as to make him seem more or less in scale with all the other passengers.\nTwo names were left off the list as a matter of delicacy, so as not to raise the embarrassing question of who they were, exactly, since they were really nobody at all. They were Roy and Mary Hepburn, with their pitiful little cabin below the waterline.\nBut then this slightly bobtailed list became the official list. So when Ecuatoriana Airlines in May sent a telegram to everybody on the list, notifying them that there would be a special overnight flight for any of them who happened to be in New York City on the evening before the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was to sail, Mary Hepburn was not among those notified. Limousines would pick them up anywhere in the city, and take them to the airport. Each seat on the plane could be converted into a bed, and the tourist seats had been replaced with cabaret tables and a dance floor, where a company from the Ecuadorian Ballet Folkl\u00f3rico would perform characteristic dances of various Indian tribes, including the fire dance of the elusive Kanka-bonos. Gourmet meals would be served, along with wines worthy of the greatest restaurants in France. All this would be free of charge, but Roy and Mary Hepburn never heard about it.\nYes, and they never got a letter that everybody else got in June\u2014from Dr. Jos\u00e9 Sep\u00falveda de la Madrid, the president of Ecuador, inviting them to a state breakfast in their honor at the Hotel El Dorado, followed by a parade in which they would ride in horse-drawn carriages decked with flowers\u2014from the hotel to the waterfront, where they would board the ship.", 0.1720254492981766], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["gregory", 0.024291497975708502], ["dan", 0.016194331983805668],

up to one end of the holy of holies, the studio. It looked dark up there. I was to climb the stairs alone. It was easy to believe that there was a gallows tree dangling a noose over a trap door up there.\nSo up I went. I stopped at the head of the stairs, and perceived an impossibility: six free-standing chimneys and fireplaces, with a coal fire glowing in the hearth of every one.\nLet me explain architecturally what was really going on. Gregory, you see, had bought three typical New York brownstones, each one three windows wide, four floors high, and fifty feet deep, with two fireplaces on each floor. I had supposed that he owned only the townhouse with the oak door and the Gorgon knocker infected with verdigris. So I was unprepared for the vista on the top floor, which seemed to violate all laws of time and space by going on and on and on. Down on the lower floors, including the basement, he had joined up to three houses with doors and archways. On the top floor, though, he had ripped out the dividing walls entirely, from end to end and side to side, leaving only those six free-standing fireplaces.\nThe only illumination that first night came from the six coal fires, and from pale zebra stripes on the ceiling. The stripes were light from a streetlamp below\u2014cut to ribbons by nine windows overlooking East Forty-eighth Street.\nWhere was Dan Gregory? I could not see him at first. He was motionless and silent\u2014and shapeless in a voluminous black caftan, displaying his back to me, and low, hunched over on a camel saddle before a fireplace in the middle, about twenty feet from me. I identified the objects on the mantelpiece above him before I understood where he was. They were the whitest things in the grotto. They were eight human skulls, an octave arranged in order of size, with a child\u2019s at one end and a great-grandfather\u2019s at the other\u2014a marimba for cannibals.\nThere was a kind of music up there, a tedious fugue for pots and pans deployed under a leaking skylight to the right of Gregory. The skylight was under a blanket of melting snow.\n\u201cKer-plunk.\u201d Silence. \u201cPlink-pank.\u201d Silence. \u201cPloop.\u201d Silence. That was how the song of the skylight went as my gaze probed Dan Gregory\u2019s one indubitable masterpiece, that studio\u2014his one work of breathtaking originality.\nA simple inventory of the weapons and tools and idols and icons and hats and helmets and ship models and airplane models and stuffed animals, including a crocodile and an upright polar bear, in the masterpiece would be amazing enough. But think of this: there were fifty-two mirrors of every conceivable period and shape, many of them hung in unexpected places at crazy angles, to multiply even the bewildered observer to infinity. There at the top of the stairs, with Dan Gregory invisible to me, I myself was everywhere!\nI know there were fifty-two mirrors because I counted them the next day. Some I was supposed to polish every week. Others I was not to dust on penalty of death, according to my master. Nobody could counterfeit images in dusty mirrors like Dan Gregory.\nNow he spoke, and rolled his shoulders some, so I could see where he was. And he said this: \u201cI was never welcome anywhere either.\u201d He was using his British accent again, which was the only one he ever used, except in fun. He went on: \u201cIt was very good for me to be so unwelcome, so unappreciated by my own master, because look what I have become.\u201d", 0.10535986689047913], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["interviewer", 0.032679738562091505], ["vonnegut", 0.032679738562091505], ["dreams", 0.026143790849673203], ["school", 0.026143790849673203], ["true", 0.026143790849673203], ["high", 0.026143790849673203], ["mother", 0.026143790849673203], ["writing", 0.0196078431372549], ["lived", 0.0196078431372549], ["years", 0.013071895424836602], ["father", 0.013071895424836602], ["sons", 0.013071895424836602], ["cape", 0.013071895424836602], ["impossible", 0.013071895424836602], ["wanted", 0.013071895424836602], ["cod", 0.013071895424836602], ["impossibly", 0.013071895424836602], ["vulgarity", 0.013071895424836602], ["top", 0.013071895424836602], ["live", 0.013071895424836602], ["sister", 0.013071895424836602], ["work", 0.013071895424836602], ["son", 0.006535947712418301], ["german", 0.006535947712418301], ["money", 0.006535947712418301], ["attitude", 0.006535947712418301], ["paper", 0.006535947712418301], ["oldest", 0.006535947712418301], ["electricity", 0.006535947712418301], ["writer", 0.006535947712418301], ["easy", 0.006535947712418301], ["farmer", 0.006535947712418301], ["east", 0.006535947712418301], ["friendly", 0.006535947712418301], ["coffee", 0.006535947712418301], ["good", 0.006535947712418301], ["watch", 0.006535947712418301], ["report", 0.006535947712418301], ["traveled", 0.006535947712418301], ["crass", 0.006535947712418301], ["mothers", 0.006535947712418301], ["common", 0.006535947712418301], ["finishing", 0.006535947712418301], ["jamaica", 0.006535947712418301], ["set", 0.006535947712418301], ["ten", 0.006535947712418301], ["people", 0.006535947712418301], ["house", 0.006535947712418301], ["wasn", 0.006535947712418301], ["fist", 0.006535947712418301], ["saturday", 0.006535947712418301], ["depression", 0.006535947712418301], ["pictures", 0.006535947712418301], ["slick", 0.006535947712418301], ["congenial", 0.006535947712418301], ["falling", 0.006535947712418301], ["europe", 0.006535947712418301], ["attended", 0.006535947712418301], ["journal", 0.006535947712418301], ["french", 0.006535947712418301], ["studio", 0.006535947712418301], ["post", 0.006535947712418301], ["great", 0.006535947712418301], ["talent", 0.006535947712418301], ["studied", 0.006535947712418301], ["practical", 0.006535947712418301], ["magazine", 0.006535947712418301], ["ladies", 0.006535947712418301], ["jim", 0.006535947712418301], ["family", 0.006535947712418301], ["spooky", 0.006535947712418301], ["highly", 0.006535947712418301], ["plusses", 0.006535947712418301], ["magazines", 0.006535947712418301], ["cultivated", 0.006535947712418301], ["loaded", 0.006535947712418301], ["strangely", 0.006535947712418301], ["story", 0.006535947712418301], ["log", 0.006535947712418301], ["adopted", 0.006535947712418301], ["cosmopolitan", 0.006535947712418301], ["grandchildren", 0.006535947712418301], ["painted", 0.006535947712418301], ["grew", 0.006535947712418301], ["animals", 0.006535947712418301], ["isolation", 0.006535947712418301], ["evening", 0.006535947712418301], ["cards", 0.006535947712418301], ["making", 0.006535947712418301], ["turned", 0.006535947712418301], ["telephone", 0.006535947712418301], ["woman", 0.006535947712418301], ["collier", 0.006535947712418301], ["mediocre", 0.006535947712418301], ["robinson", 0.006535947712418301], ["mountain", 0.006535947712418301], ["floor", 0.006535947712418301], ["fortunately", 0.006535947712418301], ["member", 0.006535947712418301], ["writers", 0.006535947712418301], ["intelligent", 0.006535947712418301], ["goat", 0.006535947712418301], ["shortridge", 0.006535947712418301], ["indianapolis", 0.006535947712418301], ["architects", 0.006535947712418301], ["hand", 0.006535947712418301], ["died", 0.006535947712418301], ["short", 0.006535947712418301], ["required", 0.006535947712418301], ["daily", 0.006535947712418301], ["fluent", 0.006535947712418301], ["swiss", 0.006535947712418301], ["dream", 0.006535947712418301]], "sentiment": ["VONNEGUT: Coffee.\nINTERVIEWER: So your mother studied short story writing?\nVONNEGUT: And my father painted pictures in a studio he\u2019d set up on the top floor of the house. There wasn\u2019t much work for architects during the Great Depression\u2014not much work for anybody. Strangely enough, though, Mother was right: Even mediocre magazine writers were making money hand over fist.\nINTERVIEWER: So your mother took a very practical attitude toward writing.\nVONNEGUT: Not to say crass. She was a highly intelligent, cultivated woman, by the way. She went to the same high school I did, and was one of the few people who got nothing but A-plusses while she was there. She went east to a finishing school after that, and then traveled all over Europe. She was fluent in German and French. I still have her high school report cards somewhere. \u201cA-plus, A-plus, A-plus \u2026\u201d She was a good writer, it turned out, but she had no talent for the vulgarity the slick magazines required. Fortunately, I was loaded with vulgarity, so, when I grew up, I was able to make her dream come true. Writing for Collier\u2019s and The Saturday Evening Post and Cosmopolitan and Ladies\u2019 Home Journal and so on was as easy as falling off a log for me. I only wish she\u2019d lived to see it. I only wish she\u2019d lived to see all her grandchildren. She has ten. She didn\u2019t even get to see the first one. I made another one of her dreams come true: I lived on Cape Cod for many years. She always wanted to live on Cape Cod. It\u2019s probably very common for sons to try to make their mothers\u2019 impossible dreams come true. I adopted my sister\u2019s sons after she died, and it\u2019s spooky to watch them try to make her impossible dreams come true.\nINTERVIEWER: What were your sister\u2019s dreams like?\nVONNEGUT: She wanted to live like a member of The Swiss Family Robinson, with impossibly friendly animals in impossibly congenial isolation.

that our telephone did not ring\u2014that, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that my job required me to be available at all hours of the night or day, she would rather not have a telephone in the house. As for conversations with supposedly well-informed people long into the night, she said she hated to stay up past ten o\u2019clock, and that in the concentration camp she had heard enough supposedly inside information to last her for the rest of her days, and then some. \u201cI am not one of those people, Walter,\u201d she said, \u201cwho finds it necessary to always know, supposedly, what is really going on.\u201d\nIt may be that Ruth protected herself from dread of the gathering storm, or, more accurately, from dread of the gathering silence, by reverting during the daytime, when I was at work, to the Ophelia-like elation she had felt after her liberation\u2014when she had thought of herself as a bird all alone with God. She did not neglect the boy, who was five when Leland Clewes went to prison. He was always clean and well-fed. She did not take to secret drinking. She did, however, start to eat a lot.\nAnd this brings me to the subject of body sizes again, something I am very reluctant to discuss\u2014because I don\u2019t want to give them more importance than they deserve. Body sizes can be remarkable for their variations from accepted norms, but still explain almost nothing about the lives led inside those bodies. I am small enough to have been a coxswain, as I have already confessed. That explains nothing. And, by the time Leland Clewes came to trial for perjury, my wife, although only five feet tall, weighed one hundred and sixty pounds or so.\nSo be it.\nExcept for this: Our son very early on concluded that his notorious little father and his fat, foreign mother were such social handicaps to him that he actually told several playmates in the neighborhood that he was an adopted child. A neighbor woman invited my wife over for coffee during the daytime exactly once, and with this purpose: to discover if we knew who the boy\u2019s real parents were.\nPeace.\nSo a decent interval went by after Leland Clewes was sent to prison, two years, as I say\u2014and then I was called into the office of Assistant Secretary of the Army Shelton Walker. We had never met. He had never been in government service before. He was my age. He had been in the war and had risen to the rank of major in the Field Artillery and had made the landings in North Africa and then, on D-Day, in France. But he was essentially an Oklahoma businessman. Someone would tell me later that he owned the largest tire distributorship in the state. More startling to me: He was a Republican, for General of the Armies Dwight David Eisenhower had now become President\u2014the first Republican to hold that office in twenty years.\nMr. Walker wished to express, he said, the gratitude that the whole country should feel for my years of faithful service in both war and peace. He said that I had executive skills that would surely have been more lavishly rewarded if I had employed them in private industry. An economy drive was underway, he said, and the post I held was to be terminated. Many other posts were being terminated, so that he was unable to move me somewhere else, as much as he might have liked to do so. I was fired, in short. I am unable to say even now whether he was being unkind or not when he said to me, rising and extending his hand, \u201cYou can now sell your considerable skills, Mr. Starbuck, for their true value in the open marketplace of the Free Enterprise System. Happy hunting! Good luck!\u201d\nWhat did I know about Free Enterprise? I know a great deal about it now, but I knew nothing about it then. I knew so little about it then that I was able to imagine for several months that private industry really would pay a lot for an all-purpose executive like me. I told my poor wife during those first months of unemployment that, yes, that was certainly an option we held, in case all else failed: that I could at any time raise my arms like a man crucified, so to speak, and fall backward into General Motors or General Electric or some such thing. A measure of the kindness of this woman to me: She never asked me why I didn\u2019t do that immediately if it was so easy\u2014never asked me to explain why, exactly, I felt that there was something silly and not quite gentlemanly about private industry.\n\u201cWe may have to be rich, even though we don\u2019t want to be,\u201d I remember telling her somewhere in there. My son was six by then, and listening\u2014and old enough, surely, to ponder such a paradox. Could it have made any sense to him?

Earl, this house is science fiction.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Earl. The flattery was beginning, building up to something\u2014a big touch, probably. Earl was determined not to be spellbound by Charley\u2019s smooth ways. \u201cAbout par for the course in America, maybe, for somebody who isn\u2019t afraid of hard work.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a course\u2014with this for par, eh?\u201d\nEarl looked closely at his guest, trying to discover if Charley was belittling him again. \u201cIf I seemed to brag a little when those fool magazine people were here,\u201d he said, \u201cI think maybe I\u2019ve got a little something to brag about. This house is a lot more\u2019n a house. It\u2019s the story of my life, Charley\u2014my own personal pyramid, sort of.\u201d\nCharley lifted his glass in a toast. \u201cMay it last as long as the Great Pyramid at Gizeh.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Earl. It was high time, he decided, that Charley be put on the defensive. \u201cYou a doctor, Charley?\u201d", 0.0687037037037037], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["familiar", 0.05172413793103448], ["dwayne", 0.040229885057471264], ["flat", 0.034482758620689655], ["sugar", 0.028735632183908046], ["creek", 0.028735632183908046], ["three", 0.017241379310344827], ["badges", 0.011494252873563218], ["interstate", 0.011494252873563218], ["bound", 0.011494252873563218], ["national", 0.011494252873563218], ["state", 0.011494252873563218], ["barrier", 0.011494252873563218], ["water", 0.011494252873563218], ["city", 0.011494252873563218], ["arts", 0.011494252873563218], ["lanes", 0.011494252873563218], ["park", 0.011494252873563218], ["steel", 0.011494252873563218], ["surface", 0.011494252873563218], ["bend", 0.011494252873563218], ["memorial", 0.011494252873563218], ["relatives", 0.011494252873563218], ["knew", 0.011494252873563218], ["essay", 0.005747126436781609], ["felt", 0.005747126436781609], ["fifty", 0.005747126436781609], ["treeless", 0.005747126436781609], ["argued", 0.005747126436781609], ["imagined", 0.005747126436781609], ["bunch", 0.005747126436781609], ["toast", 0.005747126436781609], ["busy", 0.005747126436781609], ["young", 0.005747126436781609], ["terminal", 0.005747126436781609], ["sequestered", 0.005747126436781609], ["east", 0.005747126436781609], ["wearing", 0.005747126436781609], ["town", 0.005747126436781609], ["woman", 0.005747126436781609], ["ukwende", 0.005747126436781609], ["prevented", 0.005747126436781609], ["jism", 0.005747126436781609], ["sunny", 0.005747126436781609], ["recollection", 0.005747126436781609], ["trough", 0.005747126436781609], ["township", 0.005747126436781609], ["county", 0.005747126436781609], ["trucks", 0.005747126436781609], ["boost", 0.005747126436781609], ["median", 0.005747126436781609], ["miles", 0.005747126436781609], ["silently", 0.005747126436781609], ["people", 0.005747126436781609], ["parking", 0.005747126436781609], ["favor", 0.005747126436781609], ["unpinned", 0.005747126436781609], ["resilient", 0.005747126436781609], ["badge", 0.005747126436781609], ["highway", 0.005747126436781609], ["full", 0.005747126436781609], ["wheat", 0.005747126436781609], ["creating", 0.005747126436781609], ["cars", 0.005747126436781609], ["hundreds", 0.005747126436781609], ["oceans", 0.005747126436781609], ["yards", 0.005747126436781609], ["boy", 0.005747126436781609], ["times", 0.005747126436781609], ["airport", 0.005747126436781609], ["barry", 0.005747126436781609], ["gazed", 0.005747126436781609], ["grade", 0.005747126436781609], ["number", 0.005747126436781609], ["indaro", 0.005747126436781609], ["feet", 0.005747126436781609], ["nostalgia", 0.005747126436781609], ["midland", 0.005747126436781609], ["festival", 0.005747126436781609], ["west", 0.005747126436781609], ["pinned", 0.005747126436781609], ["needed", 0.005747126436781609], ["lot", 0.005747126436781609], ["moat", 0.005747126436781609], ["mountains", 0.005747126436781609], ["lived", 0.005747126436781609], ["inches", 0.005747126436781609], ["deep", 0.005747126436781609], ["women", 0.005747126436781609], ["wide", 0.005747126436781609], ["fairchild", 0.005747126436781609], ["places", 0.005747126436781609], ["will", 0.005747126436781609], ["supposed", 0.005747126436781609], ["lover", 0.005747126436781609], ["stages", 0.005747126436781609], ["engineers", 0.005747126436781609], ["beautiful", 0.005747126436781609], ["ordered", 0.005747126436781609], ["grassy", 0.005747126436781609], ["fuck", 0.005747126436781609], ["lust", 0.005747126436781609], ["inn", 0.005747126436781609], ["evening", 0.005747126436781609], ["breakfast", 0.005747126436781609], ["impassive", 0.005747126436781609], ["built", 0.005747126436781609], ["scrawled", 0.005747126436781609], ["nuts", 0.005747126436781609], ["forests", 0.005747126436781609], ["parks", 0.005747126436781609], ["tumbling", 0.005747126436781609], ["fiddled", 0.005747126436781609], ["ached", 0.005747126436781609], ["divider", 0.005747126436781609], ["week", 0.005747126436781609], ["lapel", 0.005747126436781609], ["hoover", 0.005747126436781609], ["moment", 0.005747126436781609], ["man", 0.005747126436781609], ["center", 0.005747126436781609], ["third", 0.005747126436781609], ["mask", 0.005747126436781609], ["face", 0.005747126436781609], ["thought", 0.005747126436781609], ["concrete", 0.005747126436781609], ["time", 0.005747126436781609], ["farmlands", 0.005747126436781609], ["mildred", 0.005747126436781609]], "sentiment": ["He needed a woman, too, or a bunch of women who would fuck him hundreds of times a week, because he was so full of lust and jism all the time.

Behind his mask was a young man in the terminal stages of nostalgia and lover\u2019s nuts.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDwayne Hoover, six feet away, gazed out at the busy, sunny Interstate Highway. He knew where he was. There was a familiar moat between the parking lot of the Inn and the Interstate, a concrete trough which the engineers had built to contain Sugar Creek. Next came a familiar resilient steel barrier which prevented cars and trucks from tumbling into Sugar Creek. Next came the three familiar west-bound lanes, and then the familiar grassy median divider. After that came the three familiar east-bound lanes, and then another familiar steel barrier. After that came the familiar Will Fairchild Memorial Airport\u2014and then the familiar farmlands beyond.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was certainly flat out there\u2014flat city, flat township, flat county, flat state. When Dwayne was a little boy, he had supposed that almost everybody lived in places that were treeless and flat. He imagined that oceans and mountains and forests were mainly sequestered in state and national parks. In the third grade, little Dwayne scrawled an essay which argued in favor of creating a national park at a bend in Sugar Creek, the only significant surface water within eight miles of Midland City.\nDwayne said the name of that familiar surface water to himself now, silently: \u201cSugar Creek.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSugar Creek was only two inches deep and fifty yards wide at the bend, where little Dwayne thought the park should be. Now they had put the Mildred Barry Memorial Center for the Arts there instead. It was beautiful.\nDwayne fiddled with his lapel for a moment, felt a badge pinned there. He unpinned it, having no recollection of what it said. It was a boost for the Arts Festival, which would begin that evening. All over town people were wearing badges like Dwayne\u2019s.
