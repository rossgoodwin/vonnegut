He snapped at me a lot. So much so that I left him a note at the Hotel Northampton, along with keys to an apartment within walking distance from the hotel, saying that I was at his disposal, but only if and when he asked. He took the keys when no one was looking and climbed the steep staircase to the waiting apartment, where he hung the very few pieces of clothing he had. His new home came with a computer to write on and a charming and witty landlady who gradually brought out the courtly Kurt Vonnegut; I saw a little color come back to his cheeks.\nHe could walk to Serio\u2019s, our local grocery store, where they even carried Pall Malls. The Tunnel Bar was practically in his backyard, a place so darkened he would not be recognized, and a place where he could smoke and drink. He made friends with all the clerks at the local hardware store, probably because, as a boy in Indianapolis, he had worked at Vonnegut Hardware. The first thing he bought for his new life was a Waring blender. He could walk to my house for dinner if he felt like it. Sometimes he would come by with shopping bags full of candy and soda for his grandchildren, commanding them to \u201cLive it up!\u201d\nI brought my father to a performance of Hal Holbrook\u2019s Mark Twain at The Calvin Theater not long after he arrived. My father was transfixed. He communicated his agreement with Mr. Twain\u2019s words with quiet coughs and sighs. Toward the end of the performance, Mark Twain said something about having deeply disappointed his wife. This elicited from my father a deep groan. We stayed behind to meet Hal Holbrook. I watched as the two Mark Twains spoke to each other with utmost respect, almost reverence.\nAnother good day was when I watched my dad goose Gloria Steinem on the steps of the Smith College Chapel, where she was about to deliver a sermon to Smithies. Gloria Steinem turned around, completely composed, and said, \u201cOh, hello Kurt.\u201d\nMy father and I did a lot of walking when he was in Northampton. The talks were always intense, but they were often broken up by his sudden theatrics, such as when he saw a squirrel freeze in the street with a nut in his mouth, and shouted, \u201cHey, you, squirrel, drop that nut!\u201d We\u2019d double over laughing for an unnatural amount of time and then return to the very serious subject at hand. He was trying to figure out how to resolve his marital problems. He was considering faking his own death as a possible solution.\nThough it had been more than thirty years since I had had any extended amount of time with my father, not much had changed. I still worried that he would not answer the door and I might find him dead. Growing up, suicide was always considered a possible and even logical outcome of my father\u2019s life. But my father always answered the door, and I usually found him in the act of writing, which included working on the New York Times crossword puzzle. Sitting next to him on his purple velvet futon couch, I\u2019d listen to what he was trying to write. As he talked, his long toes would knead the floor, and I could feel heat waves coming off his head as he was working an idea. He appeared to me then as an exquisite alien creature, as if his giant brain and long toes were trying to extract something from another planet. He told me he was failing to connect with anything worthwhile that day, except his main character, Gil Berman, who might have to fake his own death.\nMost times I\u2019d find my father in a very receptive mood to my prying questions, like \u201cHow many times have you been in love?\u201d His answer was instantaneous, and he held up three long fingers. I was relieved to hear my mother was one of them. His explanation of the merits and failures of each true love struck me as completely fair. Whether or not my mother really did not love him enough did not matter; he felt that love was lacking, and I believed him. As I was walking out the door with his laundry, I suggested that we go to therapy together. He answered, \u201cThere\u2019s too much to talk about!\u201d There was nothing unloving in this answer; he was absolutely right. Sometimes the best thing for me was to tell a good joke and tell it well. When I told him about the old man who confessed to a youth with a colorful Mohawk haircut that he had fucked a parrot many years before, and was wondering if the young man might be his son, my father told me that my delivery was elegant.\nOnce, I brought to my father\u2019s attention a story in the Boston Globe about a stockbroker who had killed his wife and staked her head to a pole in the front yard for the entire neighborhood to see. The husband explained that he had gone bonkers when the wife overcooked the pasta for supper.

She looked at the picture that was absorbing most of his attention.\n\u201cThe glass on it got cracked somehow,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I could go into town and get another one. Do you suppose that would be possible?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to ask the General about that, too. He says you\u2019re going to be a pretty busy boy around here, and I imagine he\u2019ll want you to stick close to the farm for a while, anyway. Sometimes,\u201d she said bitterly, \u201cthe girls walk into town and leave me to make the beds and wash the dishes, and straighten up the house all by myself \u2014 like today. I suppose they could get you another glass, if you asked them, if they could leave off chasing boys long enough to do it.\u201d She studied the photograph. \u201cThose your folks?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my mother and father,\u201d said Haley gravely. \u201cThis was taken when they were very young, of course. You can tell that by the way Mother\u2019s got her hair fixed. They somehow never had many pictures taken of themselves together. This is about the only one.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re both very nice looking,\u201d said Annie. She squinted so as to see the picture more sharply. \u201cYou\u2019d never know that the General and your mother were brother and sister, except for maybe the lines around her eyes.\u201d She paused, and something like warmth came into her eyes for the first time since Haley had seen them. \u201cGolly,\u201d she said, \u201cI can imagine what you\u2019ve been through. We lost our mother while the war was going on, you know, and I had to kind of try and take over. Believe me, I know how you feel, Haley.\u201d\nHaley did not want to talk or think about it. He turned his back on her, and busied himself with straightening the contents of his sock drawer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny about relatives, isn\u2019t it?\u201d mused Annie. \u201cHere you are my first cousin, even if it is by adoption, and I never laid eyes on you before today, and the General\u2019s never seen you. I just wonder where Kitty and Hope and I\u2019ll be twenty years from today.\u201d She made clucking noises, and shook her head slowly.\nThe sound of voices and the crunching of footfalls in the gravel driveway below brought Haley and Annie from their separate reveries.\n\u201cI\u2019m good and sick of walking. You\u2019ve got a license. Why don\u2019t you put your foot down and demand to use the car?\u201d complained a high, melodic girl\u2019s voice.", 0.1279219576719577], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf":

such an effect. In one speech in this collection, he tells his audience: \u201cI\u2019ve been a coward about heroin and cocaine and LSD and so on\u2026. I did smoke a joint of marijuana one time with Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, just to be sociable. It didn\u2019t seem to do anything to me, one way or the other, so I never did it again.\u201d\nHardly the words of a hippie. One of the well-known hippies of that era, the writer Raymond Mungo, invited me and Vonnegut to visit the commune he started in Brattleboro, Vermont (and later wrote about in his memoir Total Loss Farm). He told us that one reason he and his friends wanted to start the commune and learn to \u201clive off the land\u201d in a simple way was that \u201cwe want to be the last people on earth.\u201d Vonnegut said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of a stuck-up kind of thing to want to be?\u201d\nIn the way he spoke and the way he wrote, Vonnegut was always coming up with the plain-spoken words and phrases that people thought but didn\u2019t say, the ideas that expressed inner feelings, that rattled preconceptions and made you look at things from a different angle. He was the one who pointed out \u201cthe elephant in the room,\u201d the one who saw that the Emperor had no clothes.\nThat same Raymond Mungo who ushered me and Vonnegut around his commune in 1970 emailed me recently after reading a book of Vonnegut\u2019s Letters that \u201cKurt was and remains an important writer and one who will be read beyond all our lifetimes.\u201d A new generation of Vonnegut fans was introduced to his work in 2005 when he appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart with his last book, A Man Without a Country, and teenagers are still moved today by his stories such as Harrison Bergeron that are taught in high school classes.\nVonnegut neither \u201cwrote down\u201d to his readers nor tried to go over their heads with wisdom. He was playful at the same time he was profound, and in that same style and spirit he spoke to graduating classes. He did not speak to them as if they were a different, lesser breed because they were young; he disdained \u201cgeneration generalizations.\u201d He told one of these graduating classes \u201c\u2026we are not members of different generations, as unlike, as some people would have us believe, as Eskimos and Australian Aborigines. We are all so close to each other in time that we should think of ourselves as brothers and sisters. \u2026 Whenever my children complain about the planet to me, I say \u2018Shut up! I just got here myself.\u2019\u201d (Vonnegut had three children of his own, and adopted four others.)\nPopular as he was as a graduation speaker, Vonnegut never graduated from college. He left Cornell to join the Army in World War II, and the Army sent him to study bacteriology at Butler University and mechanical engineering at Carnegie Tech and the University of Tennessee, then assigned him to the infantry and gave him a rifle. While serving as an advanced scout for the 106th Infantry in the Battle of the Bulge, he was captured by the Germans and sent to a prisoner of war Camp in Dresden, where he survived the firebombing of that city while quartered in an underground meat locker called Slaughterhouse-Five. When he came home from the war he studied anthropology at the University of Chicago on the G.I. Bill and worked as a reporter for the Chicago News Bureau. Although he completed all the course work for his master\u2019s degree, his ideas for a thesis were turned down, and he had to move on to take a job in public relations at General Electric. He was given an honorary degree by the university years later, after he was famous.\n\u201cSo it goes\u2026\u201d\nVonnegut\u2019s fame as a writer did not come until he was 47 years old. Before that he struggled to support a large family\u2014not only his wife and their own three children, but three children of his sister who died of cancer at age 41, a day after her husband had been killed when his commuter train crashed off a bridge. The popular weekly magazines of the fifties, whose payments for his short stories enabled Vonnegut to leave his job at General Electric, died off with the advent of television, and he had to scramble to make a living. He failed to sell a shirt company on his idea for a new kind of bow tie, had no success creating a new board game, opened a dealership for Saab automobiles when they were as yet little known in this country, and when that failed, commuted to Boston to write for an ad agency; he was turned down for a job teaching English at Cape Cod Community College, taught at a school for troubled boys, was turned down for a Guggenheim Fellowship, and through it all, kept writing. He died, in 2007, at the age of 84, still writing.\nHe was not about to peddle cut-rate formulas for overnight success or blue-sky bromides to young people who sought his advice.\nUnlike most graduation speakers, who have a \u201ccanned\u201d speech for all such occasions, simply inserting the name of a new university, Vonnegut brought something freshly minted, coming up with new ideas, new stories, new sources of wit and provocations to think. He did, however, have certain cherished themes that he managed to work in to almost all his talks\u2014the appreciation of teachers, the importance of noticing and acknowledging the small, sweet moments of everyday life by stopping to say, as his Uncle Alex had taught him, \u201cIf this isn\u2019t nice, what is?\u201d His messages to graduates were not all sweetness and light by a long shot. There is always his despair at the destruction of the planet, his contempt for the politicians who get us into war from the safety of their age and position, our need for the extended families and puberty ceremonies that gave strength to past societies and whose absence plagues our own.", 0.08229697250801146], "title": "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["vonnegut", 0.038461538461538464], ["imagination", 0.02564102564102564], ["humor", 0.02564102564102564], ["post", 0.02564102564102564], ["serving", 0.01282051282051282], ["preeminent", 0.01282051282051282], ["consciences", 0.01282051282051282], ["people", 0.01282051282051282], ["consistent", 0.01282051282051282], ["ills", 0.01282051282051282], ["dispatch", 0.01282051282051282], ["innovations", 0.01282051282051282], ["high", 0.01282051282051282], ["warped", 0.01282051282051282], ["including", 0.01282051282051282], ["questions", 0.01282051282051282], ["existence", 0.01282051282051282], ["ironic", 0.01282051282051282], ["range", 0.01282051282051282], ["comic", 0.01282051282051282], ["st", 0.01282051282051282], ["novelist", 0.01282051282051282], ["issues", 0.01282051282051282], ["droll", 0.01282051282051282], ["style", 0.01282051282051282], ["scathing", 0.01282051282051282], ["minneapolis", 0.01282051282051282], ["remind", 0.01282051282051282], ["pursued", 0.01282051282051282], ["century", 0.01282051282051282], ["philadelphia", 0.01282051282051282], ["denver", 0.01282051282051282], ["chuckling", 0.01282051282051282], ["originality", 0.01282051282051282], ["writers", 0.01282051282051282], ["details", 0.01282051282051282], ["inquirer", 0.01282051282051282], ["irreverent", 0.01282051282051282], ["comedy", 0.01282051282051282], ["decades", 0.01282051282051282], ["universal", 0.01282051282051282], ["wry", 0.01282051282051282], ["full", 0.01282051282051282], ["star", 0.01282051282051282], ["perceptions", 0.01282051282051282], ["20th", 0.01282051282051282], ["gal", 0.01282051282051282], ["wacky", 0.01282051282051282], ["characters", 0.01282051282051282], ["sadly", 0.01282051282051282], ["america", 0.01282051282051282], ["experimental", 0.01282051282051282], ["entire", 0.01282051282051282], ["evolution", 0.01282051282051282], ["condensation", 0.01282051282051282], ["lament", 0.01282051282051282], ["career", 0.01282051282051282], ["louis", 0.01282051282051282], ["work", 0.01282051282051282], ["relentlessly", 0.01282051282051282], ["pagos", 0.01282051282051282], ["outrageous", 0.01282051282051282], ["technical", 0.01282051282051282], ["sadness", 0.01282051282051282], ["wit", 0.01282051282051282], ["vision", 0.01282051282051282], ["logic", 0.01282051282051282], ["wild", 0.01282051282051282], ["tribune", 0.01282051282051282], ["beneath", 0.01282051282051282], ["side", 0.01282051282051282], ["triumph", 0.01282051282051282], ["darker", 0.01282051282051282]], "sentiment": ["\u2014People\n\u201cA triumph of style, originality and warped yet consistent logic \u2026 a condensation, an evolution of Vonnegut\u2019s entire career, including all the issues and questions he has pursued relentlessly for four decades.\u201d\n\u2014The Philadelphia Inquirer\n\u201cWild details, wry humor, outrageous characters \u2026 Gal\u00e1pagos is a comic lament, a sadly ironic vision.\u201d\n\u2014St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\u201cA WORK OF HIGH COMEDY, SADNESS AND IMAGINATION.\u201d\n\u2014The Denver Post\n\u201cWacky wit and irreverent imagination \u2026 and the full range of technical innovations have made [Vonnegut] America\u2019s preeminent experimental novelist.\u201d\n\u2014The Minneapolis Star and Tribune\n\u201cBeneath the droll humor, some scathing perceptions about 20th-century ills\u2026.

said Josef Broznik enthusiastically, gripping the guard rail and peering into the echoing blackness below. He was panting from the long climb up the mountain slope, and his bald head glistened with perspiration.\n\u201cA remarkable hole,\u201d said Josef\u2019s twenty-five-year-old brother, Peter, his long, big-jointed frame uncomfortable in fog-dampened clothes. He searched his thoughts for a more profound comment, but found nothing. It was a perfectly amazing hole\u2014no question about it. The officious mine supervisor, Borgorov, had said it had been sunk a half mile deep on the site of a radioactive mineral water spring. Borgorov\u2019s enthusiasm for the hole didn\u2019t seem in the least diminished by the fact that it had produced no uranium worth mining.\nPeter studied Borgorov with interest. He seemed a pompous ass of a young man, yet his name merited fear and respect whenever it was mentioned in a gathering of miners. It was said, not without awe, that he was the favorite third cousin of Stalin himself, and that he was merely serving an apprenticeship for much bigger things.\nPeter and his brother, Russia\u2019s leading myrmecologists, had been summoned from the University of Dnipropetrovsk to see the hole\u2014or, rather, to see the fossils that had come out of it. Myrmecology, they had explained to the hundred-odd guards who had stopped them on their way into the area, was that branch of science devoted to the study of ants. Apparently, the hole had struck a rich vein of petrified ants.\nPeter nudged a rock the size of his head and rolled it into the hole. He shrugged and walked away from it, whistling tunelessly. He was remembering again the humiliation of a month ago, when he had been forced to apologize publicly for his paper on Raptiformica sanguinea, the warlike, slave-raiding ants found under hedges. Peter had presented it to the world as a masterpiece of scholarship and scientific method, only to be rewarded by a stinging rebuke from Moscow. Men who couldn\u2019t tell Raptiformica sanguinea from centipedes had branded him an ideological backslider with dangerous tendencies toward Western decadence. Peter clenched and unclenched his fists, angry, frustrated. In effect, he had had to apologize because the ants he had studied would not behave the way the top Communist scientific brass wanted them to.\n\u201cProperly led,\u201d said Borgorov, \u201cpeople can accomplish anything they set their minds to. This hole was completed within a month from the time orders came down from Moscow. Someone very high dreamed we would find uranium on this very spot,\u201d he added mysteriously.\n\u201cYou will be decorated,\u201d said Peter absently, testing a point on the barbed wire around the opening. His reputation had preceded him into the area, he supposed. At any rate, Borgorov avoided his eyes, and addressed his remarks always to Josef\u2014Josef the rock, the dependable, the ideologically impeccable. It was Josef who had advised against publishing the controversial paper, Josef who had written his apology. Now, Josef was loudly comparing the hole to the Pyramids, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and the Colossus of Rhodes.\nBorgorov rambled on tiresomely, Josef agreed warmly, and Peter allowed his gaze and thoughts to wander over the strange new countryside. Beneath his feet were the Erzgebirge\u2014the Ore Mountains, dividing Russian-occupied Germany from Czechoslovakia. Gray rivers of men streamed to and from pits and caverns gouged in the green mountain slopes\u2014a dirty, red-eyed horde burrowing for uranium \u2026\n\u201cWhen would you like to see the fossil ants we found?\u201d said Borgorov, cutting into his thoughts. \u201cThey\u2019re locked up now, but we can get at them anytime tomorrow.

scuttled his demons with \u00e9lan as we played tennis and Ping-Pong, skipped off to afternoon movies and jaunts around town, feasted at steak houses and French restaurants, watched football games on television, and twice sat as guests in a box at Madison Square Garden to root for the Knicks.\nWith his signature gentle but mordant wit, Kurt participated in family celebrations, meetings of writers\u2019 organizations, and our gab and laugh sessions with Morley Safer and Don Farber, George Plimpton and Dan Wakefield, Walter Miller and Truman Capote, Kevin Buckley and Betty Friedan. I don\u2019t think it an exaggeration to suggest that I, as well as Kurt\u2019s other friends, felt that time with Kurt was a momentous gift no matter how light our conversation. We often found ourselves imitating his amused reserve about his own foibles and those of the world.\nAlong with the fun and warm support he so graciously expressed to his friends, Kurt Vonnegut treated me to intimate glimpses of the master storyteller whose ironic and frequently startling observations of people emphasized the moral complexities of life. Walking uptown after a memorial service for an unmarried female author who had devoted her life to literary criticism, Kurt said to me, \u201cNo children. No books. Few friends.\u201d His voice expressed empathic pain. Then he added, \u201cShe seemed to know what she was doing.\u201d\nAt Kurt\u2019s eightieth birthday party, John Leonard, a former editor of The New York Times Book Review, reflected on the experience of knowing and reading Kurt: \u201cVonnegut, like Abe Lincoln and Mark Twain, is always being funny when he\u2019s not being depressed,\u201d Leonard observed. \u201cHis is a weird jujitsu that throws us for a loop.\u201d\nThe Vonnegut acrobatics are off to a fast start in this circus of good and evil, fantasy and reality, tears and laughter. The first story, \u201cConfido,\u201d is about a magical device that provides instant conversation, advice, and therapy to the lonely. But\u2014and here comes the flip side\u2014Confido, the ingenious mind reader, eagerly reveals to its listeners their worse dissatisfactions, leading to painful discomfort with life. This story suggests not only the risks of psychiatry, where the patient may learn too much about himself/herself, but also the drastic spiritual consequences of biting the knowledge-bearing apple.\nAlthough I recall Kurt as being appreciative of his brief adventure with psychotherapy, misgivings about the practice of psychiatry are a recurring theme in this collection. \u201cLook at the Birdie\u201d begins with the narrator sitting at a bar, talking about a person he hates. \u201cLet me help you to think about it clearly,\u201d the man in a black mohair suit with a black string tie says to him. \u201cWhat you need are the calm, wise services of a murder counselor\u2026\u201d\nThis bizarre tale is resolved with a version of the old-fashioned O. Henry surprise ending that requires the reader\u2019s suspension of disbelief. But who can resist the enchantments of a storyteller who has a mad character tell us that a paranoiac is \u201ca person who has gone crazy in the most intelligent, well-informed way, the world being what it is\u201d? That\u2019s not just jujitsu. It\u2019s martial art.\nOther gems of Kurt\u2019s wit and verbal play, his dour but just about always humorous commentaries, punctuate these tales. \u201cFUBAR,\u201d a story title as well as theme, is defined for the reader by the bemused and sometimes mocking narrator as \u201cfouled up beyond all recognition.\u201d Then we are asked to consider that \u201cit is a particularly useful and interesting word in that it describes a misfortune brought about not by malice but by administrative accidents in some large and complex organization.\u201d\nWith one brief sentence, the weather in Indianapolis, Kurt\u2019s hometown, which is the scene for the story \u201cHall of Mirrors,\u201d is vividly described. Although the first words of the sentence lead us to expect a lovely nature ramble, the balance surprisingly allows the reader to see, feel, and hear the ugly chill. \u201cAutumn winds, experimenting with the idea of a hard winter, made little twists of soot and paper, made the plastic propellers over the used car lot go frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.\u201d Twenty-eight rs by my count. How\u2019s that for sound effects in prose that says it all, courtesy of Kurt Vonnegut!\nOne of the few stories with an unhappy ending, \u201cThe Nice Little People\u201d provides a preview of the coming attractions of Kurt\u2019s later career as a novelist. We are engaged by a reversal of the familiar image of larger than life space aliens: In Kurt\u2019s tale, a platoon of sweet, tiny, insectlike folk descend in a spaceship the size and shape of a paper knife. They turn out to be frightened creatures whom Lowell Swift, a linoleum salesman, befriends. But on guard! The role the aliens play in the resolution of Swift\u2019s deteriorating marriage is as harrowing as it is unpredictable. Unpredictable! Hmm. I should have suspected that!
