affected him most was that of his first wife, mother of his three children, and de facto mother to the three Adams boys: Jane Cox Vonnegut Yarmolinsky (in 1984, she married Adam Yarmolinksy, who served in many capacities in the Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter administrations). Jane died on December 19, 1986, after a five-year bout with cancer. A decade later, Kurt movingly recounted in an autobiographical section of his novel Timequake a lovely conversation he had with Jane two weeks before she died: \u201cJane could believe with all her heart anything that made being alive seem full of white magic. That was her strength. She was raised a Quaker, but stopped going to meetings of Friends after her four happy years at Swarthmore. She became an Episcopalian after marrying Adam, who remained a Jew. She died believing in the Trinity and Heaven and Hell and all the rest of it. I\u2019m so glad. Why? Because I loved her.\u201d\nJanuary 4, 1980\nNew York City\nTO DONALD FIENE\nKurt had, along with Edward Albee, William Styron, and John Updike, protested the supression of a Soviet literary magazine, Metropole.\nDear Don\u2014\nWell, shit\u2014I received news this morning that Rita did not get elected an honorary member of the National Institute and Academy. It is my fault. I was so damned innocent. I thought her nomination (seconded by Miller and Updike) would be so appealing that she would be a shoo-in. Too late have I learned, unsurprisingly, that the making of honorary members is a highly political enterprise, with all sorts of lobbying and pressure plays required. Those who did make it are all international celebrities\u2014Angus Wilson and the like. It is pointless to nominate anyone for any sort of honor, I have found, who is not as well known as Bianca Jagger.\nI sent Rita a chatty and affectionate description of Jill\u2019s and my wedding. That was on November 30 or so. I have had no reply. She called me on my birthday, as she always does, and indicated that she had no work and expected no work. Things were hopeless, and she allowed me to suspect, I think, that my protest about the Metropole affair was partly to blame. I have heard from Americans who were in Moscow in the past few months that serious artists are exhausted at last, are giving up on doing anything much that might be deep or complicated. They talk now of getting out of the country somehow. Only if they can get out from under the dead weight of the bureaucracy, they now seem to feel, can they experiment and, with some luck, grow. The bureaucrats, for their part, I\u2019m sure, would like to see the society do without serious artists entirely.

["\u201cConstableville. The stop is Constableville. Next station, Remsen.\u201d\nA poker game was going on in the facing seats behind Paul, and a superannuated first sergeant, zebra-like under symbols for patience, individual bloodlettings, and separations from home, was telling tales of the last war\u2014of the Last War.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d he said, riffling through the deck absently, as though his mind were a thousand miles away, \u201cthere we was, and there they was. Imagine the men\u2019s room there\u2019s a hogback, with the bastards dug in deep on the reverse slope.\u201d The recruits looked at the men\u2019s room through narrowed, battle-wise eyes, and the sergeant shuffled the cards some more. \u201cThe night before, a lucky shot knocked out the generator.\u201d\n\u201cHoly cow!\u201d said a recruit.\n\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d said the sergeant. \u201cAnyway\u2014five-card stud, nothing wild\u2014there we were with no juice, eighteen of us facing five hundred of them. The microwave sentinels, the proximity mines, the electric fence, the fire-control system, the remote-control machine gun nests\u2014pfft! No juice, Queen, ace, ace, and dealer gets a deuce. Bet the first ace.\n\u201cWell, boys\u2014a dime to me? Raise it a dime just to make things interesting. Well, boys, then the fun started. At seven hundred hours they tried a hundred-man patrol on us, to see what we had. And we had nothin\u2019! And communications was cut to hell, so we couldn\u2019t call for nothin\u2019. All our robot tanks\u2019d been pulled out to support a push the 106th was makin\u2019, so we was really alone. Snafu. So, I sent Corporal Merganthaler back to battalion for help.\u2014Two queens, no help, two aces, and dealer catches another lousy deuce. Bet the aces. So over they come, screamin\u2019 bloody murder, and us with nothing but our goddamn rifles and bayonets workin\u2019. Looked like a tidal wave comin\u2019 over at us.\u2014Aces check? Aw, hell, deuces\u2019ll try a dime.\u2014Just then, up comes Merganthaler with a truck and generator he\u2019s moonlight-requisitioned from the 57th. We hooked her into our lines, cranked her up, and my God, I wish you could of seen it. The poor bastards fryin\u2019 on the electric fence, the proximity mines poppin\u2019 under \u2019em, the microwave sentinels openin\u2019 up with the remote-control machine-gun nests, and the fire-control system swiveling the guns and flamethrowers around as long as anything was quiverin\u2019 within a mile of the place. And that\u2019s how I got the Silver Star.\u201d\nPaul shook his head slightly as he listened to the sergeant\u2019s absurd tale. That, then, was the war he had been so eager to get into at one time, the opportunity for basic, hot-tempered, hard-muscled heroism he regretted having missed. There had been plenty of death, plenty of pain, all right, and plenty of tooth-grinding stoicism and nerve. But men had been called upon chiefly to endure by the side of the machines, the terrible engines that fought with their own kind for the right to gorge themselves on men. Horatio on the bridge had become a radio-guided rocket with an atomic warhead and a proximity fuse. Roland and Oliver had become a pair of jet-driven computers hurtling toward each other far faster than the flight of a man\u2019s scream. The great tradition of the American rifleman survived only symbolically, in volleys fired into the skies over the dead in thousands of military cemeteries. Those in the graves, the front-line dead, were heirs to another American tradition as old as that of the rifleman, but once a peaceful tradition\u2014that of the American tinker.\n\u201cGosh! Sarge, how come you never went after a commission?\u201d\n\u201cMe go back to college at my age? I\u2019m not the school kind, sonny. Gettin\u2019 that B.S. was enough for me. Two more years and an M.A. for a pair of lousy gold bars? Naaaaaah!\u2014And a queen, and no help, and a jack, and no help, and a five, and no help, and dealer gets a\u2014what do you know? Three deuces. Looks like my lucky day, boys.\u201d\n\u201cMiddleville. The stop is Middleville.

jobs he gave it. The rest of the time, it sat motionless in the closet, looking dazed and using almost no energy. Konigswasser told me the other day that he used to run the thing for about a dollar a week, just taking it out when he really needed it.\nBut the best part was that Konigswasser didn\u2019t have to sleep any more, just because it had to sleep; or be afraid any more, just because it thought it might get hurt; or go looking for things it seemed to think it had to have. And, when it didn\u2019t feel well, Konigswasser kept out of it until it felt better, and he didn\u2019t have to spend a fortune keeping the thing comfortable.\nWhen he got his body out of the closet to write, he did a book on how to get out of one\u2019s own body, which was rejected without comment by twenty-three publishers. The twenty-fourth sold two million copies, and the book changed human life more than the invention of fire, numbers, the alphabet, agriculture, or the wheel. When somebody told Konigswasser that, he snorted that they were damning his book with faint praise. I\u2019d say he had a point there.\nBy following the instructions in Konigswasser\u2019s book for about two years, almost anybody could get out of his body whenever he wanted to. The first step was to understand what a parasite and dictator the body was most of the time, then to separate what the body wanted or didn\u2019t want from what you yourself\u2014your psyche\u2014wanted or didn\u2019t want. Then, by concentrating on what you wanted, and ignoring as much as possible what the body wanted beyond plain maintenance, you made your psyche demand its rights and become self-sufficient.\nThat\u2019s what Konigswasser had done without realizing it, until he and his body had parted company in the park, with his psyche going to watch the lions eat, and with his body wandering out of control into the lagoon.\nThe final trick of separation, once your psyche grew independent enough, was to start your body walking in some direction and suddenly take your psyche off in another direction. You couldn\u2019t do it standing still, for some reason\u2014you had to walk.\nAt first, Madge\u2019s and my psyches were clumsy at getting along outside our bodies, like the first sea animals that got stranded on land millions of years ago, and who could just waddle and squirm and gasp in the mud. But we became better at it with time, because the psyche can naturally adapt so much faster than the body.\nMadge and I had good reason for wanting to get out. Everybody who was crazy enough to try to get out at the first had good reasons. Madge\u2019s body was sick and wasn\u2019t going to last a lot longer. With her going in a little while, I couldn\u2019t work up enthusiasm for sticking around much longer myself. So we studied Konigswasser\u2019s book and tried to get Madge out of her body before it died. I went along with her, to keep either one of us from getting lonely. And we just barely made it\u2014six weeks before her body went all to pieces.\nThat\u2019s why we get to march every year in the Pioneers\u2019 Day Parade. Not everybody does\u2014only the first five thousand of us who turned amphibious. We were guinea pigs, without much to lose one way or another, and we were the ones who proved to the rest how pleasant and safe it was\u2014a heck of a lot safer than taking chances in a body year in and year out.\nSooner or later, almost everybody had a good reason for giving it a try. There got to be millions and finally more than a billion of us\u2014invisible, insubstantial, indestructible, and, by golly, true to ourselves, no trouble to anybody, and not afraid of anything.", 0.13319264069264067], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["obsolete", 0.09090909090909091], ["clown", 0.09090909090909091], ["woodly", 0.06060606060606061], ["poison", 0.06060606060606061], ["pointing", 0.030303030303030304], ["treacherous", 0.030303030303030304], ["borgia", 0.030303030303030304], ["harold", 0.030303030303030304], ["peace", 0.030303030303030304], ["drank", 0.030303030303030304], ["touched", 0.030303030303030304], ["seeping", 0.030303030303030304], ["head", 0.030303030303030304], ["lobe", 0.030303030303030304], ["mind", 0.030303030303030304], ["horror", 0.030303030303030304], ["cigar", 0.030303030303030304], ["understanding", 0.030303030303030304], ["refused", 0.030303030303030304], ["potassium", 0.030303030303030304], ["thought", 0.030303030303030304], ["humidor", 0.030303030303030304], ["frantically", 0.030303030303030304], ["lucretia", 0.030303030303030304], ["lover", 0.030303030303030304], ["cyanide", 0.030303030303030304], ["poisoned", 0.030303030303030304]], "sentiment": ["(pointing at WOODLY in horror)\nLucretia Borgia?\n(looking around frantically) Something I drank or touched?
