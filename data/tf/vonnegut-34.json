more effectively than the discovery that your previously acceptable behavior has become ridiculous.\u201d He said in conversation at the 2001 clambake: \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t learned how to live without a culture and a society, acculturation would have broken my heart a thousand times.\u201d\nIn Timequake One, I had Trout discard his \u201cThe Sisters B-36\u201d in a lidless wire trash receptacle chained to a fire hydrant in front of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, way-the-hell-and-gone up on West 155th Street in Manhattan, two doors west of Broadway. This was on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, 2000, supposedly fifty-one days before the timequake zapped everybody and everything back to 1991.\nThe members of the Academy, I said, who were addicted to making old-fashioned art in old-fashioned ways, without computers, were experiencing acculturation. They were like the two artistic sisters on the matriarchal planet Booboo in the Crab Nebula.\nThere really is an American Academy of Arts and Letters. Its palatial headquarters are where I placed them in Timequake One. There really is a fire hydrant out front. There really is a library inside, and an art gallery and reception halls and meeting rooms and staff offices, and a very grand auditorium.\nBy an act of Congress passed in 1916, the Academy can have no more than 250 members, American citizens, all of whom have distinguished themselves as novelists, dramatists, poets, historians, essayists, critics, composers of music, architects, painters, or sculptors. Their ranks are regularly diminished by the Grim Reaper, by death. A task of the survivors is to nominate and then, by secret ballot, elect persons to fill the vacancies.\nAmong the Academy\u2019s founders were old-fashioned writers such as Henry Adams and William and Henry James, and Samuel Clemens, and the old-fashioned composer Edward MacDowell. Their audiences were necessarily small.

sidewalk. Haley followed, forgetting to thank the bemused driver, and pursued his companion, who disappeared into the tight currents of the city\u2019s Sunday strollers.\nHe caught up with him at an intersection, in the bizarre shadows of the elevated overhead. Mr. Banghart was talking earnestly with a policeman, who pointed down the street and shouted above the rumble of trains. \u201cThe employment office opens at 8 in the morning,\u201d the policeman said. \u201cGot any money for food and a bed tonight?\u201d Mr. Banghart shrugged and grinned sheepishly. \u201cThen hurry up and get over to the Mission before all the beds are gone,\u201d said the policeman severely. He tapped Mr. Banghart\u2019s shoulder lightly with his nightstick. \u201cAnd keep out of trouble.\u201d\nHaley kept his distance until the policeman had finished his piece, then walked beside Mr. Banghart, who took no notice of him, but strode along, muttering to himself. Haley read his lips. \u201cKeep out of trouble, keep out of trouble,\u201d he was saying.\nHaley nudged his arm to get his attention. His companion\u2019s reaction was instant and violent. Haley felt himself seized by his gathered shirtfront and twisted to face Mr. Banghart. \u201cJust let the others make sure they keep out of trouble, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Mr. Banghart fiercely. He relaxed his grip under the fascinated glances of passers-by eddying about them. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cdidn\u2019t mean anything by it. I know you\u2019re a friend.\u201d\nHaley\u2019s impulse was to get away from Mr. Banghart, whose eyes grew more lunatic by the second, but the ranks of unfamiliar faces seemed the more ominous, so he continued to trudge, fearfully, by his side. Following the policeman\u2019s directions, the two of them turned a corner and found themselves on a quiet side street, three blocks long. The city\u2019s noises sounded like a distant surf behind them. Warehouse walls banked the street\u2019s left side, their blank brick faces daubed with posters \u2014 tattered reminders of a war bond drive, a musical comedy, a political campaign, of The Greatest Show on Earth. Haley looked from these to the buildings facing them, his eyes running from the twin green globes marking a police station, the worst of Victorian architecture patinated with soot, to a dozen narrow-fronted hotels, taverns, pawnshops, and, at the far end, the blinking cross of the Mission. As though in bas relief, the still, gray figures of silent men stood in doorways or napped on stone steps and the lower treads of fire escapes.\n\u201cHey, buddy, give a pal a smoke, will you?\u201d said a toothless man, stepping from the shadows of an alley.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t smoke,\u201d said Haley weakly.\n\u201cTrash,\u201d said Mr. Banghart. \u201cIgnore them.\u201d\n\u201cHey pal, lemme talk to you a minute\u2026 Buddy, got a cigarette?\u2026 Spare a dime?\u201d whined 100 voices as Haley and Mr. Banghart picked their way to the Mission.

Billy had never seen Weary\u2019s face. He had tried to imagine it one time, had imagined a toad in a fishbowl.\nWeary kicked and shoved Billy for a quarter of a mile. The scouts were waiting between the banks of a frozen creek. They had heard the dog. They had heard men calling back and forth, too\u2014calling like hunters who had a pretty good idea of where their quarry was.\nThe banks of the creek were high enough to allow the scouts to stand without being seen. Billy staggered down the bank ridiculously. After him came Weary, clanking and clinking and tinkling and hot.\n\u201cHere he is, boys,\u201d said Weary. \u201cHe don\u2019t want to live, but he\u2019s gonna live anyway. When he gets out of this, by God, he\u2019s gonna owe his life to the Three Musketeers.\u201d This was the first the scouts had heard that Weary thought of himself and them as the Three Musketeers.\nBilly Pilgrim, there in the creekbed, thought he, Billy Pilgrim, was turning to steam painlessly.

expert could tell Gokubi from Mandarax.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nGokubi and Mandarax both had pressure-sensitive buttons on their backs, set flush with their cases, by means of which a person might communicate with whatever it was that had been put inside. On the face of each was an identical screen on which images could be caused to appear, and which also functioned as a solar cell, charging tiny batteries which, again, were exactly the same in Gokubi and Mandarax.\nEach had a microphone the size of a pinhead at the upper right-hand corner of its screen. It was by means of this that Gokubi or Mandarax heard spoken language, and then, in accordance with instructions from its buttons, translated them into words on its screen.\nAn operator of either instrument had to be as quick and graceful with his hands as a magician, if a bilingual conversation was to flow at all naturally. If I were an English-speaking person talking to a Portuguese, say, I would have to hold the instrument somewhere near the mouth of the Portuguese, but with the screen close enough to my eyes for me to read the written translation into English of what he was saying. And then I would have to flip it over quickly, so that the instrument could hear me, and so he could read from the screen what I was saying.\nNo person living today has hands clever enough or a brain big enough to operate a Gokubi or a Mandarax. Nobody can thread a needle, either\u2014or play the piano, or pick his or her nose, as the case may be.\nGokubi could translate among only ten languages. Mandarax could translate among a thousand. Gokubi had to be told what language it was hearing. Mandarax could identify every one of the thousand languages after hearing only a few words, and begin to translate those words into the operator\u2019s language without being told.\nBoth were highly accurate clocks and perpetual calendars. The clock of *Zenji Hiroguchi\u2019s Mandarax lost only eighty-two seconds between the time he checked into the Hotel El Dorado and, thirty-one years later, when Mary Hepburn and the instrument were eaten by a great white shark.\nGokubi would have kept track of time just as accurately, but in all other respects Mandarax left its father far behind. Not only could Mandarax traffic in one hundred times more languages than its progenitor and correctly diagnose more diseases than the majority of physicians of that time. It could also name on command important events which happened in any given year. If you punched out on its back 1802, for example, the year of Charles Darwin\u2019s birth, Mandarax would tell you that Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo were also born then, and that Beethoven completed his Second Symphony, and that France suppressed a Negro rebellion in Santo Domingo, and that Gottfried Treveranus coined the term biology, and that the Health and Morals of Apprentices Act became law in Britain, and on and on. That was also the year in which Napoleon became President of the Italian Republic.\nMandarax knew the rules, too, for two hundred games, and could recite the basic principles laid down by masters for fifty different arts and crafts. It could moreover recall on command any one of twenty thousand popular quotations from literature. So that, if you punched out on its back the word Sunset, for example, these lofty sentiments would appear on its screen:", 0.10006775067750678], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["buried", 0.021897810218978103], ["dorothy", 0.014598540145985401], ["parents", 0.014598540145985401], ["wives", 0.014598540145985401], ["artist", 0.014598540145985401], ["second", 0.014598540145985401], ["barn", 0.014598540145985401], ["remarried", 0.014598540145985401], ["murdered", 0.014598540145985401], ["asked", 0.014598540145985401], ["war", 0.014598540145985401], ["teachers", 0.014598540145985401], ["bluebeard", 0.014598540145985401], ["thought", 0.014598540145985401], ["bodies", 0.014598540145985401], ["time", 0.014598540145985401], ["forbidden", 0.0072992700729927005], ["aghast", 0.0072992700729927005], ["course", 0.0072992700729927005], ["suicide", 0.0072992700729927005], ["graves", 0.0072992700729927005], ["draughtsman", 0.0072992700729927005], ["concerned", 0.0072992700729927005], ["cemetery", 0.0072992700729927005], ["creations", 0.0072992700729927005], ["ararat", 0.0072992700729927005], ["save", 0.0072992700729927005], ["advice", 0.0072992700729927005], ["catches", 0.0072992700729927005], ["putting", 0.0072992700729927005], ["valuable", 0.0072992700729927005], ["foot", 0.0072992700729927005], ["impractical", 0.0072992700729927005], ["killed", 0.0072992700729927005], ["mystery", 0.0072992700729927005], ["school", 0.0072992700729927005], ["die", 0.0072992700729927005], ["chamber", 0.0072992700729927005], ["river", 0.0072992700729927005], ["gazing", 0.0072992700729927005], ["husband", 0.0072992700729927005], ["widow", 0.0072992700729927005], ["people", 0.0072992700729927005], ["artists", 0.0072992700729927005], ["dead", 0.0072992700729927005], ["expect", 0.0072992700729927005], ["notwithstanding", 0.0072992700729927005], ["insurance", 0.0072992700729927005], ["best", 0.0072992700729927005], ["jackson", 0.0072992700729927005], ["paintings", 0.0072992700729927005], ["sarasota", 0.0072992700729927005], ["public", 0.0072992700729927005], ["unconscious", 0.0072992700729927005], ["seconds", 0.0072992700729927005], ["men", 0.0072992700729927005], ["surely", 0.0072992700729927005], ["yards", 0.0072992700729927005], ["personable", 0.0072992700729927005], ["kitchen", 0.0072992700729927005], ["suggested", 0.0072992700729927005], ["boy", 0.0072992700729927005], ["works", 0.0072992700729927005], ["career", 0.0072992700729927005], ["intolerable", 0.0072992700729927005], ["florida", 0.0072992700729927005], ["edith", 0.0072992700729927005], ["studio", 0.0072992700729927005], ["golden", 0.0072992700729927005], ["point", 0.0072992700729927005], ["dink", 0.0072992700729927005], ["accounts", 0.0072992700729927005], ["wasn", 0.0072992700729927005], ["impressed", 0.0072992700729927005], ["story", 0.0072992700729927005], ["casket", 0.0072992700729927005], ["eye", 0.0072992700729927005], ["capable", 0.0072992700729927005], ["divorce", 0.0072992700729927005], ["system", 0.0072992700729927005], ["pollock", 0.0072992700729927005], ["circe", 0.0072992700729927005], ["head", 0.0072992700729927005], ["shell", 0.0072992700729927005], ["door", 0.0072992700729927005], ["happily", 0.0072992700729927005], ["lives", 0.0072992700729927005], ["eyed", 0.0072992700729927005], ["prices", 0.0072992700729927005], ["appreciated", 0.0072992700729927005], ["locked", 0.0072992700729927005], ["pursue", 0.0072992700729927005], ["mount", 0.0072992700729927005], ["wife", 0.0072992700729927005], ["condominium", 0.0072992700729927005], ["knocked", 0.0072992700729927005], ["minutes", 0.0072992700729927005], ["san", 0.0072992700729927005], ["pieces", 0.0072992700729927005], ["dear", 0.0072992700729927005], ["lived", 0.0072992700729927005], ["ignacio", 0.0072992700729927005], ["poverty", 0.0072992700729927005], ["generally", 0.0072992700729927005], ["ideas", 0.0072992700729927005], ["beach", 0.0072992700729927005], ["poor", 0.0072992700729927005], ["keys", 0.0072992700729927005], ["rinky", 0.0072992700729927005], ["berman", 0.0072992700729927005], ["collection", 0.0072992700729927005], ["terry", 0.0072992700729927005], ["man", 0.0072992700729927005], ["ago", 0.0072992700729927005], ["beachfront", 0.0072992700729927005], ["potato", 0.0072992700729927005], ["finds", 0.0072992700729927005], ["green", 0.0072992700729927005], ["fact", 0.0072992700729927005], ["jack", 0.0072992700729927005]], "sentiment": ["He catches her just at the point she is gazing aghast at the bodies of all his former wives in there, all of whom he has murdered, save for the first one, for looking behind the door.

She is after me all the time to tell her where the six keys are, and I tell her again that they are buried in a golden casket at the foot of Mount Ararat.\nI said to her the last time she asked, which was about five minutes ago: \u201cLook: think about something else, anything else.

Her second husband was what we both thought I might become right after the war: a capable and personable insurance man. We each have a beach.\nMy second wife, dear Edith, is buried in Green River Cemetery out here, where I expect to be buried, too\u2014only a few yards, in fact, from the graves of Jackson Pollock and Terry Kitchen.\nIf I killed anybody in the war, and I just might have, it would have been during the few seconds before a shell from somewhere knocked me unconscious and took out one eye.\nWhen I was a two-eyed boy, I was the best draughtsman they had ever seen in the rinky-dink public school system of San Ignacio, which wasn\u2019t saying much. Several of my teachers were so impressed that they suggested to my parents that perhaps I should pursue a career as an artist.\nBut this advice seemed so impractical to my parents that they asked the teachers to stop putting such ideas in my head. They thought that artists lived in poverty, and that they had to die before their works were appreciated. They were generally right about that, of course. The paintings by dead men who were poor most of their lives are the most valuable pieces in my collection.\nAnd if an artist wants to really jack up the prices of his creations, may I suggest this: suicide.", 0.16004464285714287], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "a-man-without-a-country": {"tfidf": [["em", 0.03125], ["washington", 0.03125], ["noticed", 0.03125], ["case", 0.03125], ["educated", 0.0234375], ["guessers", 0.0234375], ["kill", 0.015625], ["millions", 0.015625], ["good", 0.015625], ["race", 0.015625], ["fired", 0.015625], ["religion", 0.015625], ["dehumanized", 0.015625], ["guess", 0.015625], ["educations", 0.015625], ["hydrogen", 0.015625], ["salvo", 0.0078125], ["rest", 0.0078125], ["bright", 0.0078125], ["human", 0.0078125], ["hell", 0.0078125], ["knowledge", 0.0078125], ["thinking", 0.0078125], ["hated", 0.0078125], ["charge", 0.0078125], ["going", 0.0078125], ["thousands", 0.0078125], ["torture", 0.0078125], ["powerful", 0.0078125], ["couple", 0.0078125], ["vast", 0.0078125], ["enemy", 0.0078125], ["announced", 0.0078125], ["bombs", 0.0078125], ["yale", 0.0078125], ["simply", 0.0078125], ["guessing", 0.0078125], ["ten", 0.0078125], ["people", 0.0078125], ["uninhibited", 0.0078125], ["result", 0.0078125], ["soldiers", 0.0078125], ["feared", 0.0078125], ["planet", 0.0078125], ["lovers", 0.0078125], ["weapons", 0.0078125], ["moderate", 0.0078125], ["nazis", 0.0078125], ["pitiless", 0.0078125], ["boisterous", 0.0078125], ["seventh", 0.0078125], ["cake", 0.0078125], ["reason", 0.0078125], ["harvard", 0.0078125], ["throw", 0.0078125], ["unopposed", 0.0078125], ["months", 0.0078125], ["florida", 0.0078125], ["jawed", 0.0078125], ["stand", 0.0078125], ["social", 0.0078125], ["lonesome", 0.0078125], ["arbitrarily", 0.0078125], ["disenfranchised", 0.0078125], ["simple", 0.0078125], ["graders", 0.0078125], ["highly", 0.0078125], ["will", 0.0078125], ["beings", 0.0078125], ["americans", 0.0078125], ["leaders", 0.0078125], ["attack", 0.0078125], ["low", 0.0078125], ["survive", 0.0078125], ["war", 0.0078125], ["shamelessly", 0.0078125], ["released", 0.0078125], ["outnumber", 0.0078125], ["jut", 0.0078125], ["doctors", 0.0078125], ["haters", 0.0078125], ["imprison", 0.0078125], ["grinning", 0.0078125], ["rigged", 0.0078125], ["piece", 0.0078125], ["election", 0.0078125], ["poisons", 0.0078125], ["unelected", 0.0078125], ["medical", 0.0078125], ["education", 0.0078125], ["wound", 0.0078125], ["class", 0.0078125], ["persons", 0.0078125], ["weaponry", 0.0078125], ["response", 0.0078125], ["remember", 0.0078125], ["fund", 0.0078125], ["appallingly", 0.0078125], ["clear", 0.0078125], ["person", 0.0078125], ["african", 0.0078125], ["fact", 0.0078125]], "sentiment": ["And if you actually are an educated, thinking person, you will not be welcome in Washington, D.C.

was handsome in appearance, with charming manners, and although dignified and reserved, soon had many friends who remained devoted to him. He joined the University Club, then situated at Meridian and Michigan Streets, which was the most exclusive men\u2019s club in the City. He was received and accepted by the best families as a most eligible bachelor. He was generally approved by doting mamas looking for suitable mates for their daughters, and had the pick of the crop of debutantes. After a couple of years of a happy and carefree existence, Kurt began to court Edith Lieber, who was four years his junior and had likewise returned to an active social life after attending Miss Shipley\u2019s School at Bryn Mawr and traveling much abroad. Her father, Albert Lieber, was then in the full tide of success as one of the town\u2019s rich men. He resided on a beautiful estate of some hundred acres just to the northwest of the city, in a large residence which he had recently constructed.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cEdith was a very beautiful woman, tall and statuesque. Kurt always admired her beauty and was very proud of her. They fell in love, became engaged, and were married on November 22, 1913. They remained a devoted couple until the day of Edith\u2019s death thirty-one years later. The marriage was approved by both families; but the Schnull-Vonnegut clan was slightly condescending. In the pecking order in the social hierarchy of the community, and particularly in the German group it was generally understood that the Schnull-Vonnegut clan ranked ahead of the Lieber-Barus clan.\n\u201cEdith was a rather tall woman, about five feet eight inches, with a fine graceful figure. She was auburn-haired, not quite red, with a very fair, clear skin, finely modeled features, and blue-green eyes. She was stately and dignified in bearing. She had a lively sense of humor and laughed easily. Her adolescent years had been difficult with her odious stepmother, but she was strong enough in spirit and courage to endure her ordeal, although the scars were there.\n\u201cPrior to her engagement and marriage to Kurt, Edith had been engaged to other men but had each time broken her engagement. These suitors were all Europeans; for in the years from 1907 to 1913 Edith lived mostly abroad. As an extremely handsome woman and the daughter of an American millionaire she was much courted.\n\u201cShe first became engaged to Kenneth Doulton, an Englishman, a grandson of Sir Henry Doulton, and a scion of the family which for generations had owned the world-famous Royal Doulton Porcelain Works in Lambeth. She met him while visiting the Thompsons for the London season of 1908 in the waning days of the Edwardian twilight of elegance and sophistication when the rich could still enjoy their privileges. Doulton was an attractive member of the upper-middle class with connections in the aristocracy. He was a charming idler and of course expected Albert to supply a suitable settlement as a dowry upon his lovely daughter. Albert enjoyed a large income at that time but was not enthusiastic to part with his modest capital. And Doulton was not about to go in the brewery business in Indianapolis. He wanted to marry Edith, have her father buy them a country place and a little house in Mayfair, and remain in old England. Edith demurred and the engagement was broken.\n\u201cIn the First World War Doulton as a junior officer in a Guard\u2019s regiment lost his life while serving in the first British Expeditionary Force in the first months of the war.\n\u201cEdith then forsook merrie England and shifted her European base of operations from London to Dusseldorf. From 1909 to 1913 she spent most of each year staying with her grandfather, Peter, then past eighty, and her maiden aunt Laura, in the old man\u2019s Schloss on the Rhine. He was no longer Consul General of the United States but he kept the Stars and Stripes flying over his palace and retained his American citizenship to the end. But his three children, Laura, Emily, and Rudolph, became German citizens. Rudolph adopted a military career, went through the Cadet School and became Lieutenant Colonel of a regiment of cavalry\u2014the Uhlans\u2014garrisoned in the area of Dusseldorf. Emily married a German army officer. Edith was thus thrown into the company of subalterns in her uncle\u2019s famous regiment. At that time the Kaiser\u2019s army officers constituted a sort of elite social group with many privileges and much prestige. The Kaiser\u2019s pay and allowances to his officers were extremely meager. If an officer did not have substantial means to supplement his pay and maintain the position required of him, he was expected to marry a rich wife. In fact, he could not marry except with the consent of the colonel of his regiment; and the consent was withheld until the social position, reputability, and dowry of the bride were officially approved.\n\u201cEdith\u2019s first serious German suitor was Lieutenant Paul Genth of the Uhlans. She gave him the go-by after a brief courtship. Shortly afterward Captain Otto Voigt of the regiment proposed to her, and after a spirited courtship was accepted by her with the consent of her family and of his commanding officer. The Captain was a dashing figure in his colorful dress uniform with shako and \u2019Merry Widow\u2019 accoutrements.\n\u201cBut here again the course of true love did not run true and smooth. There were difficulties about the dowry, and the prospect for Edith of a career as an army wife in the highly artificial and regulated life of the imperial army palled upon her. Captain Voigt was one of those heel-clicking Prussian-type officers who looked good in his uniform in command of his squadron of cavalry but was quite different from the easygoing, indulgent, and deferential American husbands of Edith\u2019s experience. She wavered. But Albert gave her carte blanche to buy a trousseau and she proceeded to do so. All of the linens were duly embroidered \u2019L-V.\u2019 The Liebers of the German branch thought it was a great match.\u201d", 0.2168722943722944], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["thing", 0.07894736842105263], ["magazines", 0.05263157894736842], ["rub", 0.05263157894736842], ["verne", 0.05263157894736842], ["nose", 0.05263157894736842], ["office", 0.02631578947368421], ["doll", 0.02631578947368421], ["generally", 0.02631578947368421], ["approximate", 0.02631578947368421], ["brought", 0.02631578947368421], ["baby", 0.02631578947368421], ["girl", 0.02631578947368421], ["open", 0.02631578947368421], ["pay", 0.02631578947368421], ["extensively", 0.02631578947368421], ["cummerbunds", 0.02631578947368421], ["wouldn", 0.02631578947368421], ["picture", 0.02631578947368421], ["boy", 0.02631578947368421], ["read", 0.02631578947368421], ["stenographer", 0.02631578947368421], ["bothered", 0.02631578947368421], ["kiss", 0.02631578947368421], ["desk", 0.02631578947368421], ["front", 0.02631578947368421], ["lady", 0.02631578947368421], ["articles", 0.02631578947368421], ["practically", 0.02631578947368421], ["dollars", 0.02631578947368421], ["magazine", 0.02631578947368421], ["place", 0.02631578947368421], ["time", 0.02631578947368421]], "sentiment": ["A: That\u2019s another thing they generally have articles on\u2014cummerbunds.\nQ: You seem to have read these magazines rather extensively yourself.\nA: I had the desk right next to Verne\u2019s.

ones for my own operations. I particularly needed people who were tri-lingual, who were fluent in both German and English, and in either French or Russian as well. They also had to be trustworthy, polite, and presentable. So I got out of my car to have a closer look at the interrogations. I discovered that they were being conducted, surprisingly, by a seeming Gypsy boy. It was my Ruth, of course. Her hair had all been cut off at a de-lousing station. She was wearing Army fatigues without any badges of unit or rank. She was beautiful to watch as she tried to elicit a glimmer of understanding from a ragbag of a man, whom the M.P.\u2019s held before her. She must have tried seven or eight languages on him, slipping from one to another as easily as a musician changing tempos and keys. Not only that, but she altered her gestures, too, so that her hands were always doing appropriate dances to each language.\nSuddenly, the man\u2019s hands were dancing as hers were, and the sounds coming from his mouth were like those she was making. As Ruth would tell me later, he was a Macedonian peasant from southern Yugoslavia. The language they had found in common was Bulgarian. He had been taken prisoner by the Germans, even though he had never been a soldier, and had been sent as a slave laborer to strengthen the forts of the Siegfried Line. He had never learned German. Now he wanted to go to America, he told Ruth, to become a very rich man. He was shipped back to Macedonia, I presume.\nRuth was then twenty-six years old\u2014but she had eaten so bad for seven years, mostly potatoes and turnips, that she was an asexual stick. She herself, it turned out, had come to the roadblock only an hour before I had, and had been pressed into service by the M.P.\u2019s, because of all the languages she knew. I asked an M.P. sergeant how old he thought she was, and he guessed, \u201cFifteen.\u201d He thought she was a boy whose voice had yet to change.\nI coaxed her into the backseat of my Mercedes and I questioned her there. I learned that she had been freed from a concentration camp in springtime, about four months before\u2014and had since eluded every agency that might have liked to help her. She should by now have been in a hospital for displaced persons. She was uninterested in ever trusting anybody with her destiny anymore. Her plan was to roam alone and out-of-doors forever, from nowhere to nowhere in a demented sort of religious ecstasy. \u201cNo one ever touches me,\u201d she said, \u201cand I never touch anyone. I am like a bird in flight. It is so beautiful. There is only God\u2014and me.\u201d\nI thought this of her: that she resembled gentle Ophelia in Hamlet, who became fey and lyrical when life was too cruel to bear. I have a copy of Hamlet at hand, and refresh my memory as to the nonsense Ophelia sang when she would no longer respond intelligently to those who asked how she was.\nThis was the song:\nHow should I your true love know\nFrom another one?\nBy his cockle hat and staff,\nAnd his sandal shoon.", 0.14270833333333333], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["breed", 0.07291666666666667], ["dr", 0.052083333333333336], ["told", 0.03125], ["sandra", 0.03125], ["things", 0.020833333333333332], ["city", 0.020833333333333332], ["ilium", 0.020833333333333332], ["hoenikker", 0.020833333333333332], ["asa", 0.020833333333333332], ["thought", 0.020833333333333332], ["night", 0.020833333333333332], ["bokonon", 0.010416666666666666], ["love", 0.010416666666666666], ["cynical", 0.010416666666666666], ["drunk", 0.010416666666666666], ["suddenly", 0.010416666666666666], ["visit", 0.010416666666666666], ["felix", 0.010416666666666666], ["people", 0.010416666666666666], ["foul", 0.010416666666666666], ["spent", 0.010416666666666666], ["sleet", 0.010416666666666666], ["civilized", 0.010416666666666666], ["catching", 0.010416666666666666], ["manner", 0.010416666666666666], ["beautifully", 0.010416666666666666], ["cat", 0.010416666666666666], ["sordid", 0.010416666666666666], ["trolley", 0.010416666666666666], ["family", 0.010416666666666666], ["burning", 0.010416666666666666], ["driving", 0.010416666666666666], ["capable", 0.010416666666666666], ["tracks", 0.010416666666666666], ["god", 0.010416666666666666], ["bristly", 0.010416666666666666], ["father", 0.010416666666666666], ["system", 0.010416666666666666], ["long", 0.010416666666666666], ["children", 0.010416666666666666], ["diseased", 0.010416666666666666], ["pretty", 0.010416666666666666], ["riding", 0.010416666666666666], ["falling", 0.010416666666666666], ["contrast", 0.010416666666666666], ["pink", 0.010416666666666666], ["serene", 0.010416666666666666], ["knew", 0.010416666666666666], ["prosperous", 0.010416666666666666], ["sir", 0.010416666666666666], ["blanket", 0.010416666666666666], ["felt", 0.010416666666666666], ["early", 0.010416666666666666], ["dressed", 0.010416666666666666], ["vaguely", 0.010416666666666666], ["worst", 0.010416666666666666], ["sedan", 0.010416666666666666], ["smog", 0.010416666666666666], ["man", 0.010416666666666666], ["town", 0.010416666666666666], ["lincoln", 0.010416666666666666], ["motionless", 0.010416666666666666], ["fur", 0.010416666666666666], ["abandoned", 0.010416666666666666], ["soul", 0.010416666666666666], ["wife", 0.010416666666666666], ["car", 0.010416666666666666], ["ill", 0.010416666666666666], ["morning", 0.010416666666666666], ["ugly", 0.010416666666666666], ["three", 0.010416666666666666], ["smoke", 0.010416666666666666], ["wheels", 0.010416666666666666], ["asked", 0.010416666666666666], ["optimistic", 0.010416666666666666]], "sentiment": ["\u201cAh, God,\u201d says Bokonon, \u201cwhat an ugly city every city is!\u201d\nSleet was falling through a motionless blanket of smog.

He would retire from the Army when the war still had a year to go, and become President of Tarkington College, now Tarkington Prison. And when I myself got out of the Army, he would hire me to teach Physics and play the bells, bells, bells.\nHere are the first words Sam Wakefield ever spoke to me, when I was 18 and he was 36:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry, Son?\u201d\n6\n\u201cWHAT\u2019S THE HURRY, Son?\u201d he said. And then, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a minute, I\u2019d like to talk to you.\u201d\nSo I stopped. That was the biggest mistake of my life. There were plenty of other exits, and I should have headed for 1 of those. At that moment, every other exit led to the University of Michigan and journalism and music-making, and a lifetime of saying and wearing what I goshdarned pleased. Any other exit, in all probability, would have led me to a wife who wouldn\u2019t go insane on me, and kids who gave me love and respect.\nAny other exit would have led to a certain amount of misery, I know, life being what it is. But I don\u2019t think it would have led me to Vietnam, and then to teaching the unteachable at Tarkington College, and then getting fired by Tarkington, and then teaching the unteachable at the penitentiary across the lake until the biggest prison break in American history. And now I myself am a prisoner.\nBut I stopped before the 1 exit blocked by Sam Wakefield. There went the ball game.\nSAM WAKEFIELD ASKED me if I had ever considered the advantages of a career in the military. This was a man who had been wounded in World War II, the 1 war I would have liked to fight in, and then in Korea. He would eventually resign from the Army with the Vietnam War still going on, and then become President of Tarkington College, and then blow his brains out.\nI said I had already been accepted by the University of Michigan and had no interest in soldiering. He wasn\u2019t having any luck at all. The sort of kid who had reached a state-level Science Fair honestly wanted to go to Cal Tech or MIT, or someplace a lot friendlier to freestyle thinking than West Point. So he was desperate.
