It was released in 1982, starring Jerry Lewis and Madeline Kahn.\nDear Steven\u2014\nI am not coming out there on March 22, as you suggested. I will not be coming out there at all. You are on your own with the movie. I have done all a writer is supposed to do, which is to give you a script. You can accept it or reject it or whatever. It isn\u2019t my duty to take part in promotional schemes, and to hang around in case rewriting is needed in a hurry and so on.\nI know of no other writer who has been required by a producer to be the endlessly cooperative and participative and public person you expect me to be. So I am saying no more than any other professional writer would say. I have done my job, all of it.\nI have other jobs I must do, and I intend to do them while you make your film. I wish you luck with it, of course. I am sorry it has to be made so quickly, and with the volatile star headed for a more glamorous enterprise immediately afterwards. I do not see how, with Scorsese waiting for him, Jerry can look upon Slapstick as anything but an interlude with possibly amusing amateurs, especially since they are willing to work so fast.\nAs I have already said, I have done all a writer is supposed to do, and largely on speculation. If you have promised more of me to your actors and investors, that was your idea, not mine. It would take ten years out of my life in the midst of making a quickie with such a potentially wild star and such a young and as yet unproven director. This is not to say that it couldn\u2019t turn out to be a wonderful movie. It is only to say that I could not stand to hang around while it was being made. Yes, we are friends, all right, but too much friendship right now could be damaging to my health.\nPlease, let us be professional. Since I have done all a writer is supposed to do, all further communications about my script should be addressed to Don Farber. Work out the money with him. I am not available for further services at any fee.\nYours truly,\nKurt Vonnegut\nApril 19, 1981", 0.13246927803379413], "title": "Letters"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["house", 0.041666666666666664], ["random", 0.041666666666666664], ["dial", 0.041666666666666664], ["press", 0.041666666666666664], ["copyright", 0.027777777777777776], ["york", 0.027777777777777776], ["masters", 0.027777777777777776], ["reserved", 0.013888888888888888], ["trademarks", 0.013888888888888888], ["1914", 0.013888888888888888], ["number", 0.013888888888888888], ["dead", 0.013888888888888888], ["macmillan", 0.013888888888888888], ["imagination", 0.013888888888888888], ["names", 0.013888888888888888], ["grateful", 0.013888888888888888], ["paperbacks", 0.013888888888888888], ["1963", 0.013888888888888888], ["trade", 0.013888888888888888], ["library", 0.013888888888888888], ["living", 0.013888888888888888], ["resemblance", 0.013888888888888888], ["acknowledgment", 0.013888888888888888], ["author", 0.013888888888888888], ["1942", 0.013888888888888888], ["trademark", 0.013888888888888888], ["fiction", 0.013888888888888888], ["knowlt", 0.013888888888888888], ["card", 0.013888888888888888], ["vonnegut", 0.013888888888888888], ["events", 0.013888888888888888], ["coincidental", 0.013888888888888888], ["division", 0.013888888888888888], ["product", 0.013888888888888888], ["lee", 0.013888888888888888], ["congress", 0.013888888888888888], ["permission", 0.013888888888888888], ["registered", 0.013888888888888888], ["jr", 0.013888888888888888], ["persons", 0.013888888888888888], ["spoon", 0.013888888888888888], ["characters", 0.013888888888888888], ["reprint", 0.013888888888888888], ["1915", 0.013888888888888888], ["kurt", 0.013888888888888888], ["locales", 0.013888888888888888], ["76154035", 0.013888888888888888], ["fictitiously", 0.013888888888888888], ["actual", 0.013888888888888888], ["anthology", 0.013888888888888888], ["places", 0.013888888888888888], ["rights", 0.013888888888888888], ["work", 0.013888888888888888], ["catalog", 0.013888888888888888], ["edgar", 0.013888888888888888], ["incidents", 0.013888888888888888], ["colophon", 0.013888888888888888], ["published", 0.013888888888888888], ["entirely", 0.013888888888888888], ["river", 0.013888888888888888], ["hoheimer", 0.013888888888888888]], "sentiment": ["Published by\nThe Dial Press\nA Division of Random House, Inc.\nNew York, New York\nThis is a work of fiction.

Childhood lingered in his features, but when he paused to rest, his fingers went hopefully to the silky beginnings of sideburns and a mustache.
