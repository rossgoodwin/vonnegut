Will it never stop? Specialists whose paradigms are threatened by a new idea behave unscientifically, taking each other\u2019s word that the idea is noise, assuming that one of them may actually have looked into it.\nYou are, of course, an obvious nut case, writer of crank letters about methadone and heart disease. The unread last paragraphs no doubt deal with the electrification of thunderstorms and flying saucers. The writer is surely a patient and not a physician at Bellevue.\nYou remind me of the nut who thought childbed fever in hospitals could be reduced if physicians and nurses would wash their hands before visiting the maternity ward.\nCheers\u2014", 0.0958041958041958], "title": "Letters"}}
