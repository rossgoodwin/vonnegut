I am not kidding: that little piece in the Alumni News will do more to firm up my reputation than anything that has been printed about me so far.\nI am extremely dense, and so continue to be startled whenever I realize that you aren\u2019t a cynical bastard at all. Since I now have it in my head momentarily that you are a sentimentalist, I will tell you that I have a son entering Swarthmore next fall, and that he is the age I was when you and I first met. I will give him your name and address, and tell him to call you in the expectation of making a powerful new friend. He is a tough little bastard, a 145-pound line-backer from Mount Hermon, who is blind as a bat without his glasses. His name is Mark, and I like him, and he\u2019s very good at math and radical chess.\nSince you advised me so well at the start of my career, I\u2019ll ask you to do it again at the end of it: Should I become a resident writer at the University of Iowa? I got offered the job yesterday. They would pay me a grand a month, have me teach about five hours a week, and write the rest of the time. I guess maybe it\u2019s a good idea, because I\u2019d do just as much writing as I do now, and get $8,500 I wouldn\u2019t get otherwise. How\u2019s that for using the old head?\nListen: I think you can safely become Salinger now.

took a hand from his muff, touched a stove. It was as cold as ice. The stage was still set for Cinderella. Azure curtains hung from arches which were shocking pink. There were golden thrones and the dummy clock, whose hands were set at midnight. Cinderella\u2019s slippers, which were airman\u2019s boots painted silver, were capsized side by side under a golden throne.\nBilly and poor old Edgar Derby and Lazzaro had been in the hospital when the British passed out blankets and mattresses, so they had none. They had to improvise. The only space open to them was up on the stage, and they went up there, pulled the azure curtains down, made nests.\nBilly, curled in his azure nest, found himself staring at Cinderella\u2019s silver boots under a throne. And then he remembered that his shoes were ruined, that he needed boots. He hated to get out of his nest, but he forced himself to do it. He crawled to the boots on all fours, sat, tried them on.\nThe boots fit perfectly. Billy Pilgrim was Cinderella, and Cinderella was Billy Pilgrim.\nSomewhere in there was a lecture on personal hygiene by the head Englishman, and then a free election. At least half the Americans went on snoozing through it all. The Englishman got up on the stage, and he rapped on the arm of a throne with a swagger stick, called, \u201cLads, lads, lads\u2014can I have your attention, please?\u201d And so on.\nWhat the Englishman said about survival was this: \u201cIf you stop taking pride in your appearance, you will very soon die.\u201d He said that he had seen several men die in the following way: \u201cThey ceased to stand up straight, then ceased to shave or wash, then ceased to get out of bed, then ceased to talk, then died. There is this much to be said for it: it is evidently a very easy and painless way to go.\u201d So it goes.\nThe Englishman said that he, when captured, had made and kept the following vows to himself: To brush his teeth twice a day, to shave once a day, to wash his face and hands before every meal and after going to the latrine, to polish his shoes once a day, to exercise for at least half an hour each morning and then move his bowels, and to look into a mirror frequently, frankly evaluating his appearance, particularly with respect to posture.\nBilly Pilgrim heard all this while lying in his nest. He looked not at the Englishman\u2019s face but his ankles.\n\u201cI envy you lads,\u201d said the Englishman.", -0.03621527777777779], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["unk", 0.07476635514018691], ["writer", 0.037383177570093455], ["pain", 0.037383177570093455], ["gained", 0.028037383177570093], ["life", 0.018691588785046728], ["gossip", 0.018691588785046728], ["philosophy", 0.018691588785046728], ["supposed", 0.018691588785046728], ["understanding", 0.018691588785046728], ["letter", 0.018691588785046728], ["drunk", 0.018691588785046728], ["mixed", 0.018691588785046728], ["remembering", 0.009345794392523364], ["identical", 0.009345794392523364], ["harm", 0.009345794392523364], ["letters", 0.009345794392523364], ["people", 0.009345794392523364], ["feel", 0.009345794392523364], ["tearfully", 0.009345794392523364], ["fish", 0.009345794392523364], ["random", 0.009345794392523364], ["wishing", 0.009345794392523364], ["general", 0.009345794392523364], ["boaz", 0.009345794392523364], ["examples", 0.009345794392523364], ["wished", 0.009345794392523364], ["theology", 0.009345794392523364], ["quality", 0.009345794392523364], ["time", 0.009345794392523364], ["speak", 0.009345794392523364], ["medicine", 0.009345794392523364], ["story", 0.009345794392523364], ["astronomy", 0.009345794392523364], ["psychology", 0.009345794392523364], ["dying", 0.009345794392523364], ["hospital", 0.009345794392523364], ["contained", 0.009345794392523364], ["officers", 0.009345794392523364], ["uncritically", 0.009345794392523364], ["heroism", 0.009345794392523364], ["slammed", 0.009345794392523364], ["pains", 0.009345794392523364], ["big", 0.009345794392523364], ["biology", 0.009345794392523364], ["tie", 0.009345794392523364], ["borders", 0.009345794392523364], ["geography", 0.009345794392523364], ["wolfed", 0.009345794392523364], ["poor", 0.009345794392523364], ["case", 0.009345794392523364], ["eyes", 0.009345794392523364], ["felt", 0.009345794392523364], ["risk", 0.009345794392523364], ["stay", 0.009345794392523364], ["gulped", 0.009345794392523364], ["regard", 0.009345794392523364], ["twinge", 0.009345794392523364], ["tied", 0.009345794392523364], ["barrack", 0.009345794392523364], ["address", 0.009345794392523364], ["accepting", 0.009345794392523364], ["trouble", 0.009345794392523364], ["accepted", 0.009345794392523364], ["shoelaces", 0.009345794392523364], ["riverbank", 0.009345794392523364], ["man", 0.009345794392523364], ["sample", 0.009345794392523364], ["short", 0.009345794392523364], ["battalion", 0.009345794392523364], ["wondered", 0.009345794392523364], ["excruciating", 0.009345794392523364], ["die", 0.009345794392523364], ["sobbed", 0.009345794392523364], ["unhappy", 0.009345794392523364], ["watered", 0.009345794392523364], ["air", 0.009345794392523364], ["will", 0.009345794392523364], ["sensitive", 0.009345794392523364], ["stand", 0.009345794392523364], ["22", 0.009345794392523364], ["judging", 0.009345794392523364], ["hungrily", 0.009345794392523364], ["avoid", 0.009345794392523364], ["history", 0.009345794392523364]], "sentiment": ["Even the little sample twinge they had given him in the hospital had been excruciating.

opposition, in case they had a tendency to become dominant. The Captain would never hear about that, and neither would anybody else on Santa Rosalia. And I am speaking only of the dominance of large life forms over other large life forms. Truth be told, the planet\u2019s most victorious organisms have always been microscopic. In all the encounters between Davids and Goliaths, was there ever a time when a Goliath won?\nOn the level of the big creatures, then, the visible strugglers, lobsters were surely poor candidates for becoming as elaborately constructive and destructive as humankind. If the Captain had told his mordant fable about octopi instead of lobsters, though, it might not have been quite so ridiculous. Back then, as now, those squishy creatures had highly developed brains, whose basic function was to control their versatile arms. Their situation, one might think, wasn\u2019t all that different from that of human beings, with hands to control. Presumably, their brains could do other things with their arms and brains than catch fish.\nBut I have yet to see an octopus, or any sort of animal, for that matter, which wasn\u2019t entirely content to pass its time on earth as a food gatherer, to shun the experiments with unlimited greed and ambition performed by humankind.\nAs for human beings making a comeback, of starting to use tools and build houses and play musical instruments and so on again: They would have to do it with their beaks this time. Their arms have become flippers in which the hand bones are almost entirely imprisoned and immobilized. Each flipper is studded with five purely ornamental nubbins, attractive to members of the opposite sex at mating time. These are in fact the tips of four suppressed fingers and a thumb. Those parts of people\u2019s brains which used to control their hands, moreover, simply don\u2019t exist anymore, and human skulls are now much more streamlined on that account. The more streamlined the skull, the more successful the fisher person.\nIf people can swim as fast and far as fur seals now, what is to prevent their swimming all the way back to the mainland, whence their ancestors came? Answer: nothing.\nPlenty have tried it or will try it during periods of fish shortages or overpopulation. But the bacterium which eats human eggs is always there to greet them.\nSo much for exploration.\nThen again, it is so peaceful here, why would anybody want to live on the mainland? Every island has become an ideal place to raise children, with waving coconut palms and broad white beaches\u2014and limpid blue lagoons.\nAnd all the people are so innocent and relaxed now, all because evolution took their hands away.\nQuoth Mandarax:", 0.12065335027291552], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["war", 0.028037383177570093], ["hugged", 0.018691588785046728], ["translated", 0.018691588785046728], ["pictures", 0.018691588785046728], ["respect", 0.018691588785046728], ["picture", 0.018691588785046728], ["foyer", 0.018691588785046728], ["consider", 0.009345794392523364], ["chromos", 0.009345794392523364], ["playtime", 0.009345794392523364], ["children", 0.009345794392523364], ["happiness", 0.009345794392523364], ["death", 0.009345794392523364], ["20", 0.009345794392523364], ["day", 0.009345794392523364], ["better", 0.009345794392523364], ["tears", 0.009345794392523364], ["fool", 0.009345794392523364], ["starving", 0.009345794392523364], ["hit", 0.009345794392523364], ["dan", 0.009345794392523364], ["expressionism", 0.009345794392523364], ["import", 0.009345794392523364], ["bringing", 0.009345794392523364], ["learned", 0.009345794392523364], ["entertaining", 0.009345794392523364], ["lose", 0.009345794392523364], ["shaking", 0.009345794392523364], ["square", 0.009345794392523364], ["art", 0.009345794392523364], ["house", 0.009345794392523364], ["artists", 0.009345794392523364], ["farewell", 0.009345794392523364], ["driveway", 0.009345794392523364], ["close", 0.009345794392523364], ["girl", 0.009345794392523364], ["lots", 0.009345794392523364], ["find", 0.009345794392523364], ["appreciative", 0.009345794392523364], ["state", 0.009345794392523364], ["apologized", 0.009345794392523364], ["lecture", 0.009345794392523364], ["burned", 0.009345794392523364], ["contrast", 0.009345794392523364], ["trashy", 0.009345794392523364], ["gathered", 0.009345794392523364], ["predicting", 0.009345794392523364], ["commercial", 0.009345794392523364], ["understanding", 0.009345794392523364], ["job", 0.009345794392523364], ["affectionately", 0.009345794392523364], ["interfere", 0.009345794392523364], ["leaving", 0.009345794392523364], ["thing", 0.009345794392523364], ["gregory", 0.009345794392523364], ["asked", 0.009345794392523364], ["comment", 0.009345794392523364], ["marilee", 0.009345794392523364], ["cancer", 0.009345794392523364], ["explained", 0.009345794392523364], ["errands", 0.009345794392523364], ["awaited", 0.009345794392523364], ["walk", 0.009345794392523364], ["embarrassed", 0.009345794392523364], ["ussr", 0.009345794392523364], ["guests", 0.009345794392523364], ["wasn", 0.009345794392523364], ["heads", 0.009345794392523364], ["three", 0.009345794392523364], ["beskudnikov", 0.009345794392523364], ["lot", 0.009345794392523364], ["sophisticated", 0.009345794392523364], ["ardently", 0.009345794392523364], ["true", 0.009345794392523364], ["town", 0.009345794392523364], ["room", 0.009345794392523364], ["grinning", 0.009345794392523364], ["unanimous", 0.009345794392523364], ["called", 0.009345794392523364], ["beautiful", 0.009345794392523364], ["proved", 0.009345794392523364], ["abstract", 0.009345794392523364], ["horrors", 0.009345794392523364], ["dozen", 0.009345794392523364], ["terribly", 0.009345794392523364], ["agreeing", 0.009345794392523364], ["bewailing", 0.009345794392523364], ["department", 0.009345794392523364], ["bid", 0.009345794392523364], ["mock", 0.009345794392523364], ["pain", 0.009345794392523364], ["effusively", 0.009345794392523364], ["dime", 0.009345794392523364], ["knew", 0.009345794392523364], ["visitors", 0.009345794392523364], ["meals", 0.009345794392523364], ["man", 0.009345794392523364], ["berman", 0.009345794392523364], ["painting", 0.009345794392523364]], "sentiment": ["They made no comment on the foyer when they came in, and proved to be sophisticated and appreciative with respect to Abstract Expressionism, quite a contrast with many other guests from the USSR. As they were leaving, though, they had to ask me why I had such trashy pictures in the foyer.\nSo I gave them Mrs. Berman\u2019s lecture on the horrors which awaited these children, bringing them close to tears. They were terribly embarrassed. They apologized effusively for not understanding the true import of the chromos, and said that, now that I had explained them, they were unanimous in agreeing that these were the most important pictures in the house. And then they went from picture to picture, bewailing all the pain each girl would go through. Most of this wasn\u2019t translated, but I gathered that they were predicting cancer and war and so on.\nI was quite a hit, and was hugged and hugged.\nNever before had visitors bid me farewell so ardently! Usually they can hardly think of anything to say.\nAnd they called something to me from the driveway, grinning affectionately and shaking their heads. So I asked the man from the State Department what they had said, and he translated: \u201cNo more war, no more war.\n20\nBACK TO THE PAST:\nWhen Dan Gregory burned up my painting, why didn\u2019t I do to him what he had done to Beskudnikov? Why didn\u2019t I mock him and walk out and find a better job? For one thing, I had learned a lot about the commercial art world by then, and knew that artists like me were a dime a dozen and all starving to death.\nConsider all I had to lose: a room of my own, three square meals a day, entertaining errands to run all over town, and lots of playtime with the beautiful Marilee.\nWhat a fool I would have been to let self-respect interfere with my happiness!",

Now Ruth caught the stench of the dirty man\u2019s breath, brought to her nostrils by a sudden gust from the door. The cough worsened, tearing the breath from him. The cigarette dropped.\nRuth twisted around on the bench so that her gaze wouldn\u2019t naturally fall on him. A winded fat man, his red face determinedly cheerful beneath a homburg, begged to be let in at the first of the ticket line: salesman \u2026 ball bearings or boilers or something like that \u2026\nAgain the agonized coughing.

What a reaper and binder life can be sometimes!\nWhen Leland Clewes, on the other side of Fifth Avenue, realized who I was, he formed his mouth into a perfect \u201cO.\u201d I could not hear his saying \u201cOh,\u201d but I could see his saying \u201cOh.\u201d He was making fun of our encounter after all these years, overacting his surprise and dismay like an actor in a silent movie.\nPlainly, he was going to come back across the street as soon as the lights changed. Meanwhile, all those fake Hindu imbeciles in saffron robes continued to chant and dance behind him.\nThere was still time for me to flee. What made me hold my ground, I think, was this: the need to prove myself a gentleman. During the bad old days, when I had testified against him, people who wrote about us, speculating as to who was telling the truth and who was not, concluded for the most part that he was a real gentleman, descended from a long line of gentlemen, and that I was a person of Slavic background only pretending to be a gentleman. Honor and bravery and truthfulness, then, would mean everything to him and very little to me.\nOther contrasts were pointed out, certainly. With every new edition of the papers and newsmagazines, seemingly, I became shorter and he became taller. My poor wife became more gross and foreign, and his wife became more of an American golden girl. His friends became more numerous and respectable, and mine couldn\u2019t even be found under damp rocks anymore. But what troubled me most in my very bones was the idea that he was honorable and I was not.

I did see, right in front of Hazel and H. Lowe Crosby, a horse-faced woman with platinum blonde hair, a woman new to the passenger list. Next to hers was a seat that appeared to be empty, a seat that might well have sheltered a midget without my seeing even the top of his head.\nBut it was San Lorenzo\u2014the land, the history, the people\u2014that intrigued me then, so I looked no harder for the midget.

Shakespeare has been quoted twice so far. It so happens that I can quote him, too. I have always been bad at memorizing, but I had an English teacher in high school who insisted that everyone in her class know his most famous lines by heart. I never expected to speak them as being meaningful to me in real life, but now\u2019s the time.

Why overdo? It was certainly enough for the occasion, raising as it did the specter of having yet another Vietnam veteran on the faculty killing himself on school property.\nI fished the key to the bell tower from my pocket and threw it into the middle of the circular table. The table was so big that somebody was going to have to climb up on it to retrieve the key, or maybe find a long stick somewhere.\n\u201cGood luck with the bells,\u201d I said.

There, in the midst of a mob of every imaginable sort of refugee, the blond was showing them a small pistol, as though they could have that, too, along with the watch.\nBut it was now impossible for anybody to say any more funny stuff and still be heard. The earth shook, and the air was ripped to shreds as armored vehicles from the victorious Soviet Union, thundering and backfiring, came up the road.
