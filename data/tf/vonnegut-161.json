He forgave me, of course. He forgives everybody for everything.

degenerated into panting laughter. There was a clatter in Paul\u2019s receiver, a cry, a click, and then the dial tone.\nPaul restored the receiver to its cradle with a limp hand. There was no quitting before the Meadows, he told himself glumly\u2014no re-educating Anita and quitting in the few days remaining. The Meadows would have to be endured, and, worse luck, he would have to endure it as captain of the Blue Team.\nHis glance passed over the hairy tan chest, frank gray eyes, and keg-sized biceps of the man on the book jacket, and his thoughts slid easily, gratefully, into the fantasy of the new, good life ahead of him. Somewhere, outside of society, there was a place for a man\u2014a man and wife\u2014to live heartily and blamelessly, naturally, by hands and wits.\nPaul studied his long, soft hands. Their only callus was on the large finger of his right hand. There, stained a dirty orange by cigarette tars, a tough hump had grown over the years, protecting his finger against the attrition of pen and pencil shafts. Skills\u2014that was what the hands of the heroes in the novels had, skills. To date, Paul\u2019s hands had learned to do little save grip a pen, pencil, toothbrush, hair brush, razor, knife, fork, spoon, cup, glass, faucet, doorknob, switch, handkerchief, towel, zipper, button, snap, bar of soap, book, comb, wife, or steering wheel.\nHe recalled his college days, and was sure he\u2019d learned some sort of manual skill there. He\u2019d learned to make mechanical drawings. That was when the lump on his finger had begun to grow. What else? He\u2019d learned to bounce a ball off several walls with skill, and to the consternation of most of his squash opponents. He\u2019d been good enough to make the quarter-finals of the Regional Collegiate Squash Tournament two years in a row. He used to be able to do that with his hands.\nWhat else?\nAgain uneasiness crept up on him\u2014the fear that there was far too little of him to get along anywhere outside the system, to get along at all contentedly. He might go into some small business, such as the one he claimed to be in when he didn\u2019t want to be recognized\u2014wholesale groceries. But he would still be caught in the mesh of the economy and its concomitant hierarchy. The machines wouldn\u2019t let him into that business, anyway, and even if they would, there\u2019d be no less nonsense and posturing. Moreover, despite the fact that Paul was saying to hell with the whole system, he was aware that the relatively unskilled and dull business of buying and selling was beneath him. So to hell with it. The only thing worse would be complete idleness, which Paul could afford, but which, he was sure, was as amoral as what he was quitting.\nFarming\u2014now there was a magic word. Like so many words with little magic from the past still clinging to them, the word \u201cfarming\u201d was a reminder of what rugged stock the present generation had come from, of how tough a thing a human being could be if he had to. The word had little meaning in the present. There were no longer farmers, but only agricultural engineers. In the rich Iroquois Valley in Ilium County, thousands of settlers had once made their living from the soil. Now Doctor Ormand van Curler managed the farming of the whole county with a hundred men and several million dollars\u2019 worth of machinery.\nFarming. Paul\u2019s pulse quickened, and he daydreamed of living a century before\u2014living in one of the many farm-houses now crumbling into their foundations over the valley. He chose one farmhouse in particular for his fantasy, one close to the edge of town that he\u2019d often admired.

He was nice and clean, since Akiko bathed him every day, and shampooed and combed his beard and hair. The soap she used, which was made by the Kanka-bono women, was composed of ground-up bones and penguin fat.\nOne of the exasperating things about the *Captain\u2019s disease was that his body was still perfectly capable of taking care of itself. It was a lot stronger than *Mary\u2019s. It was his deteriorating big brain which was having him spend so much time in bed, and allowing him to soil himself and refuse to eat and so on.\nAgain: His condition wasn\u2019t peculiar to Santa Rosalia. Back on the mainland, millions of old people were as helpless as babies, and compassionate young adults like Akiko had to look after them. Thanks to sharks and killer whales, problems connected with aging are unimaginable in the present day.\n\u201cWho is this hag?\u201d the *Captain asked Akiko. \u201cI hate ugly women. This is the ugliest woman I ever saw.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s *Mary Hepburn\u2014it\u2019s Mrs. Flemming, Grandpa,\u201d said Akiko. A tear skittered down her furry cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s Grandma,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNever saw her before in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease get her out of here. I will close my eyes. When I open them again, I want her gone.\u201d He closed his eyes, and began counting out loud under his breath.\nAkiko came over to *Mary and gripped her frail right arm. \u201cOh, Grandma\u2014\u201d she said, \u201cI had no idea he would be like this.\u201d\nAnd *Mary said to her loudly, \u201cHe\u2019s no worse than he ever was.\u201d\nThe *Captain went on counting.\nFrom the neighborhood of the spring, half a kilometer distant, came a male cry of triumph and peals of female laughter. The male cry was a familiar one on the island. It was Kamikaze\u2019s customary announcement to one and all that he had caught a female of some sort, and that they were about to copulate. He was nineteen then, barely past his sexual prime, and, as the only virile male then on the island, was likely to copulate with anybody or anything at any time. This was another sorrow Akiko had to bear\u2014the blatant infidelities of her mate.

I have never been famous for thinking far ahead. But I said, \u201cNo.\u201d I formulated a new scheme, which was to put them into the potato barn, but I didn\u2019t say so. I hadn\u2019t had the nerve to tell her I had rented a potato barn. But she\u2019d found out about it someway. She would find out someway, too, that I had bought myself and Painters X, Y and Z and Kitchen tailor-made suits of the finest materials and workmanship the night before.\n\u201cPut them in the potato barn,\u201d she said, \u201cand bury them under potatoes. Potatoes we can always use.\u201d\nThat truck should have been an armored car in a convoy of state police, considering what some of the paintings in there are worth today. I myself considered them valuable, but certainly not that valuable. So I could not bring myself to put them in the barn, which was then a musty place, having been home for so long for nothing but potatoes and the earth and bacteria and fungi which so loved to cling to them.\nSo I rented a dry, clean space under lock and key at Home Sweet Home Moving and Storage out here instead. The rental over the years would absorb a major part of my income. Nor did I overcome my habit of helping painter pals in trouble with whatever cash I had or could lay my hands on, and accepting pictures in return. At least Dorothy did not have to look at the detritus of this habit. Every painting which settled a debt in full went straight from the needy painter\u2019s studio to Home Sweet Home.\nHer parting words to Kitchen and me when we at last got the pictures out of the apartment were these: \u201cOne thing I like about the Hamptons: every so often you see a sign that says \u2018Town Dump.\u2019\u201d\nIf Kitchen had been a perfect Fred Jones to my Dan Gregory, he would have driven the truck. But he was very much the passenger, and I was the chauffeur. He had grown up with chauffeurs, so he didn\u2019t think twice when he got in on the passenger side.\nI talked about my marriage and the war and the Great Depression, and about how much older Kitchen and I both were, compared with the typical returning veteran. \u201cI should have started a family and settled down years ago,\u201d I said. \u201cBut how could I have done that when I was the right age to do it? What women did I know anyway?\u201d\n\u201cAll the returning veterans in the movies are our age or older,\u201d he said. That was true. In the movies you seldom saw the babies who had done most of the heavy fighting on the ground in the war.\n\u201cYes\u2014\u201d I said, \u201cand most of the actors in the movies never even went to war. They came home to the wife and kids and swimming pool after every grueling day in front of the cameras, after firing off blank cartridges while men all around them were spitting catsup.\u201d", 0.19275759830447325], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["lowell", 0.06862745098039216], ["people", 0.029411764705882353], ["madelaine", 0.029411764705882353], ["hide", 0.0196078431372549], ["beer", 0.0196078431372549], ["bonanza", 0.0196078431372549], ["summer", 0.00980392156862745], ["taller", 0.00980392156862745], ["sentence", 0.00980392156862745], ["pointed", 0.00980392156862745], ["discovered", 0.00980392156862745], ["cries", 0.00980392156862745], ["earth", 0.00980392156862745], ["magnifying", 0.00980392156862745], ["sampled", 0.00980392156862745], ["unfinished", 0.00980392156862745], ["window", 0.00980392156862745], ["lip", 0.00980392156862745], ["evening", 0.00980392156862745], ["returned", 0.00980392156862745], ["listened", 0.00980392156862745], ["watching", 0.00980392156862745], ["laughed", 0.00980392156862745], ["courage", 0.00980392156862745], ["kiss", 0.00980392156862745], ["hearing", 0.00980392156862745], ["drop", 0.00980392156862745], ["facing", 0.00980392156862745], ["piping", 0.00980392156862745], ["common", 0.00980392156862745], ["ogling", 0.00980392156862745], ["guy", 0.00980392156862745], ["lifted", 0.00980392156862745], ["acquired", 0.00980392156862745], ["idea", 0.00980392156862745], ["ardent", 0.00980392156862745], ["absurdity", 0.00980392156862745], ["saucer", 0.00980392156862745], ["distaste", 0.00980392156862745], ["squared", 0.00980392156862745], ["kneeling", 0.00980392156862745], ["appreciative", 0.00980392156862745], ["attentively", 0.00980392156862745], ["filled", 0.00980392156862745], ["dirt", 0.00980392156862745], ["dabs", 0.00980392156862745], ["boss", 0.00980392156862745], ["smacking", 0.00980392156862745], ["chanting", 0.00980392156862745], ["shriek", 0.00980392156862745], ["supplicating", 0.00980392156862745], ["chant", 0.00980392156862745], ["dinner", 0.00980392156862745], ["faces", 0.00980392156862745], ["amber", 0.00980392156862745], ["sweet", 0.00980392156862745], ["guests", 0.00980392156862745], ["delicious", 0.00980392156862745], ["gratitude", 0.00980392156862745], ["spoke", 0.00980392156862745], ["faint", 0.00980392156862745], ["hey", 0.00980392156862745], ["exploring", 0.00980392156862745], ["happily", 0.00980392156862745], ["glass", 0.00980392156862745], ["understand", 0.00980392156862745], ["stairs", 0.00980392156862745], ["car", 0.00980392156862745], ["air", 0.00980392156862745], ["learn", 0.00980392156862745], ["voice", 0.00980392156862745], ["minutes", 0.00980392156862745], ["history", 0.00980392156862745], ["dutifully", 0.00980392156862745], ["smorgasbord", 0.00980392156862745], ["taste", 0.00980392156862745], ["mind", 0.00980392156862745], ["watched", 0.00980392156862745], ["floating", 0.00980392156862745], ["beaming", 0.00980392156862745], ["adoring", 0.00980392156862745], ["largest", 0.00980392156862745], ["ordinary", 0.00980392156862745], ["delight", 0.00980392156862745], ["coming", 0.00980392156862745], ["died", 0.00980392156862745], ["failing", 0.00980392156862745], ["pulled", 0.00980392156862745], ["notion", 0.00980392156862745]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI give you,\u201d he said, \u201cthe largest smorgasbord in history.\u201d The dabs were all taller than the dinner guests.\nAfter several minutes, the little people got courage enough to begin exploring again.

["\u201cMark has taught me never to romanticize mental illness, never to imagine a brilliant and beguiling schizophrenic who makes more sense about life than his or her doctor or even the president of Harvard University. Mark says that schizophrenia is as ghastly and debilitating as smallpox or rabies or any other unspeakable disease you care to name. Society cannot be blamed, and neither, thank God, can the friends and relatives of the patient. Schizophrenia is an internal chemical catastrophe. It is a case of monstrously bad genetic luck, bad luck of a sort encountered in absolutely every sort of society\u2014including the Australian aborigines and the middle class of Vienna, Austria, before the Second World War.\n\u201cPlenty of other writers at this very moment are writing a story about an admirable, perhaps even a divine schizophrenic. Why? Because the story is wildly applauded every time it is told. It blames the culture and the economy and the society and everything but the disease itself for making the patient unwell. Mark says that is wrong.\n\u201cAs his father, though, I am still free to say this, I think: I believe that a culture, a combination of ideas and artifacts, can sometimes make a healthy person behave against his or her best interests, and against the best interests of the society and the planet, too.\n\u201cI have made up a story about that for this moment, and for this audience in this motel. It goes like this:\n\u201cThere is this psychiatrist, you see. He is a colonel in the German SS in Poland during World War Two. His name is Vonnegut. That is a good German name. Colonel Vonnegut is supposed to look after the mental health of SS people in his area, which includes the uniformed staff at Auschwitz.\n\u201cColonel Vonnegut has a skull and crossbones on his hat. Ordinarily, when an SS man wants to express his love for a woman, he gives her a skull and crossbones to wear. But Colonel Vonnegut is in love with an SS woman, and she already has skulls and crossbones of her own. So he sends her candy instead.\n\u201cBut that is not the major crisis in the story. The most moving part is when a young, idealistic SS lieutenant comes to Vonnegut for help. His name is Dampfwalze. Dampjwalze means \u2019steamroller.\u2019 Vonnegut means nothing. Ask any critic on The New York Review of Books.\n\u201cLieutenant Dampfwalze, who could be played by Peter O\u2019Toole, feels that he can\u2019t cut the mustard anymore on the railroad platform at Auschwitz, where boxcars of people are unloaded day after day. He is sick and tired of it, but he has the wisdom to seek professional help. Dr. Vonnegut is an eclectic worker in the field of mental health, incidentally, a pragmatic man. He is a little bit Jungian, a little bit Freudian, a little bit Rankian\u2014and so on. He has an open and inquiring mind.\n\u201cActually, he cures Dampfwalze with megavitamins, the same things that cured my son.

He himself would be shot dead with buckshot and slugs after the prison break, while carrying a flag of truce, by Whitey VanArsdale, the mechanic, and Lyle Hooper, the Fire Chief.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said to him, \u201cbut may I ask what you are reading?\u201d\nHe displayed the book\u2019s cover so I could read it for myself. The title was The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\nCough.\nAbdullah was summoned to the Warden\u2019s Office, incidentally, because he was 1 of several persons, guards as well as convicts, who claimed to have seen a castle flying over the prison. The Warden wanted to find out if some new hallucinatory drug had been smuggled in, or whether the whole place was finally going insane, or what on Earth was happening.\nTHE PROTOCOLS OF the Elders of Zion was an anti-Semitic work first published in Russia about 100 years ago. It purported to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jews from many countries who planned to cooperate internationally so as to cause wars and revolutions and financial busts and so on, which would leave them owning everything. Its title was parodied by the author of the story in Black Garterbelt, and its paranoia, too.\nThe great American inventor and industrialist Henry Ford thought it was a genuine document. He had it published in this country back when my father was a boy. Now here was a black convict in irons, who had the gift of literacy, who was taking it seriously. It would turn out that there were 100s of copies circulating in the prison, printed in Libya and passed out by the ruling gang at Athena, the Black Brothers of Islam.\nTHAT SUMMER I would start a literacy program in the prison, using people like Abdullah Akbahr as proselytizers for reading and writing, going from cell to cell and offering lessons. Thanks to me, 1,000s of former illiterates would be able to read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion by the time of the prison break.\nI denounced that book, but couldn\u2019t keep it from circulating.

Otherwise, Felix\u2019s sobbing could have wrecked the funeral. Mother and I gave up on going to the burial. We had no thought but to get Felix out of the church and into the County Hospital. It was all we could do not to get out ahead of the casket.\nWe had come late, so we were parked fairly far out on the parking lot, and there were a number of neighborhood children paying their respects to the Rolls-Royce. They had never seen one before, I\u2019m sure, but they knew what it was. They were so reverent, that they might have been attending an open-casket funeral right there in the parking lot.\nCelia Hoover\u2019s casket, by the way, was closed. That must have been because of the Drno.\nWe got Felix into the back seat without any trouble. He sat there with the top down, sobbing away. I think we could have sent him up a tree, and he would have been up among the branches and birds\u2019 nests, sobbing away.\nBut he wouldn\u2019t give us the keys.
