At a dinner in my honor in Moscow, she was saluted by her colleagues as being unquestionably the finest translator in the Soviet Union.\nShe is approaching eighty, and I wish her to see the United States, whose literature she has served so well, before she dies.\nThe authorities in the Soviet Union, for reasons unknown to me, have been reluctant to let her travel outside the country. They are sending four translators here next spring, but Mrs. Rait is not among them.\nSo I am now attempting to put mild pressure on those authorities to let her come here. An invitation from me to her, person to person, has proved futile in the past, and would prove to be futile again. The best advice I have from our State Department and from friends in the Soviet Union is that an invitation must come from an educational institution in order to be considered seriously.\nYour university has kindly and wisely, in my opinion, agreed to issue the invitation.\nFor my part, I have offered my services as a participant in seminars and as a companion to Mrs. Rait and whatever, free of charge.\nI have, moreover, given the University a cashier\u2019s check for three thousand dollars ($3000.00), guaranteeing that the University will have none of its own funds at risk in this enterprise.\nIf Mrs. Rait is unable to come to America, then that check will be returned to me.\nNow then: If Mrs. Rait comes, it will be an event of tremendous importance not just for me, but for the country, the University, and for literary people everywhere.
