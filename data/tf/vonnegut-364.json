Yes, and you and Joe Petro are now members of a sweet and very odd little gang which growed like Topsy, previously consisting only of Marc Leeds, Peter Reed, and Asa Pieratt. Our motto, I think, should be the Mad Hatter\u2019s \u201cNo room! No room!\u201d\nAs for the wonderful art Joe and I made and gave to Midway: It was obviously a pipe dream that it could be sold easily. Business is business, unfortunately. Ollie wants my publicity person to get the word out in national news outlets that the pictures are available and wonderful, but I don\u2019t have a publicity person. It\u2019s just me, Lord, standing in the name of prayer. Whatever the college wants to do with the huge remainder is OK with me. Maybe anybody who donates $250 to Midway could take the tax deduction and a picture, too. Whatever.\nCheers,\nKurt Vonnegut", 0.19338068181818183], "title": "Letters"}}
