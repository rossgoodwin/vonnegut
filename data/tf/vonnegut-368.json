Whenever I meet a Swede, I ask how you are. They all know who you are and think well of you.\nThat\u2019s pleasant news that you think I\u2019m a good writer, but I\u2019m pretty much out of steam now, having turned 72. Most American male writers have done their best work by the time they\u2019re 55, for whatever reason. I was delighted to hear recently that Brahms was sick of composing by the time he was 54, and wrote just one short piece for a remarkable clarinetist after that. My architect father was sick of architecture by the time he was 55, and that seemed reasonable and honorable to me. He died 19 [sic] years later, at 72, having turned to making pottery.\nI myself have taken to making silk screen prints, painting on acetate with india ink or pens loaded with opaque silver paint. It\u2019s a way to cover a lot of space in a hurry. Using language, I\u2019m lucky if I can cover a page in a day.\nActually, I do work some every day on a book promised long ago, with the working title \u201cTimequake.\u201d It has such a wonderful premise, though, that I haven\u2019t been intelligent enough to do it justice, so far. I don\u2019t want my final book to be a piece of crap. At the end of his life, Mark Twain was writing mostly crap.\nCheers,\nKurt Vonnegut\nJanuary 14, 1995\nNew York City\nTO DAVID MARKSON\nWilfrid Sheed was a novelist, biographer, and reviewer of books and movies for journals including The New York Review of Books and Esquire.
