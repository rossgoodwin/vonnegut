test drive with the prospective customer in the passenger seat. I tried to tell him not to go around corners so fast, especially if the customers were middle-aged or older, but he thought it was the best way to explain front-wheel drive. Some of them were shaken and green. He didn\u2019t sell a lot of cars. \u2018Maybe you should just let them drive,\u2019 I suggested.\u2026 I\u2019ll always remember my father as the world\u2019s worst car salesman who couldn\u2019t get a job teaching English at Cape Cod Community College.\u201d He did get a job teaching at a school for disturbed teenagers and writing copy at a Boston ad agency. He was turned down for a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1954.\nKurt and Jane conducted a Great Books course on Cape Cod, and from reading The Odyssey he got an idea for a play, which he called Penelope. He hoped it would be such a big hit that it would \u201cfree me to write plays for the rest of my life.\u201d The play ran for one week at the Orleans Arena Theatre on the Cape.\nIn 1957 the family\u2019s net income from writing\u2014including a loan from Kurt\u2019s agents\u2014came to $3,909.86, which was an improvement over the previous year. The difference between that and what the family needed to live on was made up from an inheritance from Kurt\u2019s father and his working at the Boston ad agency for seven months\u2014as recounted by Jane in her 1987 book, Angels Without Wings: A Courageous Family\u2019s Triumph over Tragedy (published under her newly married name, Jane Vonnegut Yarmolinsky). \u201cWe didn\u2019t let ourselves think about the economics of what had to be done,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe just did it. What we were really living on was hope.\u201d\nIn the midst of this already precarious picture, in 1958 Kurt and Jane took in the four suddenly orphaned children of his older sister, Alice, and her husband, James Adams. Within twenty-four hours of each other, Alice had died of cancer at age forty-one, and her husband was killed when his commuter train crashed off an open drawbridge in New Jersey. Kurt went to Rumson, New Jersey, and brought the four children and two dogs back to live with him, Jane, and their three children on Cape Cod. They raised the oldest three boys, and the baby was taken in a year later by an Alabama relative of James Adams.\nThough the three Adams boys became part of the family, they were never legally adopted, as is often assumed and written. \u201cThat would have taken a lot of time and money, which we didn\u2019t have,\u201d Mark Vonnegut explained to me. Kurt, Jane, and the rest of the family often used the term \u201cadopted\u201d as the easiest way to explain it to the outside world.\nThe Adams boys they took in became known\u2014in what was an affectionate term within the family\u2014as \u201cthe orphans.\u201d\n\u201cIn the ten years prior to the orphans,\u201d Mark wrote in his memoir, \u201che [Kurt] had published one novel and a bunch of short stories without coming close to making a living at it. The roughly ten years disrupted by orphans produced The Sirens of Titan, Mother Night, Cat\u2019s Cradle, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, Welcome to the Monkey House, and Slaughterhouse-Five. Not so bad.\u201d\nFebruary 16, 1950\nAlplaus, NY\nTO MILLER HARRIS", 0.06530435938330675], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["trout", 0.01809954751131222], ["story", 0.01809954751131222],

The habit dies hard. There used to be fleeting fame in it, too. Highly literate people once talked enthusiastically to one another about a story by Ray Bradbury or J. D. Salinger or John Cheever or John Collier or John O\u2018Hara or Shirley Jackson or Flannery O\u2019Connor or whomever, which had appeared in a magazine in the past few days.\nNo more.\nAll I do with short story ideas now is rough them out, credit them to Kilgore Trout, and put them in a novel. Here\u2019s the start of another one hacked from the carcass of Timequake One, and entitled \u201cThe Sisters B-36\u201d: \u201dOn the matriarchal planet Booboo in the Crab Nebula, there were three sisters whose last name was B-36. It could be only a coincidence that their family name was also that of an Earthling airplane designed to drop bombs on civilian populations with corrupt leaderships. Earth and Booboo were too far apart to ever communicate.\u201d\nAnother coincidence: The written language of Booboo was like English on Earth, in that it consisted of idiosyncratic arrangements in horizontal lines of twenty-six phonetic symbols, ten numbers, and about eight punctuation marks.\nAll three of the sisters were beautiful, so went Trout\u2019s tale, but only two of them were popular, one a picture painter and the other a short story writer. Nobody could stand the third one, who was a scientist. She was so boring! All she could talk about was thermodynamics. She was envious. Her secret ambition was to make her two artistic sisters feel, to use a favorite expression of Trout\u2019s, \u201clike something the cat drug in.\u201d\nTrout said Booboolings were among the most adaptable creatures in the local family of galaxies. This was thanks to their great big brains, which could be programmed to do or not do, and feel or not feel, just about anything. You name it!\nThe programming wasn\u2019t done surgically or electrically, or by any other sort of neurological intrusiveness. It was done socially, with nothing but talk, talk, talk. Grownups would speak to little Booboolings favorably about presumably appropriate and desirable feelings and deeds. The brains of the youngsters would respond by growing circuits that made civilized pleasures and behavior automatic.\nIt seemed a good idea, for example, when nothing much was really going on, for Booboolings to be beneficially excited by minimal stimuli, such as idiosyncratic arrangements in horizontal lines of twenty-six phonetic symbols, ten numbers, and eight or so punctuation marks, or dabs of pigment on flat surfaces in frames.\nWhen a little Boobooling was reading a book, a grownup might interrupt to say, depending on what was happening in the book, \u201cIsn\u2019t that sad? The little girl\u2019s nice little dog has just been run over by a garbage truck. Doesn\u2019t that make you want to cry?\u201d Or the grownup might say, about a very different sort of story, \u201cIsn\u2019t that funny? When that conceited old rich man stepped on a nim-nim peel and fell into an open manhole, didn\u2019t that make you practically pop a gut laughing?\u201d\nA nim-nim was a banana-like fruit on Booboo.", 0.06076923076923077], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["harry", 0.0759493670886076], ["radio", 0.05063291139240506], ["throw", 0.05063291139240506], ["helene", 0.0379746835443038], ["window", 0.0379746835443038], ["bottle", 0.0379746835443038], ["warming", 0.0379746835443038], ["wasn", 0.02531645569620253], ["baby", 0.02531645569620253], ["shaw", 0.02531645569620253], ["start", 0.02531645569620253], ["stage", 0.02531645569620253], ["chariot", 0.012658227848101266], ["wilder", 0.012658227848101266], ["scared", 0.012658227848101266], ["scene", 0.012658227848101266], ["scanned", 0.012658227848101266], ["snarled", 0.012658227848101266], ["hanging", 0.012658227848101266], ["ready", 0.012658227848101266], ["happen", 0.012658227848101266], ["open", 0.012658227848101266], ["chase", 0.012658227848101266], ["opened", 0.012658227848101266], ["hod", 0.012658227848101266], ["death", 0.012658227848101266], ["sock", 0.012658227848101266], ["hot", 0.012658227848101266], ["mark", 0.012658227848101266], ["drooping", 0.012658227848101266], ["carrier", 0.012658227848101266], ["sat", 0.012658227848101266], ["limp", 0.012658227848101266], ["shoulders", 0.012658227848101266], ["paperweight", 0.012658227848101266], ["rolled", 0.012658227848101266], ["safe", 0.012658227848101266], ["prizefighter", 0.012658227848101266], ["mouth", 0.012658227848101266], ["hur", 0.012658227848101266], ["directions", 0.012658227848101266], ["hold", 0.012658227848101266], ["wide", 0.012658227848101266], ["runs", 0.012658227848101266], ["ben", 0.012658227848101266], ["lines", 0.012658227848101266], ["looked", 0.012658227848101266], ["eel", 0.012658227848101266], ["eyelids", 0.012658227848101266], ["race", 0.012658227848101266], ["place", 0.012658227848101266], ["iron", 0.012658227848101266], ["clean", 0.012658227848101266], ["head", 0.012658227848101266], ["side", 0.012658227848101266]], "sentiment": ["\"There\u2019s one place where I throw a radio out a window,\" said Harry. \"What can I throw?\"\nSo I said an iron paperweight was the radio, and I opened the window wide.

My father, who was raised in Tennessee, the son of a Baptist minister, was an engineer in the Service Engineering Department of the General Electric Company.\nThe mission of the Service Engineering Department was to install, maintain and repair General Electric heavy equipment sold anywhere in the world. My father, whose assignments were at first only in the United States, was rarely home. And his job demanded such varied forms of technical cleverness of him that he had scant time and imagination left over for anything else. The man was the job and the job was the man.\nThe only nontechnical book I ever saw him look at was a picture history of the First World War.

First of all, I\u2019m fond of you both. I think you\u2019re too soft and spoiled for your own good. I want you to be happy, and I get no fun at all out of hurting you. But you\u2019re still children, and I\u2019m supposed to take care of you to the best of my ability. If I can teach you one simple lesson, I\u2019ll have done a good job of it. You\u2019re evidently going to have to learn the hard way that your happiness for the rest of your lives depends on how well you fit yourselves into other people\u2019s plans, not vice versa; and on how willing you are to submit to the judgment of someone who knows more than you do. Am I right or wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d faltered Hope.\n\u201cYessir,\u201d said Haley. The lesson sounded like an eminently reasonable one, easily committed to memory.\n\u201cWhat you have done tonight has hurt, not helped, all of us,\u201d said the General, \u201cand poor, hare-brained Kitty most of all. You\u2019ll see. Because you helped her run away with that crude, asinine chimpanzee, she is in for nothing but grief. We\u2019ll get her back, because she\u2019s too young to marry without my say so, but she\u2019ll never be the same again \u2014 because you didn\u2019t have the good sense to stop her. Am I right or wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d moaned Haley.

He had been unpopular in Pittsburgh. He had been unpopular because he was stupid and fat and mean, and smelled like bacon no matter how much he washed. He was always being ditched in Pittsburgh by people who did not want him with them.\nIt made Weary sick to be ditched. When Weary was ditched, he would find somebody who was even more unpopular than himself, and he would horse around with that person for a while, pretending to be friendly. And then he would find some pretext for beating the shit out of him.\nIt was a pattern. It was a crazy, sexy, murderous relationship Weary entered into with people he eventually beat up. He told them about his father\u2019s collection of guns and swords and torture instruments and leg irons and so on. Weary\u2019s father, who was a plumber, actually did collect such things, and his collection was insured for four thousand dollars. He wasn\u2019t alone. He belonged to a big club composed of people who collected things like that.\nWeary\u2019s father once gave Weary\u2019s mother a Spanish thumbscrew in working condition\u2014for a kitchen paperweight. Another time he gave her a table lamp whose base was a model one foot high of the famous \u201cIron Maiden of Nuremberg.\u201d The real Iron Maiden was a medieval torture instrument, a sort of boiler which was shaped like a woman on the outside\u2014and lined with spikes. The front of the woman was composed of two hinged doors. The idea was to put a criminal inside and then close the doors slowly. There were two special spikes where his eyes would be. There was a drain in the bottom to let out all the blood.\nSo it goes.\nWeary had told Billy Pilgrim about the Iron Maiden, about the drain in her bottom\u2014and what that was for. He had talked to Billy about dum-dums. He told him about his father\u2019s Derringer pistol, which could be carried in a vest pocket, which was yet capable of making a hole in a man \u201cwhich a bull bat could fly through without touching either wing.\u201d\nWeary scornfully bet Billy one time that he didn\u2019t even know what a blood gutter was. Billy guessed that it was the drain in the bottom of the Iron Maiden, but that was wrong. A blood gutter, Billy learned, was the shallow groove in the side of the blade of a sword or bayonet.\nWeary told Billy about neat tortures he\u2019d read about or seen in the movies or heard on the radio\u2014about other neat tortures he himself had invented. One of the inventions was sticking a dentist\u2019s drill into a guy\u2019s ear. He asked Billy what he thought the worst form of execution was. Billy had no opinion. The correct answer turned out to be this: \u201cYou stake a guy out on an anthill in the desert\u2014see? He\u2019s facing upward, and you put honey all over his balls and pecker, and you cut off his eyelids so he has to stare at the sun till he dies.\u201d So it goes.\nNow, lying in the ditch with Billy and the scouts after having been shot at, Weary made Billy take a very close look at his trench knife. It wasn\u2019t government issue. It was a present from his father. It had a ten-inch blade that was triangular in cross section. Its grip consisted of brass knuckles, was a chain of rings through which Weary slipped his stubby fingers. The rings weren\u2019t simple. They bristled with spikes.\nWeary laid the spikes along Billy\u2019s cheek, roweled the cheek with savagely affectionate restraint. \u201cHow\u2019d you like to be hit with this\u2014hm? Hmmmmmmmmm?\u201d he wanted to know.", -0.04980489417989417], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["photograph", 0.08771929824561403], ["rumfoord", 0.06140350877192982], ["constant", 0.05263157894736842], ["canal", 0.043859649122807015], ["zone", 0.043859649122807015], ["looked", 0.02631578947368421], ["beauty", 0.02631578947368421], ["surface", 0.017543859649122806], ["margins", 0.017543859649122806], ["bay", 0.017543859649122806], ["coral", 0.017543859649122806], ["predecessor", 0.017543859649122806], ["collection", 0.017543859649122806], ["white", 0.017543859649122806], ["glory", 0.017543859649122806], ["ignored", 0.008771929824561403], ["celestial", 0.008771929824561403], ["art", 0.008771929824561403], ["slipped", 0.008771929824561403], ["picture", 0.008771929824561403], ["shimmering", 0.008771929824561403], ["move", 0.008771929824561403], ["turned", 0.008771929824561403], ["wallet", 0.008771929824561403], ["order", 0.008771929824561403], ["held", 0.008771929824561403], ["second", 0.008771929824561403], ["sank", 0.008771929824561403], ["investment", 0.008771929824561403], ["billfold", 0.008771929824561403], ["size", 0.008771929824561403], ["generous", 0.008771929824561403], ["roguishly", 0.008771929824561403], ["takes", 0.008771929824561403], ["prove", 0.008771929824561403], ["three", 0.008771929824561403], ["bug", 0.008771929824561403], ["window", 0.008771929824561403], ["tears", 0.008771929824561403], ["holding", 0.008771929824561403], ["gorgeous", 0.008771929824561403], ["billionaires", 0.008771929824561403], ["ordinary", 0.008771929824561403], ["perfectly", 0.008771929824561403], ["glossy", 0.008771929824561403], ["brown", 0.008771929824561403], ["eyes", 0.008771929824561403], ["shallow", 0.008771929824561403], ["return", 0.008771929824561403], ["love", 0.008771929824561403], ["lulu", 0.008771929824561403], ["felt", 0.008771929824561403], ["begging", 0.008771929824561403], ["depths", 0.008771929824561403], ["glass", 0.008771929824561403], ["chair", 0.008771929824561403], ["purpose", 0.008771929824561403], ["bursting", 0.008771929824561403], ["gate", 0.008771929824561403], ["gold", 0.008771929824561403], ["care", 0.008771929824561403], ["wing", 0.008771929824561403], ["bother", 0.008771929824561403], ["bottom", 0.008771929824561403], ["grinned", 0.008771929824561403], ["rectangular", 0.008771929824561403], ["thought", 0.008771929824561403], ["sensitive", 0.008771929824561403], ["women", 0.008771929824561403], ["supposed", 0.008771929824561403], ["sun", 0.008771929824561403], ["lightning", 0.008771929824561403], ["clear", 0.008771929824561403], ["lay", 0.008771929824561403]], "sentiment": ["The purpose of the collection had been to prove how generous and useful and sensitive billionaires could be. The collection had turned out to be a perfectly gorgeous investment, as well.\n\"That takes care of art,\" said Rumfoord.\nConstant was about to return the photograph of Miss Canal Zone to his billfold, when he felt that he held not one photograph but two. There was a photograph behind that of Miss Canal Zone. He supposed that that was a photograph of Miss Canal Zone\u2019s predecessor, and he thought that he might as well show Rumfoord her, too\u2014show Rumfoord what a celestial lulu he had given the gate to.\n\"There\u2014there\u2019s another one,\" said Constant, holding out the second photograph to Rumfoord.\nRumfoord made no move to take the photograph. He didn\u2019t even bother to look at it. He looked instead into Constant\u2019s eyes and grinned roguishly.\nConstant looked down at the photograph that had been ignored. He found that it was not a photograph of Miss Canal Zone\u2019s predecessor. It was a photograph that Rumfoord had slipped to him. It was no ordinary photograph, though its surface was glossy and its margins white.\nWithin the margins lay shimmering depths. The effect was much like that of a rectangular glass window in the surface of a clear, shallow, coral bay. At the bottom of that seeming coral bay were three women\u2014one white, one gold, one brown.

Al Murray says he thinks this was because slaves had a way of dealing with depression, which their white owners did not.

There wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it, but I always knew.\u201d\nAnd then he scared the wits out of Mary and everybody in the room by sitting up straight, his eyes open wide and fiery. \u201cGet the Bible!\u201d he commanded, in a voice which could be heard throughout the house.\nThis was the only time anything to do with formal religion was mentioned during the whole of his illness. He and Mary were no churchgoers; or prayers in even dire circumstances, but they did have a Bible somewhere.

The cook\u2019s daughter Celeste has every one of them.\nMrs. Berman, the most ferocious enemy of privacy I ever knew, has also discovered that Celeste, although only fifteen, already takes birth-control pills.\nThe formidable widow Berman told me the plot of The Underground, which is this: Three girls, one black, one Jewish and one Japanese, feel drawn together and separate from the rest of their classmates for reasons they can\u2019t explain. They form a little club which they call, again for reasons they can\u2019t explain, \u201cThe Underground.\u201d\nBut then it turns out that all three have a parent or grandparent who has survived some man-made catastrophe, and who, without meaning to, passed on to them the idea that the wicked were the living and that the good were dead.\nThe black is descended from a survivor of the massacre of Ibos in Nigeria. The Japanese is a descendant of a survivor of the atom-bombing of Nagasaki. The Jew is a descendant of a survivor of the Nazi Holocaust.\n\u201cThe Underground is a wonderful title for a book like that,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou bet it is,\u201d she said. \u201cI am very proud of my titles.\u201d She really thinks that she is the cat\u2019s pajamas, and that everybody else is dumb, dumb, dumb!\nShe said that painters should hire writers to name their pictures for them. The names of the pictures on my walls here are \u201cOpus Nine\u201d and \u201cBlue and Burnt Orange\u201d and so on. My own most famous painting, which no longer exists, and which was sixty-four feet long and eight feet high, and used to grace the entrance lobby of the GEFFCo headquarters on Park Avenue, was called

And they don\u2019t hate us for our purported liberty and justice for all. They hate us now for our arrogance.\nWhen I went to grade school in Indianapolis, the James Whitcomb Riley School #43, we used to draw pictures of houses of tomorrow, boats of tomorrow, airplanes of tomorrow, and there were all these dreams for the future. Of course at that time everything had come to a stop. The factories had stopped, the Great Depression was on, and the magic word was Prosperity. Sometime Prosperity will come. We were preparing for it. We were dreaming of the sorts of houses human beings should inhabit\u2014ideal dwellings, ideal forms of transportation.\nWhat is radically new today is that my daughter, Lily, who has just turned twenty-one, finds herself, as do your children, as does George W. Bush, himself a kid, and Saddam Hussein and on and on, heir to a shockingly recent history of human slavery, to an AIDS epidemic, and to nuclear submarines slumbering on the floors of fjords in Iceland and elsewhere, crews prepared at a moment\u2019s notice to turn industrial quantities of men, women, and children into radioactive soot and bone meal by means of rockets and H-bomb warheads. Our children have inherited technologies whose byproducts, whether in war or peace, are rapidly destroying the whole planet as a breathable, drinkable system for supporting life of any kind.\nAnyone who has studied science and talks to scientists notices that we are in terrible danger now. Human beings, past and present, have trashed the joint.\nThe biggest truth to face now\u2014what is probably making me unfunny now for the remainder of my life\u2014is that I don\u2019t think people give a damn whether the planet goes on or not. It seems to me as if everyone is living as members of Alcoholics Anonymous do, day by day. And a few more days will be enough. I know of very few people who are dreaming of a world for their grandchildren.\nMany years ago I was so innocent I still considered it possible that we could become the humane and reasonable America so many members of my generation used to dream of. We dreamed of such an America during the Great Depression, when there were no jobs. And then we fought and often died for that dream during the Second World War, when there was no peace.\nBut I know now that there is not a chance in hell of America becoming humane and reasonable. Because power corrupts us, and absolute power corrupts us absolutely. Human beings are chimpanzees who get crazy drunk on power. By saying that our leaders are power-drunk chimpanzees, am I in danger of wrecking the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East? Their morale, like so many lifeless bodies, is already shot to pieces. They are being treated, as I never was, like toys a rich kid got for Christmas.\nThe most intelligent and decent prayers ever uttered by a famous American, addressed To Whom It May Concern, and following an enormous man-made calamity, were those of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, back when battlefields were small. They could be seen in their entirety by men on horseback atop a hill. Cause and effect were simple. Cause was gunpowder, a mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur. Effect was flying metal. Or a bayonet. Or a rifle butt.\nAbraham Lincoln said this about the silenced killing grounds at Gettysburg:\nWe cannot dedicate\u2014we cannot", 0.11436060606060608], "title": "A Man without a Country"},

"sentiment": ["\u201cAnother one of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.\u2019s greatgrandfathers who attained distinction locally was Henry Schnull, who, with his brother, August, came to Indianapolis from the town of Hausberge in Westphalia about ten years before the Civil War. They had both been apprenticed as Kaufmann, or merchant, in Germany and knew the methods of trade and accounts. They first engaged in the business of buying and selling farm produce in central Indiana. They traveled about in a wagon to the farms in the area; bought grain, butter, eggs, chickens, and salted and smoked pork, and resold these farm products in the city at a profit.\n\u201cAs they prospered by the hardest kind of work, they enlarged their operation by trucking surpluses to Madison or Jeffersonville, Indiana, on the Ohio River, where the merchandise was loaded on huge barges which were floated down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans. One or the other of the brothers would accompany the shipment and attend to the trading in New Orleans. Here they would sell the produce in a good market and buy coffee, rum and sorghum, which was called \u2019New Orleans molasses.\u2019 These products they then shipped north by barge and sold at a profit in Cincinnati or Indianapolis. They are said to have brought to Indianapolis one of the last shipments from the South before the river was closed by the Confederates at Memphis. The price of sorghum and coffee skyrocketed, and the Schnull Brothers then had sufficient capital to establish a wholesale grocery business and construct a warehouse which still stands on the southeast corner of Washington and Delaware Streets in Indianapolis. The firm was originally a partnership known as A. & H. Schnull, later as Schnull & Company. At the close of the Civil War, August announced that he had enough money and wanted to return to Germany. So he sold his interests to Henry and took two hundred thousand dollars back to Hausberge, where he bought a small Schloss and lived like a gentleman until his death in 1918.\n\u201cHenry Schnull elected to remain in the United States. He became one of the leading merchants of Indiana, and was a most highly regarded citizen. In addition to his wholesale grocery business he founded the Eagle Machine Works, which later became the great Atlas Engine Company, which manufactured stationary steam engines and farm implements. He also organized the American Woolen Company, the first textile mill in the State.\n\u201cShortly after passage in 1865 of the law authorizing national banks, he established and was first President of the Merchants National Bank of Indianapolis, which has survived all of the intervening panics and is still operating.\n\u201cHenry Schnull was a man of immense industry, courage, and independence; intelligent, self-reliant, and resourceful; incorruptibly honest and reliable in his dealings; and completely dedicated to business and accumulation. He became very rich for his times, endowed his children with generous gifts, and left a fortune in 1905 which has assisted three generations of his progeny to live comfortably. He was so much engaged with his many activities that he was not much of a family man, and his children saw but little of him. His wife, Matilda Schramm, whom he met on one of his early buying visits to her father\u2019s farm in 1854, was as stern and tough as Henry, but she had a warm, lovable disposition and was the real matriarch of the family.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAll right now: Uncle John has now told us about my two sets of great-grandparents on my father\u2019s side, Clemens Vonnegut, whose wife was Katarina Blank, and Henry Schnull, whose wife was Matilda Schramm, and one set from my mother\u2019s side, the limping Civil War veteran Peter Lieber, whose wife was Sophia de St. Andr\u00e9.\nThis brings me to my fourth set of great-grandparents\u2014the only ones who had anything participatory to do with the arts. They were \u201cProfessor\u201d Karl Barus, \u201cthe first real professional teacher of voice, violin, and piano in the city,\u201d according to Uncle John, and his wife, Alice M\u00f6llman.\n\u201cProfessor Barus was highly respected, and in addition to his function as a private teacher he conducted orchestras, organized choral singing and other musical events. He was well educated and a definite intellectual. He never engaged in trade or business but made a good income by his teaching and lived well. Professor Barus originally settled in Cincinnati in the early fifties, where he was appointed Musical Director of the Cincinnati Sangverein.", 0.17164525820263524], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["everett", 0.05434782608695652], ["dr", 0.05434782608695652], ["married", 0.043478260869565216], ["breed", 0.043478260869565216], ["epizootic", 0.03260869565217391], ["millikan", 0.021739130434782608], ["government", 0.021739130434782608], ["men", 0.021739130434782608], ["understand", 0.021739130434782608], ["photograph", 0.021739130434782608], ["bars", 0.010869565217391304], ["family", 0.010869565217391304], ["young", 0.010869565217391304], ["poisons", 0.010869565217391304], ["number", 0.010869565217391304], ["month", 0.010869565217391304], ["feet", 0.010869565217391304], ["foot", 0.010869565217391304], ["good", 0.010869565217391304], ["rising", 0.010869565217391304], ["rule", 0.010869565217391304], ["razors", 0.010869565217391304], ["chair", 0.010869565217391304], ["work", 0.010869565217391304], ["deceased", 0.010869565217391304], ["centers", 0.010869565217391304], ["billfold", 0.010869565217391304], ["ground", 0.010869565217391304], ["letting", 0.010869565217391304], ["death", 0.010869565217391304], ["cruiser", 0.010869565217391304], ["working", 0.010869565217391304], ["floor", 0.010869565217391304], ["travel", 0.010869565217391304], ["generally", 0.010869565217391304], ["subsided", 0.010869565217391304], ["submit", 0.010869565217391304], ["survivors", 0.010869565217391304], ["eleven", 0.010869565217391304], ["report", 0.010869565217391304], ["firearms", 0.010869565217391304], ["boats", 0.010869565217391304], ["order", 0.010869565217391304], ["hope", 0.010869565217391304], ["head", 0.010869565217391304], ["listlessly", 0.010869565217391304], ["crashes", 0.010869565217391304], ["dollar", 0.010869565217391304], ["airplanes", 0.010869565217391304], ["sales", 0.010869565217391304], ["water", 0.010869565217391304], ["automobiles", 0.010869565217391304], ["background", 0.010869565217391304], ["waterfront", 0.010869565217391304], ["died", 0.010869565217391304], ["population", 0.010869565217391304], ["forty", 0.010869565217391304], ["windows", 0.010869565217391304], ["lying", 0.010869565217391304], ["outlaw", 0.010869565217391304], ["studied", 0.010869565217391304], ["remove", 0.010869565217391304], ["air", 0.010869565217391304], ["rope", 0.010869565217391304], ["credit", 0.010869565217391304], ["knives", 0.010869565217391304], ["cabin", 0.010869565217391304], ["action", 0.010869565217391304], ["anchor", 0.010869565217391304], ["bodies", 0.010869565217391304], ["shook", 0.010869565217391304]], "sentiment": ["\u201cSurvivors?\u201d said Dr. Everett.\n\u201cNone,\u201d said Breed. \u201cThat\u2019s eleven crashes this month\u2014so far.\u201d\n\u201cAll right!

The core of this third personality was a feeling of worthlessness, of shame at being revolted by the poor and by Eliot's personal hygiene, and a suicidal wish to ignore her revulsions, to get back to Rosewater, to very soon die in a good cause.\nSo it was with self-conscious, medically-prescribed, superficial opposition to total sacrifice that she said again, \"No.\"", 0.11538192989805894],

The guard was one hour late. A fighter plane leaped up from the top of a nearby runway, destroyed enough energy to heat one hundred homes for a thousand years, tore the sky to shreds. I did not bat an eyelash. The event was merely tedious to old prisoners and guards at Finletter. It happened all the time.\nMost of the other prisoners, all of them convicted of nonviolent, white-collar crimes, had been trundled away in purple schoolbuses to work details around the base. Only a small housekeeping crew had been left behind\u2014to wash windows, to mop floors. There were a few others around, writing or reading or napping\u2014too sick, with heart trouble or back trouble, usually, to do manual work of any kind. I myself would have been feeding a mangle in the laundry at the base hospital if it had been a day like any other day. My health was excellent, as they say.\nWas I shown no special respect in prison as a Harvard man? It was no distinction, actually. I had met or heard of at least seven others. And no sooner would I leave than my cot would be taken by Virgil Greathouse, former secretary of health, education, and welfare, who was also a Harvard man. I was quite low on the educational ladder at Finletter, with nothing but a poor bachelor\u2019s degree. I was not even a Phi Beta Kappa. We must have had twenty or more Phi Beta Kappas, a dozen or more medical doctors, an equal number of dentists, a veterinarian, a Doctor of Divinity, a Doctor of Economics, a Doctor of Philosophy in chemistry, and simply shoals of disbarred lawyers. Lawyers were so common that we had a joke for newcomers that went like this: \u201cIf you find yourself talking to somebody who hasn\u2019t been to law school, watch your step. He\u2019s either the warden or a guard.\u201d\nMy own poor degree was in the liberal arts, with some emphasis on history and economics. It was my plan when I entered Harvard to become a public servant, an employee rather than an elected official. I believed that there could be no higher calling in a democracy than to a lifetime in government. Since I did not know what branch of government might take me on, whether the State Department or the Bureau of Indian Affairs or whatever, I would make my wisdom as widely applicable as possible. For this reason did I take a liberal arts degree.\nAnd I speak now of my plans and my beliefs\u2014but, being so new to the planet in those days, I had been glad to adopt as my own the plans and beliefs of a much older man. He was a Cleveland multimillionaire named Alexander Hamilton McCone, a member of the Harvard class of Eighteen-hundred and Ninety-four. He was the reclusive, stammering son of Daniel McCone. Daniel McCone was a brilliant and brutal Scottish engineer and metallurgist, who founded the Cuyahoga Bridge and Iron Company, the largest single employer in Cleveland when I was born. Imagine being born as long ago as Nineteen-hundred and Thirteen! Will young people of today doubt me if I aver with a straight face that the Ohio skies back then were often darkened by flocks of hooting pterodactyls, and that forty-ton brontosaurs basked and crooned in the Cuyahoga River\u2019s ooze? No.\nAlexander Hamilton McCone was forty-one years old when I was born into his mansion on Euclid Avenue. He was married to the former Alice Rockefeller, who was even richer than he was, and who spent most of her time in Europe with their one child, a daughter named Clara. Mother and daughter, no doubt embarrassed by Mr. McCone\u2019s terrible speech impediment, and even more dismayed, perhaps, by his wanting to do nothing with his life but read books all day long, were seldom home. Divorce was unthinkable back then.\nClara\u2014are you still alive? She hated me. Some people did and do.\nThat\u2019s life.\nAnd what was I to Mr. McCone, that I should have been born into the unhappy stillness of his mansion? My mother, born Anna Kairys in Russian Lithuania, was his cook. My father, born Stanislaus Stankiewicz in Russian Poland, was his bodyguard and chauffeur. They genuinely loved him.\nMr. McCone built a handsome apartment for them, and for me, too, on the second floor of his carriage house. And, as I grew older, I became his playmate, always indoors. He taught me hearts and old maid, checkers and dominoes\u2014and chess. Soon we were playing only chess. He did not play well. I won almost all of the games, and it is possible that he was secretly drunk. He never tried hard to win, I thought. In any event, and very early on, he began to tell me and my parents that I was a genius, which I surely was not, and that he would send me to Harvard. He must have said to my father and mother a thousand times over the years, \u201cYou are going to find yourselves the proud parents of a perfect Harvard gentleman someday.\u201d", 0.03618820479931591], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["zinka", 0.08035714285714286], ["newt", 0.0625], ["cornell", 0.026785714285714284], ["company", 0.026785714285714284], ["dance", 0.017857142857142856], ["happened", 0.017857142857142856], ["people", 0.017857142857142856], ["girl", 0.017857142857142856], ["american", 0.017857142857142856], ["twenty", 0.017857142857142856], ["performance", 0.017857142857142856], ["indianapolis", 0.017857142857142856], ["impression", 0.008928571428571428], ["materialistic", 0.008928571428571428], ["affair", 0.008928571428571428], ["years", 0.008928571428571428], ["embassy", 0.008928571428571428], ["asylum", 0.008928571428571428], ["inquiries", 0.008928571428571428], ["unkind", 0.008928571428571428], ["weeks", 0.008928571428571428], ["regrets", 0.008928571428571428], ["lucky", 0.008928571428571428], ["press", 0.008928571428571428], ["presented", 0.008928571428571428], ["marry", 0.008928571428571428], ["borzoi", 0.008928571428571428], ["wrote", 0.008928571428571428], ["reread", 0.008928571428571428], ["house", 0.008928571428571428], ["picked", 0.008928571428571428], ["forty", 0.008928571428571428], ["discovery", 0.008928571428571428], ["business", 0.008928571428571428], ["reporter", 0.008928571428571428], ["disappeared", 0.008928571428571428], ["hours", 0.008928571428571428], ["wanted", 0.008928571428571428], ["enterprising", 0.008928571428571428], ["stage", 0.008928571428571428], ["pity", 0.008928571428571428], ["sister", 0.008928571428571428], ["country", 0.008928571428571428], ["newspapers", 0.008928571428571428], ["thing", 0.008928571428571428], ["asked", 0.008928571428571428], ["love", 0.008928571428571428], ["danced", 0.008928571428571428], ["private", 0.008928571428571428], ["dancer", 0.008928571428571428], ["americans", 0.008928571428571428], ["story", 0.008928571428571428], ["political", 0.008928571428571428], ["three", 0.008928571428571428], ["long", 0.008928571428571428], ["wonderful", 0.008928571428571428], ["statement", 0.008928571428571428], ["friend", 0.008928571428571428], ["door", 0.008928571428571428], ["russian", 0.008928571428571428], ["plain", 0.008928571428571428], ["will", 0.008928571428571428], ["matter", 0.008928571428571428], ["making", 0.008928571428571428], ["proof", 0.008928571428571428], ["heart", 0.008928571428571428], ["sad", 0.008928571428571428], ["states", 0.008928571428571428], ["claimed", 0.008928571428571428], ["dozen", 0.008928571428571428], ["stemmed", 0.008928571428571428], ["united", 0.008928571428571428], ["sit", 0.008928571428571428], ["things", 0.008928571428571428], ["roses", 0.008928571428571428], ["moscow", 0.008928571428571428], ["week", 0.008928571428571428], ["beauty", 0.008928571428571428], ["ukrainian", 0.008928571428571428], ["shelter", 0.008928571428571428], ["knew", 0.008928571428571428], ["midget", 0.008928571428571428], ["letter", 0.008928571428571428], ["remember", 0.008928571428571428], ["person", 0.008928571428571428], ["mother", 0.008928571428571428]], "sentiment": ["\u201cP.P.P.S. Twenty-four hours later. I have reread this letter and I can see where somebody might get the impression that I don\u2019t do anything but sit around and remember sad things and pity myself. Actually, I am a very lucky person and I know it. I am about to marry a wonderful little girl. There is love enough in this world for everybody, if people will just look. I am proof of that.\u201d\n8\nNEWT\u2019S THING WITH ZINKA\nNEWT DID NOT TELL ME who his girl friend was. But about two weeks after he wrote to me everybody in the country knew that her name was Zinka\u2014plain Zinka. Apparently she didn\u2019t have a last name.\nZinka was a Ukrainian midget, a dancer with the Borzoi Dance Company. As it happened, Newt saw a performance by that company in Indianapolis, before he went to Cornell. And then the company danced at Cornell. When the Cornell performance was over, little Newt was outside the stage door with a dozen long-stemmed American Beauty roses.\nThe newspapers picked up the story when little Zinka asked for political asylum in the United States, and then she and little Newt disappeared.\nOne week after that, little Zinka presented herself at the Russian Embassy.

But these others who stared now, they remembered. They had been the rioters, the smashers of machines. There was no threat of violence in their looks now, but there was resentment, a wish to let him know that he had intruded where he was not liked.\nAnd still the bartender did not return. Paul limited his field of vision to Rudy, ignoring the rest. The man with thick glasses, whom Rudy had invited to admire Paul, continued to stare.\nPaul talked inanely now about the dog, about Rudy\u2019s remarkable state of preservation. He was helplessly aware that he was hamming it up, proving to anyone who might still have doubts that he was indeed an insincere ass.\n\u201cLet\u2019s drink to old times!\u201d said Rudy, raising his glass. He didn\u2019t seem to notice that silence greeted his proposal, and that he drank alone. He made clucking noises with his tongue, and winked in fond reminiscence, and drained his glass with a flourish. He banged it on the bar.\nPaul, smiling glassily, decided to say nothing more, since anything more would be the wrong thing. He folded his arms and leaned against the keyboard of the player piano. In the silence of the saloon, a faint discord came from the piano, hummed to nothingness.\n\u201cLet\u2019s drink to our sons,\u201d said the man with thick glasses suddenly. His voice was surprisingly high for so resonant-looking a man. Several glasses were raised this time.

This was only 8 weeks before my graduation! So I said, in a spirit of irony, since he knew science did not delight me as it delighted him, that my last opportunity to amount to anything was the County Science Fair. I got Bs in Physics and Chemistry, but you could stuff both those subjects up your fundament as far as I was concerned.\nBut Father rose from his chair in a state of sick excitement. \u201cLet\u2019s go down in the basement,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s work to do.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of work?\u201d I said. This was about midnight.\nAnd he said, \u201cYou are going to enter and win the Science Fair.\u201d\nWHICH I DID. Or, rather, Father entered and won the Science Fair, requiring only that I sign an affidavit swearing that the exhibit was all my own work, and that I memorize his explanation of what it proved. It was about crystals and how they grew and why they grew.\nHis competition was weak. He was, after all, a 43-year-old chemical engineer with 20 years in industry, taking on teenagers in a community where few parents had higher educations. The main business in the county back then was still agriculture, corn and pigs and beef cattle. Barrytron was the sole sophisticated industry, and only a handful of people such as Father understood its processes and apparatus. Most of the company\u2019s employees were content to do what they were told and incurious as to how it was, exactly, that they had worked the miracles that somehow arrived all packaged and labeled and addressed on the loading docks.\nI am reminded now of dead American soldiers, teenagers mostly, all packaged and labeled and addressed on loading docks in Vietnam. How many people knew or cared how these curious artifacts were actually manufactured?\nA few.\nWHY FATHER AND I were not branded as swindlers, why my exhibit was not thrown out of the Science Fair, why I am a prisoner awaiting trial now instead of a star reporter for the Korean owners of The New York Times has to do with compassion, I now believe. The feeling was general in the community, I think, that our little family had suffered enough.

Once again, a stranger was tampering with the privacy of his body bag. He put this question to his parakeet haggardly, and he rolled his eyes: \u201cWhy all this sudden interest in Kilgore Trout?\u201d\nHe read the letter again. \u201cThey not only want Kilgore Trout,\u201d he said, \u201cthey want him in a tuxedo, Bill. Some mistake has been made.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cMaybe they invited me because they know I have a tuxedo,\u201d he said. He really did own a tuxedo. It was in a steamer trunk which he had lugged from place to place for more than forty years. It contained toys from childhood, the bones of a Bermuda Ern, and many other curiosities\u2014including the tuxedo he had worn to a senior dance just prior to his graduation from Thomas Jefferson High School in Dayton, Ohio, in 1924. Trout was born in Bermuda, and attended grammar school there. But then his family moved to Dayton.\nHis high school was named after a slave owner who was also one of the world\u2019s greatest theoreticians on the subject of human liberty.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTrout got his tuxedo out of the trunk and he put it on. It was a lot like a tuxedo I\u2019d seen my father put on when he was an old, old man. It had a greenish patina of mold. Some of the growths it supported resembled patches of fine rabbit fur. \u201cThis will do nicely for the evenings,\u201d said Trout. \u201cBut tell me, Bill\u2014what does one wear in Midland City in October before the sun goes down?\u201d He hauled up his pants legs so that his grotesquely ornamental shins were exposed. \u201cBermuda shorts and bobby socks, eh, Bill? After all\u2014I am from Bermuda.\u201d\nHe dabbed at his tuxedo with a damp rag, and the fungi came away easily. \u201cHate to do this, Bill,\u201d he said of the fungi he was murdering. \u201cFungi have as much right to life as I do. They know what they want, Bill. Damned if I do anymore.\u201d\nThen he thought about what Bill himself might want. It was easy to guess. \u201cBill,\u201d he said, \u201cI like you so much, and I am such a big shot in the Universe, that I will make your three biggest wishes come true.\u201d He opened the door of the cage, something Bill couldn\u2019t have done in a thousand years.\nBill flew over to a windowsill. He put his little shoulder against the glass. There was just one layer of glass between Bill and the great out-of-doors. Although Trout was in the storm window business, he had no storm windows on his own abode.\n\u201cYour second wish is about to come true,\u201d said Trout, and he again did something which Bill could never have done. He opened the window.
