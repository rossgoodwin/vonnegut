He turned to Susan for confirmation.\n\"Uh-uh,\" said Susan, shaking her head dreamily. She put her arms around Lew, and kissed him for about five minutes.\n\"Say,\" I said, patting Susan on the back, \"you kids get along swell, don\u2019t you?

I think about you often anyway\u2014but now I think how much the death of democracy at home must hurt you and Maria Pilar. You must have lost friends. Our son-in-law, Geraldo Rivera, has just come back from Santiago with smuggled films. There were bodies to be seen, shot during curfew, apparently, and left lying where they fell when the sun came up. Curiously, or maybe not so curiously, he interviewed several university students, who told him that the overthrow was a very good thing. They could scarcely say anything else, I guess. And Geraldo himself, a fierce democrat and closet Marxist, has concluded that the elected government was out of control, was a disaster in its own right. I am persuaded that it is now impossible to govern well almost anywhere, and that national tragedies come and go of their own will, like thunderstorms. This makes endurance the most useful human skill.\nVance, who stole my razor, tells me that he found you and Maria Pilar and Jane and Adam and everybody in a generally merry state. Hooray. I am naturally embarrassed by my separation from Jane, which has been interpreted as a faithless act. I think the passing years will make it apparent that she has been reborn into happiness and freedom which were inaccessible while I was with her.

There was a holiday spirit in the air, and the Executive Officer was honing an eighteen-inch bowie knife and humming \u201cAre You from Dixie?\u201d\n\u201cWell, bless mah soul,\u201d he said, noticing me in the doorway, \u201chere\u2019s old \u2018Sprecken Zee Dutch.\u2019 Speak up, boy.

Four Tiger tanks drove up to the front door of Headquarters, and two dozen German infantrymen dismounted to round us up with submachine guns.\n\u201cSay sumpin\u2019,\u201d ordered the Colonel, spunky to the last.\nI ran my eye down the left-hand columns of my pamphlet until I found the phrase that most fairly represented our sentiments. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d I said.", 0.16256038647342996], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
