enthusiasm as the most handsome, healthy, clean-minded specimen of his people. The occasion was the hundred-millionth anniversary of the government of his home planet in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The name of his home planet was Tralfamadore, which old Salo once translated for Rumfoord as meaning both all of us and the number 541.\nThe length of a year on his home planet, according to his own calculations, was 3.6162 times the length of an Earthling year\u2014so the celebration in which he participated was actually in honor of government 361,620,000 Earthling years old. Salo once described this durable form of government to Rumfoord as hypnotic anarchy, but declined to explain its workings. \"Either you understand at once what it is,\" he told Rumfoord, \"or there is no sense in trying to explain it to you, Skip.\"\nHis duty, when he was elected to represent Tralfamadore, was to carry a sealed message from \"One Rim of the Universe to the Other.\" The planners of the ceremonies were not so deluded as to believe that Salo\u2019s projected route spanned the Universe. The image was poetic, as was Salo\u2019s expedition. Salo would simply take the message and go as fast and as far as the technology of Tralfamadore could send him.\nThe message itself was unknown to Salo. It had been prepared by what Salo described to Rumfoord as, \"A kind of university\u2014only nobody goes to it. There aren\u2019t any buildings, isn\u2019t any faculty. Everybody\u2019s in it and nobody\u2019s in it. It\u2019s like a cloud that everybody has given a little puff of mist to, and then the cloud does all the heavy thinking for everybody. I don\u2019t mean there\u2019s really a cloud. I just mean it\u2019s something like that. If you don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m talking about, Skip, there\u2019s no sense in trying to explain it to you. All I can say is, there aren\u2019t any meetings.\"\nThe message was contained in a sealed lead wafer that was two inches square and three-eighths of an inch thick. The water itself was contained in a gold mesh reticule which was hung on a stainless steel band clamped to the shaft that might be called Salo\u2019s neck.\nSalo had orders not to open the reticule and wafer until he arrived at his destination. His destination was not Titan. His destination was in a galaxy that began eighteen million light-years beyond Titan. The planners of the ceremonies in which Salo had participated did not know what Salo was going to find in the galaxy. His instructions were to find creatures in it somewhere, to master their language, to open the message, and to translate it for them.\nSalo did not question the good sense of his errand, since he was, like all Tralfamadorians, a machine. As a machine, he had to do what he was supposed to do.\nOf all the orders Salo received before taking off from Tralfamadore, the one that was given the most importance was that he was not, under any circumstances, to open the message along the way.\nThis order was so emphasized that it became the very core of the little Tralfamadorian messenger\u2019s being.\nIn the Earthling year 203,117 B.C., Salo was forced down in the Solar System by mechanical difficulties. He was forced down by a complete disintegration of a small part in his ship\u2019s power plant, a part about the size of an Earthling beer-can opener. Salo was not mechanically inclined, and so had only a hazy idea as to what the missing part looked like or was supposed to do. Since Salo\u2019s ship was powered by UWTB, the Universal Will to Become, its power plant was nothing for a mechanical dilettante to tinker with.", 0.07022792022792025], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["chicken", 0.03389830508474576], ["university", 0.03389830508474576], ["told", 0.03389830508474576], ["dr", 0.01694915254237288], ["knife", 0.01694915254237288], ["christian", 0.01694915254237288], ["jy", 0.01694915254237288], ["motto", 0.01694915254237288], ["christianity", 0.01694915254237288], ["live", 0.01694915254237288], ["lot", 0.01694915254237288], ["san", 0.01694915254237288], ["butcher", 0.01694915254237288], ["papa", 0.01694915254237288], ["yen", 0.00847457627118644], ["german", 0.00847457627118644], ["fit", 0.00847457627118644], ["father", 0.00847457627118644], ["going", 0.00847457627118644], ["lorenzo", 0.00847457627118644], ["hap", 0.00847457627118644], ["suite", 0.00847457627118644], ["struck", 0.00847457627118644], ["schlichter", 0.00847457627118644], ["stopf", 0.00847457627118644], ["organ", 0.00847457627118644], ["nicely", 0.00847457627118644], ["classified", 0.00847457627118644], ["stuff", 0.00847457627118644], ["rock", 0.00847457627118644], ["popular", 0.00847457627118644], ["bam", 0.00847457627118644], ["commented", 0.00847457627118644], ["zo", 0.00847457627118644], ["tired", 0.00847457627118644], ["kretyeen", 0.00847457627118644], ["observed", 0.00847457627118644], ["1923", 0.00847457627118644], ["cathedral", 0.00847457627118644], ["humana", 0.00847457627118644], ["nee", 0.00847457627118644], ["religion", 0.00847457627118644], ["arkansas", 0.00847457627118644], ["bokononism", 0.00847457627118644], ["conditions", 0.00847457627118644], ["yoze", 0.00847457627118644], ["novelties", 0.00847457627118644], ["understanding", 0.00847457627118644], ["represented", 0.00847457627118644], ["bible", 0.00847457627118644], ["yup", 0.00847457627118644], ["invited", 0.00847457627118644], ["quiet", 0.00847457627118644], ["unknown", 0.00847457627118644], ["tranquilizers", 0.00847457627118644], ["asked", 0.00847457627118644], ["named", 0.00847457627118644], ["bell", 0.00847457627118644], ["feel", 0.00847457627118644], ["explained", 0.00847457627118644], ["sixty", 0.00847457627118644], ["ad", 0.00847457627118644], ["fed", 0.00847457627118644], ["kon", 0.00847457627118644], ["twenty", 0.00847457627118644], ["awarded", 0.00847457627118644], ["yeff", 0.00847457627118644], ["hooner", 0.00847457627118644], ["hemisphere", 0.00847457627118644], ["understand", 0.00847457627118644], ["western", 0.00847457627118644], ["frankly", 0.00847457627118644], ["lorenzans", 0.00847457627118644], ["steez", 0.00847457627118644], ["doctorate", 0.00847457627118644], ["mechanics", 0.00847457627118644], ["gong", 0.00847457627118644], ["von", 0.00847457627118644], ["turned", 0.00847457627118644], ["shame", 0.00847457627118644], ["examine", 0.00847457627118644], ["vox", 0.00847457627118644], ["protestantism", 0.00847457627118644], ["hatbox", 0.00847457627118644], ["insofar", 0.00847457627118644], ["intelligent", 0.00847457627118644], ["catholicism", 0.00847457627118644], ["dynamited", 0.00847457627118644], ["dialect", 0.00847457627118644], ["oon", 0.00847457627118644], ["outlawed", 0.00847457627118644], ["man", 0.00847457627118644], ["age", 0.00847457627118644], ["koenigswald", 0.00847457627118644], ["looked", 0.00847457627118644], ["contact", 0.00847457627118644], ["sect", 0.00847457627118644], ["mother", 0.00847457627118644]], "sentiment": ["He told me there was a live chicken in the hatbox.

Now, if he turned out to be a spectacular athlete \u2026 No. His flaccid physique and pale skin indicated that this avenue to forgiveness was closed to him.\nPaul looked at him sympathetically, and recalled similar bad starts from the past. The man would be terribly lonely, turn to a career of surly drinking, and never be invited again.\nThe only sounds now were the rustling of leaves and the fluttering of the flags, and now and then the clatter of dishes and silverware from the dining hall.\nA harried-looking photographer ran in front of the group, dropped to one knee, fired a flashbulb, and ran away again.", -0.004063492063492055], "title": "Player Piano"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["lew", 0.0423728813559322], ["euphio", 0.0423728813559322], ["fred", 0.025423728813559324], ["marion", 0.01694915254237288], ["program", 0.01694915254237288], ["people", 0.01694915254237288], ["hours", 0.01694915254237288], ["kids", 0.01694915254237288], ["thing", 0.01694915254237288], ["buy", 0.01694915254237288], ["work", 0.01694915254237288], ["turned", 0.01694915254237288], ["selling", 0.01694915254237288], ["price", 0.01694915254237288], ["supper", 0.01694915254237288], ["points", 0.01694915254237288], ["time", 0.01694915254237288], ["pleases", 0.00847457627118644], ["aghast", 0.00847457627118644], ["bring", 0.00847457627118644], ["chair", 0.00847457627118644], ["tv", 0.00847457627118644], ["failed", 0.00847457627118644], ["save", 0.00847457627118644], ["pneumonia", 0.00847457627118644], ["big", 0.00847457627118644], ["break", 0.00847457627118644], ["hands", 0.00847457627118644], ["day", 0.00847457627118644], ["knock", 0.00847457627118644], ["malnutrition", 0.00847457627118644], ["kill", 0.00847457627118644], ["husband", 0.00847457627118644], ["clockwork", 0.00847457627118644], ["business", 0.00847457627118644], ["matter", 0.00847457627118644], ["god", 0.00847457627118644], ["fans", 0.00847457627118644], ["experiment", 0.00847457627118644], ["civilization", 0.00847457627118644], ["reverently", 0.00847457627118644], ["monster", 0.00847457627118644], ["power", 0.00847457627118644], ["rolled", 0.00847457627118644], ["burn", 0.00847457627118644], ["killing", 0.00847457627118644], ["sixty", 0.00847457627118644], ["thirty", 0.00847457627118644], ["repairman", 0.00847457627118644], ["days", 0.00847457627118644], ["american", 0.00847457627118644], ["groin", 0.00847457627118644], ["cyanide", 0.00847457627118644], ["family", 0.00847457627118644], ["bedtime", 0.00847457627118644], ["toys", 0.00847457627118644], ["owner", 0.00847457627118644], ["expensive", 0.00847457627118644], ["kidding", 0.00847457627118644], ["stuck", 0.00847457627118644], ["going", 0.00847457627118644], ["happy", 0.00847457627118644], ["head", 0.00847457627118644], ["door", 0.00847457627118644], ["mind", 0.00847457627118644], ["potassium", 0.00847457627118644], ["hoped", 0.00847457627118644], ["dull", 0.00847457627118644], ["whisky", 0.00847457627118644], ["hair", 0.00847457627118644], ["room", 0.00847457627118644], ["hour", 0.00847457627118644], ["movies", 0.00847457627118644], ["listen", 0.00847457627118644], ["minutes", 0.00847457627118644], ["radio", 0.00847457627118644], ["proved", 0.00847457627118644], ["fights", 0.00847457627118644], ["eyes", 0.00847457627118644], ["interrupted", 0.00847457627118644], ["families", 0.00847457627118644], ["breakfast", 0.00847457627118644], ["trip", 0.00847457627118644], ["cross", 0.00847457627118644], ["rome", 0.00847457627118644], ["sets", 0.00847457627118644], ["arose", 0.00847457627118644], ["america", 0.00847457627118644], ["incredulously", 0.00847457627118644], ["wife", 0.00847457627118644], ["eats", 0.00847457627118644], ["person", 0.00847457627118644], ["bottle", 0.00847457627118644], ["numbing", 0.00847457627118644]], "sentiment": ["\"In the groin?\" Fred said.\n\"What\u2019s the matter with you people?\" Lew said. \"You act as though the experiment had failed.\"\n\"Pneumonia and malnutrition are what we\u2019d hoped for?\" Marion said.\n\"We had a cross section of America in this room, and we made every last person happy,\" Lew said. \"Not for just an hour, not for just a day, but for two days without a break.\" He arose reverently from his chair. \"So what we do to keep it from killing the euphio fans is to have the thing turned on and off with clockwork, see?

We\u2019d love to have you in the neighborhood. I\u2019m still very jazzed by the place. All the big problems and all the big solutions are here, it seems to me. As for plays: well, this is the only place you can find an American audience, and both of us sure as hell need American audiences. A batch of playwrights all fifteen years or so younger than we are is doing splendidly.\nI have this house now, facing E.B. White\u2019s former house in Turtle Bay. Halberstam is in there now. I work on the top floor, and we live on the next two floors, and Jill has her office at street level, with a separate entrance. It works out pretty good, only I can\u2019t think of anything to write about any more. I may have retired. I\u2019ll have to ask my lawyer.\nWe have guest rooms, so it will be swell if you can stay here when you next pass through. I don\u2019t quite understand the scheme you\u2019ve worked out with Tina, probably because I wasn\u2019t supposed to understand. Anyway, it sounds exciting for the kids.\nI don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to teach any more. It\u2019s a damaging, pooping thing to do. I\u2019ve cut my teach load in half, but I still feel as though I\u2019m waltzing with tarbaby all day long.\nI see a fair amount of Gail Godwin and her lover these days. She came to Jill\u2019s birthday party a couple of days ago. She is highly regarded at Knopf. The biggest literary news, I guess, also to do with Knopf, is that Heller has absolutely finished his new book, and that it isn\u2019t funny at all. It\u2019s great, they say, and tragic. His editor and Gail\u2019s editor is the guy who sold me this house\u2014Bob Gottlieb.\nCheers\u2014", 0.17859180035650624], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["harold", 0.15789473684210525], ["penelope", 0.15789473684210525], ["looseleaf", 0.10526315789473684], ["shut", 0.05263157894736842], ["angrily", 0.05263157894736842], ["ninny", 0.05263157894736842], ["openly", 0.05263157894736842], ["steps", 0.05263157894736842], ["stand", 0.05263157894736842], ["mom", 0.05263157894736842], ["shuttle", 0.05263157894736842], ["paul", 0.05263157894736842], ["appears", 0.05263157894736842], ["cheerfully", 0.05263157894736842]], "sentiment": ["Who was it?\nPAUL\nIt's Mom.\nHe steps aside.
