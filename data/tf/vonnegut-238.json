They, at least, are sympathetic and imaginatively helpful. Mary begins to massage and perfume the feet of Jesus Christ with an ointment made from the spikenard plant. Jesus has the bones of a man and is clothed in the flesh of a man\u2014 so it must feel awfully nice, what Mary is doing to his feet. Would it be heretical of us to suppose that Jesus closes his eyes?\n\u201cThis is too much for that envious hypocrite Judas, who says, trying to be more Catholic than the Pope: \u2019Hey\u2014 this is very un-Christian. Instead of wasting that stuff on your feet, we should have sold it and given the money to the poor people.\u2019\n\u201cTo which Jesus replies in Aramaic: Judas, don\u2019t worry about it. There will still be plenty of poor people left long after I\u2019m gone.\u2019\n\u201cThis is about what Mark Twain or Abraham Lincoln would have said under similar circumstances.\n\u201cIf Jesus did in fact say that, it is a divine black joke, well suited to the occasion. It says everything about hypocrisy and nothing about the poor. It is a Christian joke, which allows Jesus to remain civil to Judas, but to chide him about his hypocrisy all the same.\n\u201c\u2019Judas, don\u2019t worry about it. There will still be plenty of poor people left long after I\u2019m gone.\u2019\n\u201cShall I regarble it for you? \u2019The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.\u2019\n\u201cMy own translation does no violence to the words in the Bible. I have changed their order some, not merely to make them into the joke the situation calls for, but to harmonize them, too, with the Sermon on the Mount. The Sermon on the Mount suggests a mercifulness that can never waver or fade.\n\u201cThis has no doubt been a silly sermon. I am sure you do not mind.

Anyone caught in that godforsaken moment in that godforsaken place would have to cower on that hot copper under those big wet boulders\u2014would have to take whatever Nature was going to hurl down next.\nIt was an upsetting painting, a painting that only a museum or a dedicated collector would give houseroom to. Lazarro\u2019s sales were few.\nLazarro himself was upsetting\u2014seemingly crude and angry. He liked to seem dangerous, to seem the hoodlum he\u2019d almost been. He wasn\u2019t dangerous. He was afraid. He was afraid that he was the biggest humbug of all.\nHe lay fully dressed on his bed in the dark. The only light in his studio came from the overflow of Stedman\u2019s profligate lighting scheme across the way. He was thinking morosely about the presents he had hoped to buy with his two-hundred-dollar first prize. The presents would have gone to his wife, but creditors had snatched the prize money away.\nSylvia left the window, sat down on the edge of his bed. She had been a pert, uncomplicated waitress when Lazarro had wooed her. Three years with a complicated, brilliant husband had put circles under her eyes. And bill collectors had reduced her pertness to gamely gay despair. But Sylvia wasn\u2019t about to give up. She thought her husband was another Raphael.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you read what the man said about you in the paper?\u201d she said.\n\u201cArt critics never make any sense to me,\u201d said Lazarro.\n\u201cYou make a lot of sense to them,\u201d said Sylvia.\n\u201cHooray,\u201d said Lazarro emptily. The more praise he got from critics, the more he secretly cowered on hot copper under a boulder sky. His hands and eyes were so poorly disciplined that he could not draw the simplest likeness. His paintings were brutal, not because he wished to express brutality, but because he could paint no other way. On the surface, Lazarro had only contempt for Stedman. Down deep, he was in awe of Stedman\u2019s hands and eyes\u2014hands and eyes that could do anything Stedman asked them to do.\n\u201cLord Stedman has a birthday in ten days,\u201d said Sylvia.

The \u201cimportant book\u201d was Nora\u2019s Tale.\nDear Edith\u2014\nI saw your charming show in Watermill yesterday. I went alone, and had no other purpose in my trip than to see your show. I didn\u2019t go the day before, because I thought you needed the car for an enormous gang. You said more people were going than the car could hold.\nAnyway\u2014I signed the book within twenty-four hours of the time the show opened, and I saw it all, and I thought about it all.\nAnd, since you have no other older person around to tell you what to do, I will tell you what to do. When I was a young writer, I had all kinds of older people who told me what to do. They were often right, and they were often wrong, but they were sure around and caring. Knox Burger was one, even though he was only one month older. Max Wilkinson was another, and Ken Littauer, to whom I dedicated Slaughterhouse-5, was yet another one. I argued with them all, and in fact stopped talking to two out of the three. Ken is dead. Knox is a bitter stranger. Only Max remains a friend. Vitamin B-6 might have changed all that, but it\u2019s too late now. And why shouldn\u2019t they be the ones to take mega-vitamins anyway? Why should I take all the pills?\nAs for what you should do next, in my opinion: I already note that you were the first of my children to publish an important book. You have no catching up to do. And life isn\u2019t a foot-race anyway. Nora\u2019s Tale is graver and far less fashionable than anything Edward Gorey, for instance, may ever care to do. But, again: You aren\u2019t racing Gorey or me or Mark or anyone.\nAnd there is no reason why I should expect you to be clear-headed, either. You are sophisticated, and you are also in financial trouble\u2014so, like me, when I was young, you have to try to do all sorts of financial and artistic things all at once.\nAnd I agree that you should do all sorts of things all at once. You have to, since you want to be self-supporting. But I hope that one of the many things you do will incorporate your own deeply personal hopes and fears and joys and angers and so on. Such things are excluded from your show in Watermill, and from your conversations with me, as far as that goes. The things of yours which earn you the most money just now will no doubt be your cleanest, clearest works.\nAnd you hang out with people who bring to market only things which are super-fashionable, untroubling, and super-clean.", 0.12935374149659865], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["looseleaf", 0.13157894736842105], ["penelope", 0.05263157894736842], ["long", 0.05263157894736842], ["harold", 0.05263157894736842], ["guys", 0.05263157894736842], ["shop", 0.02631578947368421], ["kisses", 0.02631578947368421], ["motorcycle", 0.02631578947368421], ["walks", 0.02631578947368421], ["colonel", 0.02631578947368421], ["whore", 0.02631578947368421], ["closes", 0.02631578947368421], ["guess", 0.02631578947368421], ["things", 0.02631578947368421], ["going", 0.02631578947368421], ["shuttle", 0.02631578947368421], ["helicopter", 0.02631578947368421], ["nice", 0.02631578947368421], ["door", 0.02631578947368421], ["job", 0.02631578947368421], ["fly", 0.02631578947368421], ["exits", 0.02631578947368421], ["turns", 0.02631578947368421], ["marry", 0.02631578947368421], ["departure", 0.02631578947368421], ["will", 0.02631578947368421], ["gathers", 0.02631578947368421], ["dunno", 0.02631578947368421], ["acknowledges", 0.02631578947368421], ["silence", 0.02631578947368421]], "sentiment": ["LOOSELEAF walks around and gathers his things.\nLOOSELEAF\nSo long, you guys.\nPENELOPE\nWhat will you do, Colonel?\nLOOSELEAF\nI dunno.
