Unfortunately back then I was majoring in chemistry, at the insistence of my father: \u201cLearn a trade!\u201d\nIn any case, I cannot be of any use to you and your students nowadays, alas, since, at 84, I resemble nothing so much as an iguana, hate travel, and have nothing to say. I might as well send a spent Roman candle in my stead.\nSo no gig there, for want of a performer.\nI scarcely write anything anymore, save for letters like this one. I am making pictures, though, which my partner turns into silk screens, [\u2026] If you are curious about their nature, you can find some of them at www.Vonnegut.com. I myself can\u2019t find them that way, since I don\u2019t have a computer, nor a cell phone, nor even an answering machine.\nBut God bless you for being a teacher.\nCheers, dear Alice, also my sister\u2019s name.\nThese were the last words of advice Vonnegut wrote to be delivered to an audience:", -0.07666666666666667], "title": "Letters"}}
