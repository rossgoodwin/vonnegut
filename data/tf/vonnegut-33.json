writers. In Timequake One, I envisioned a writers\u2019 retreat called Xanadu, where each of the four guest suites was named in honor of an American winner of a Nobel Prize for Literature. The Ernest Hemingway and Eugene O\u2019Neill were on the second floor of the mansion. The Sinclair Lewis was on the third. The John Steinbeck was in the carriage house.\nKilgore Trout exclaimed upon arriving at Xanadu, two weeks after free will kicked in again, \u201cAll four of your ink-on-paper heroes were certifiable alcoholics!\u201d\nGambling ruined William Saroyan. A combination of booze and gambling did in the journalist Alvin Davis, a much-missed friend of mine. I asked Al one time what was the biggest kick he got from games of chance. He said it came after he had lost all his money in an around-the-clock poker game.\nHe went back after a few hours with money he had gotten wherever he could get it, from a friend, from hocking something, from a loanshark. And he sat down at the table and said, \u201cDeal me in.\u201d\nThe late British philosopher Bertrand Russell said he lost friends to one of three addictions: alcohol or religion or chess. Kilgore Trout was hooked on making idiosyncratic arrangements in horizontal lines, with ink on bleached and flattened wood pulp, of twenty-six phonetic symbols, ten numbers, and about eight punctuation marks. He was a black hole to anyone who might imagine that he or she was a friend of his.\nI have been married twice, divorced once. Both my wives, Jane and now Jill, have said on occasion that I am much like Trout in that regard.\nMy mother was addicted to being rich, to servants and unlimited charge accounts, to giving lavish dinner parties, to taking frequent first-class trips to Europe. So one might say she was tormented by withdrawal symptoms all through the Great Depression.\nShe was acculturated!\nAcculturated persons are those who find that they are no longer treated as the sort of people they thought they were, because the outside world has changed. An economic misfortune or a new technology, or being conquered by another country or political faction, can do that to people quicker than you can say \u201cJack Robinson.\u201d", 0.09356565656565659], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["harry", 0.08888888888888889], ["promise", 0.044444444444444446], ["helene", 0.044444444444444446], ["hand", 0.044444444444444446], ["curtain", 0.044444444444444446], ["cast", 0.044444444444444446], ["wishers", 0.022222222222222223], ["scared", 0.022222222222222223], ["rest", 0.022222222222222223], ["jump", 0.022222222222222223], ["parties", 0.022222222222222223], ["standing", 0.022222222222222223], ["afraid", 0.022222222222222223], ["plays", 0.022222222222222223], ["thing", 0.022222222222222223], ["crew", 0.022222222222222223], ["window", 0.022222222222222223], ["won", 0.022222222222222223], ["call", 0.022222222222222223], ["lot", 0.022222222222222223], ["shy", 0.022222222222222223], ["party", 0.022222222222222223], ["final", 0.022222222222222223], ["red", 0.022222222222222223], ["wouldn", 0.022222222222222223], ["brando", 0.022222222222222223], ["stay", 0.022222222222222223], ["tied", 0.022222222222222223], ["famous", 0.022222222222222223], ["wanted", 0.022222222222222223], ["stage", 0.022222222222222223], ["couldn", 0.022222222222222223], ["marlon", 0.022222222222222223], ["thought", 0.022222222222222223], ["audience", 0.022222222222222223], ["tongue", 0.022222222222222223], ["panicky", 0.022222222222222223]], "sentiment": ["When the curtain came down on the final curtain call, Harry wanted to get away, but he couldn\u2019t.

He bought Coca-Cola stock, which acted the way he did, as though it didn\u2019t even know a depression was going on. And Mother still had all the bank stock she had inherited from her father. Because of all the prime farmland it had acquired through foreclosures, it was as good as gold.\nThis was dumb luck.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was soda fountains as much as the Depression that wrecked the Waltz Brothers chain. Pharmacists have no business being in the food business, too. Leave the food business to those who know and love it.\nOne of Father\u2019s favorite jokes, I remember, was about the boy who flunked out of pharmacy school. He didn\u2019t know how to make a club sandwich.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere is still one Waltz Brothers Drugstore left, I have heard, in Cairo, Illinois.

The streets are cobblestoned, like the floor of my childhood home.

found himself wondering who it was that he could trust. Everyone seemed intent on worrying him into a pattern of their own making, rather than trying to understand what it might be like to be Haley Brandon. He wondered most about Hope. With discomfiting insight, he recognized that any attention she might have shown him was probably a subtle defiance of her father. \u201cLike protecting Caesar and Delores from him,\u201d he thought ruefully.\nWhen they set about flinging bales onto the wagon, the circle of Haley\u2019s thoughts grew smaller, with limits set at the hard work on hand. He was pleased to see that he was accomplishing nearly as much as Mr. Banghart. It was more a matter of rhythm than strength\u2014swinging the bales several times, then giving them a hearty boost with a knee on their upward arcs. True, when the load was three bales high, pitches more hefty than Haley\u2019s were called for, but he was able to make himself useful by sitting atop the load and pulling the bales into place as Mr. Banghart tossed them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a load!\u201d he cried, when the fifth tier was complete.\nMr. Banghart shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll stack her seven high and save time,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be above the stakes,\u201d Haley warned.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it a million times,\u201d said Mr. Banghart. \u201cNothing to it. Just drive easy, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nHaley looked dubiously at the horses, who were keeping their harness taut and clinking with their restlessness. In a few minutes he was seated uneasily on a swaying load seven bales high, with Mr. Banghart beside him singing and preparing to start the team for the barn. He peered over the edge of the bales at the ground and had the chilly impression of being perched on a steep cliff overlooking a gorge miles below.\nAt Mr. Banghart\u2019s soft clucking, Caesar and Delores started off evenly and good-naturedly. The bales rocked as the wheels struck rocks and pits in the lane, but not one had dropped off when the wagon rolled at last onto the hard-packed earth of the barnyard near the house. Mr. Banghart had looked at the sun and guessed that the time was between 8 and 9 o\u2019clock. Haley noted that the General was no longer abed, for his beloved automobile, as immaculate and glistening as a thousand-dollar casket, was out of the garage and parked in the driveway near the kitchen door. No one was outside.\nSuddenly the bales beneath Haley gave a great heave, and he felt himself hurtling downward, with Mr. Banghart shouting in midair beside him. The whack of his chest against the earth stunned away his breath and senses. When he regained them, it was in time to roll out of the way of Caesar and Delores, who had made a full circle in the barnyard and now bore down upon him with fury. The emptied wagon clattered behind them, its steel-bound wheels screeching on dry bearings and striking sparks from rocks as it came. The team turned into the driveway at a full run. The wagon shot a spray of gravel rattling against the back of the house, and its right wheels skidded into a shallow ditch to set it careening at a crazy angle.\nHaley tried to shout at the horses, but he managed only a whisper, which was immediately overwhelmed by a splintering, ripping, staggering crash, followed by silence, unruffled save for a muted, rhythmic roar in the now-motionless horses\u2019 throats. On one side of the General\u2019s new automobile stood Caesar, his harness askew and dragging, blood streaming from his wounded mouth. On the other side Delores lay gasping, festooned in a tangle of snapped lines and straps.", 0.11886035681490226], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["banghart", 0.04672897196261682], ["haley", 0.037383177570093455], ["driver", 0.037383177570093455], ["looked", 0.028037383177570093], ["window", 0.018691588785046728], ["clothes", 0.018691588785046728], ["jobs", 0.018691588785046728], ["chicago", 0.018691588785046728], ["neon", 0.009345794392523364], ["ended", 0.009345794392523364], ["bright", 0.009345794392523364], ["growled", 0.009345794392523364], ["quake", 0.009345794392523364], ["yep", 0.009345794392523364], ["heavens", 0.009345794392523364], ["fine", 0.009345794392523364], ["find", 0.009345794392523364], ["late", 0.009345794392523364], ["thump", 0.009345794392523364], ["crowds", 0.009345794392523364], ["denim", 0.009345794392523364], ["surprised", 0.009345794392523364], ["good", 0.009345794392523364], ["blinking", 0.009345794392523364], ["walls", 0.009345794392523364], ["dreams", 0.009345794392523364], ["red", 0.009345794392523364], ["clay", 0.009345794392523364], ["side", 0.009345794392523364], ["house", 0.009345794392523364], ["sensation", 0.009345794392523364], ["seat", 0.009345794392523364], ["relative", 0.009345794392523364], ["traveling", 0.009345794392523364], ["bales", 0.009345794392523364], ["will", 0.009345794392523364], ["entertainment", 0.009345794392523364], ["falling", 0.009345794392523364], ["airily", 0.009345794392523364], ["revealing", 0.009345794392523364], ["remembered", 0.009345794392523364], ["sing", 0.009345794392523364], ["boy", 0.009345794392523364], ["afternoon", 0.009345794392523364], ["nearby", 0.009345794392523364], ["tone", 0.009345794392523364], ["image", 0.009345794392523364], ["rising", 0.009345794392523364], ["caked", 0.009345794392523364], ["strip", 0.009345794392523364], ["city", 0.009345794392523364], ["checked", 0.009345794392523364], ["automobile", 0.009345794392523364], ["start", 0.009345794392523364], ["fragrance", 0.009345794392523364], ["sort", 0.009345794392523364], ["stomach", 0.009345794392523364], ["offhand", 0.009345794392523364], ["trousers", 0.009345794392523364], ["filled", 0.009345794392523364], ["town", 0.009345794392523364], ["kind", 0.009345794392523364], ["toppling", 0.009345794392523364], ["solid", 0.009345794392523364], ["work", 0.009345794392523364], ["yawned", 0.009345794392523364], ["soul", 0.009345794392523364], ["workshoes", 0.009345794392523364], ["faded", 0.009345794392523364], ["awakened", 0.009345794392523364], ["called", 0.009345794392523364], ["turned", 0.009345794392523364], ["sudden", 0.009345794392523364], ["rent", 0.009345794392523364], ["rolled", 0.009345794392523364], ["preferably", 0.009345794392523364], ["shirt", 0.009345794392523364], ["hungrily", 0.009345794392523364], ["floor", 0.009345794392523364], ["things", 0.009345794392523364], ["sunday", 0.009345794392523364], ["laughed", 0.009345794392523364], ["pink", 0.009345794392523364], ["felt", 0.009345794392523364], ["curiosity", 0.009345794392523364], ["sunburn", 0.009345794392523364], ["lifting", 0.009345794392523364], ["incredulously", 0.009345794392523364], ["light", 0.009345794392523364], ["bakery", 0.009345794392523364], ["time", 0.009345794392523364]], "sentiment": ["In his dreams Haley felt again the quake of the toppling bales and the sensation of falling.

He honestly thought it was all right. He couldn\u2019t remember the name of the woman.\n\u201cHow come they call you Billy instead of William?\u201d\n\u201cBusiness reasons,\u201d said Billy. That was true. His father-in-law, who owned the Ilium School of Optometry, who had set Billy up in practice, was a genius in his field. He told Billy to encourage people to call him Billy\u2014because it would stick in their memories. It would also make him seem slightly magical, since there weren\u2019t any other grown Billys around. It also compelled people to think of him as a friend right away.\nSomewhere in there was an awful scene, with people expressing disgust for Billy and the woman, and Billy found himself out in his automobile, trying to find the steering wheel.\nThe main thing now was to find the steering wheel. At first, Billy windmilled his arms, hoping to find it by luck. When that didn\u2019t work, he became methodical, working in such a way that the wheel could not possibly escape him. He placed himself hard against the left-hand door, searched every square inch of the area before him. When he failed to find the wheel, he moved over six inches, and searched again. Amazingly, he was eventually hard against the right-hand door, without having found the wheel. He concluded that somebody had stolen it. This angered him as he passed out.\nHe was in the back seat of his car, which was why he couldn\u2019t find the steering wheel.\nNow somebody was shaking Billy awake. Billy still felt drunk, was still angered by the stolen steering wheel. He was back in World War Two again, behind the German lines. The person who was shaking him was Roland Weary.

Darwin, if, as was becoming harder and harder to believe, it would really sail next day.\n13\n*ZENJI HIROGUCHI begat Gokubi one million and five years ago, and then, one million years ago, this young genius begat Mandarax. Yes, and at the time of his begetting of Mandarax, his wife was about to give birth to his first human child.\nThere had been concern about the genes the mother, Hisako, might have passed on to her fetus, since her own mother had been exposed to radiation when the United States of America dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. So a sample of Hisako\u2019s amniotic fluid was tested back in Tokyo for clues that the child might be abnormal. That fluid, incidentally, would be identical in salinity with that of the ocean into which the Bah\u00eda de Darwin would disappear.\nThe tests declared the fetus normal.\nThey also gave away the secret of its sex. It would come into the world as a little girl, yet another female in this tale.\nThe tests were incapable of detecting minor defects in the fetus, such as that it might be as tone deaf as Mary Hepburn, which it wasn\u2019t\u2014or that it might be covered with a fine, silky pelt like a fur seal\u2019s, which would actually turn out to be the case.\nThe only human being *Zenji Hiroguchi would ever beget was a darling but furry daughter he would never see.\nShe would be born on Santa Rosalia, at the northernmost extremity of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Her name would be Akiko.\nWhen Akiko became an adult on Santa Rosalia, she would be very much like her mother on the inside, but in a different sort of skin. The evolutionary sequence from Gokubi to Mandarax, by contrast, was a radical improvement in the contents of a package, but with few perceptible changes in the wrapper. Akiko was protected from sunburn, and from the chilly water when she swam, and the abrasiveness of lava when she chose to sit or lie down\u2014whereas her mother\u2019s bare skin was wholly defenseless against these ordinary hazards of island life. But Gokubi and Mandarax, as different as they were inside, inhabited nearly identical shells of high-impact black plastic, twelve centimeters high, eight wide, and two thick.",

paint pictures as well as anyone. So I would go to bars around NYU at night, and easily made friends with several painters who thought they were right about almost everything, but who never expected to receive much recognition. I could talk as well as the best of them, and drink as much as they could. Best of all, I could pick up the check at the end of the evening, thanks to the money I was making in the stock market, subsistence payments I was receiving from the government while going to the university, and a lifetime pension from a grateful nation for my having given one eye in defense of Liberty.\nTo the real painters I seemed a bottomless pit of money. I was good not only for the cost of drinks, but for rent, for a down payment on a car, for a girlfriend\u2019s abortion, for a wife\u2019s abortion. You name it. However much money they needed for no matter what, they could get it from Diamond Rabo Karabekian.\nSo I bought those friends. My pit of money wasn\u2019t really bottomless. By the end of every month they had taken me for everything I had. But then the pit, a small one, would fill up again.\nFair was fair. I certainly enjoyed their company, especially since they treated me as though I were a painter, too. I was one of them. Here was another big family to replace my lost platoon.\nAnd they paid me back with more than companionship. They settled their debts as best they could with pictures nobody wanted, too.\nI almost forgot to say: I was married and my wife was pregnant at the time. She would be twice impregnated by that incomparable lover, Rabo Karabekian.\nI have now returned to this typewriter from the vicinity of the swimming pool, where I asked Celeste and her friends in and around that public teenage athletic facility, if they knew who Bluebeard was. I meant to mention Bluebeard in this book. I wanted to know if I had to explain, for the sake of young readers, who Bluebeard was.\nNobody knew. While I was at it, I asked them if they recognized the names of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, or Terry Kitchen, or Truman Capote, or Nelson Algren, or Irwin Shaw, or James Jones, all of whom had figured not only in the history of arts and letters but in the history of the Hamptons. They did not. So much for achieving immortality via the arts and letters.\nSo: Bluebeard is a fictitious character in a very old children\u2019s tale, possibly based loosely on a murderous nobleman of long ago. In the story, he has married many times. He marries for the umpteenth time, and brings his latest child bride back to his castle. He tells her that she can go into any room but one, whose door he shows her.\nBluebeard is either a poor psychologist or a great one, since all his new wife can think about is what might be behind the door. So she takes a look when she thinks he isn\u2019t home, but he really is home.", 0.24332480758012676], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "a-man-without-a-country": {"tfidf": [["correct", 0.19230769230769232],

my grandfather Bernard, who are the stars in this account of my ancestors. There are reasons for this. \u201cIt is regrettable that so little is known of K\u2019s two grandmothers and four great-grandmothers,\u201d says Uncle John. \u201cPractically everyone who knew any of them intimately is now dead. The Victorian age in which they lived was a man\u2019s world. Women\u2019s place was in the home, and no public notice was taken of them. They left no records of their own, and were expected to bask in obscurity in the reflected glory of their husbands\u2019 achievements\u2014the most admired of which was the accumulation of money.\n\u201cBut they bore the children, which was one thing the men could not do. They ran the households admirably, and provided their progeny with all their training in manners and morals which they received.\n\u201cThe men were so much engaged in the struggle for material success that they gave but scant attention to their families. How they found time to father their children is conjectural. But in defense of the men it should be noted that they were emotionally and psychologically motivated to assert their own importance in a new environment: to achieve and to demonstrate their worth as individuals. Success was principally equated with money. To be rich was to be respected.\n\u201cThe immigrants had been literally starved\u2014materially and socially\u2014in the nineteenth century of Western Europe. When they came here and found the rich table of the Midwest, they gorged themselves. And who can blame them? In the process they created an Empire by the hardest work and exercise of their inherent and varied talents. The men took the credit, but their womenfolk, if unnoticed, helped lay the foundation.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLet Uncle John now run out his story of my family without further interruptions from me. There remain only a father and a mother to be described.\n\u201cK\u2019s father\u2014Kurt, the eldest son of Bernard and Nannie\u2014was very much like his father in oudook and pattern of behavior, but dissimilar in appearance. Bernard was dark complected, wore a beard, and was rather bald. Kurt was blue-eyed, and very fair complected, with finely modeled features, long thin fingers, and blond curly hair. He was a sort of Adonis and extremely handsome, without any trace of effeminacy. He was, like his father, artistic. He could draw and paint. He worked in ceramics, and created some beautiful objects in that technique. And, of course, he was a fine, sensitive architect.\n\u201cKurt Vonnegut attended School No. 10, a grammar school, from 1890 to 1898. He then attended Shortridge High School in Indianapolis for somewhat over a year. He was subsequently sent to the American College in Strasbourg, Germany, for three years. This was a small private school under the direction of Professor Goss, who organized it as a school principally for American boys on the model of the German Gymnasia. It was a good school, with rigid standards and discipline. In this school Kurt was steeped in the German language and in German cultural patterns. Strasbourg had its own opera and symphony orchestra. Kurt was naturally devoted to music throughout his life, and in his formative years at this school became intimately acquainted with the whole classical repertoire.\n\u201cAt the age of nineteen he was well prepared in a solid foundation of secondary education, and was admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied architecture and took his degree of Bachelor of Science in 1908\u2014the year in which his father died. He then went with his widowed mother and his sister, Irma, to Berlin, and continued his architectural studies with the best masters. He returned to Indianapolis in 1910, and joined his father\u2019s surviving partner, Arthur Bohn, in the well-established firm of Vonnegut & Bohn. He was thus launched upon what promised to be a comfortable and successful career. His family had a prominent position in the community. They had plenty of money.", 0.19009875541125537], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["pictures", 0.0684931506849315], ["verne", 0.0547945205479452], ["girl", 0.0410958904109589], ["girls", 0.0410958904109589], ["picture", 0.0410958904109589], ["pin", 0.0273972602739726], ["cummerbunds", 0.0273972602739726], ["sick", 0.0273972602739726], ["pretty", 0.0273972602739726], ["big", 0.0273972602739726], ["penthouse", 0.0136986301369863], ["affectionate", 0.0136986301369863], ["kong", 0.0136986301369863], ["middle", 0.0136986301369863], ["magazines", 0.0136986301369863], ["likes", 0.0136986301369863], ["foreign", 0.0136986301369863], ["thinks", 0.0136986301369863], ["loudspeaker", 0.0136986301369863], ["naked", 0.0136986301369863], ["hong", 0.0136986301369863], ["pardon", 0.0136986301369863], ["bottom", 0.0136986301369863], ["spends", 0.0136986301369863], ["bottled", 0.0136986301369863], ["choose", 0.0136986301369863], ["cars", 0.0136986301369863], ["girlie", 0.0136986301369863], ["swell", 0.0136986301369863], ["nice", 0.0136986301369863], ["real", 0.0136986301369863], ["play", 0.0136986301369863], ["buy", 0.0136986301369863], ["dope", 0.0136986301369863], ["dates", 0.0136986301369863], ["resent", 0.0136986301369863], ["bachelor", 0.0136986301369863], ["baby", 0.0136986301369863], ["armloads", 0.0136986301369863], ["decorating", 0.0136986301369863], ["realer", 0.0136986301369863], ["white", 0.0136986301369863], ["articles", 0.0136986301369863], ["kind", 0.0136986301369863], ["fortune", 0.0136986301369863], ["wife", 0.0136986301369863], ["inside", 0.0136986301369863], ["married", 0.0136986301369863], ["slavery", 0.0136986301369863], ["sells", 0.0136986301369863], ["believes", 0.0136986301369863], ["looked", 0.0136986301369863], ["magazine", 0.0136986301369863], ["stuff", 0.0136986301369863], ["alike", 0.0136986301369863]], "sentiment": ["A: I don\u2019t resent it. It just seems kind of sick to me.\nQ: Sick?\nA: Girlie pictures are like dope to Verne. I mean, anybody likes to look at pin-up pictures off and on, but Verne, he has to buy armloads of them. He spends a fortune on them, and they\u2019re realer than anything real to him. When it says at the bottom of a pin-up picture, \u201cCome play with me, Baby,\u201d or something like that, Verne believes it. He really thinks the girl is saying that to him.\nQ: He\u2019s married?\nA: To a nice, pretty, affectionate girl. He\u2019s got a swell-looking wife at home. It isn\u2019t as though he\u2019s bottled up in the Y.M.C.A.\nQ: There is never anything else in the magazines besides pictures of girls?\nA: Oh sure\u2014there\u2019s other stuff. Haven\u2019t you ever looked inside one?\nQ: I\u2019m asking you.\nA: They\u2019re all pretty much alike. They all have at least one big picture of a naked girl, usually right in the middle. That\u2019s what sells the magazine, is that big picture.

was unable to get a decent job anywhere, despite all the high posts I had held in government, despite all the important people I knew, it was Ruth who rescued our unpopular little family out in Chevy Chase. She began with two failures, which depressed her at first, but which would later make her laugh so hard that tears streamed from her eyes. Her first failure was as a piano player in a cocktail lounge. The proprietor, when he fired her, told her that she was too good, that his particular clientele \u201c\u2026 didn\u2019t appreciate the finer things in life.\u201d Her second failure was as a wedding photographer. There was always an air of prewar doom about her photographs, which no retoucher would eradicate. It was as though the entire wedding party would wind up in the trenches or the gas chambers by and by.\nBut then she became an interior decorator, beguiling prospective clients with watercolors of rooms she would like to do for them. And I was her clumsy assistant, hanging draperies, holding wallpaper samples against a wall, taking telephone messages from clients, running errands, picking up swatches of this and that\u2014and on and on. I set fire to eleven hundred dollars\u2019 worth of blue velvet draperies one time. No wonder my son never respected me.\nWhen did he ever have a chance to?\nMy God\u2014there his mother was, trying to support the family, and scrimping and saving to get by. And there his unemployed father was, always in the way and helpless, and finally setting fire to a fortune in draperies with a cigarette!\nHooray for a Harvard education! Oh, to be the proud son of a Harvard man!\nRuth was a tiny woman, incidentally\u2014with coppery skin and straight black hair and high cheekbones and deep-set eyes. The first time I laid eyes on her, which was in Nuremberg, Germany, in late August of Nineteen-hundred and Forty-five, she was wearing voluminous army fatigues, and I mistook her for a Gypsy boy. I was a civilian employee of the Defense Department, thirty-two years old. I had never married. I had been a civilian all through the war, often exercising more real power than generals or admirals. Now I was in Nuremberg, ogling the wreckage of war for the first time. I had been sent over to oversee the feeding and housing of the American, British, French, and Russian delegations to the War Crimes Trials. I had previously set up recuperation centers for American soldiers in various resort areas in the United States, so I knew a little something about the hotel trade.\nI was to be a dictator to the Germans as far as food and drink and beds were considered. My official vehicle was a white Mercedes touring car, a four-door convertible with a windshield for the backseat as well as the front. It had a siren. It had little sockets on its front fenders for flags. I of course flew American flags. This dreamboat, as young people might call it, had been an anniversary present from Heinrich Himmler, the creator of concentration camps, to his wife in the good old days. Wherever I went, I had an armed chauffeur. My father, remember, had been a millionaire\u2019s armed chauffeur.\nAnd I was being driven down the main street, the K\u00f6nigstrasse, one August afternoon. The War Crimes Tribunal was meeting in Berlin but was going to move to Nuremberg as soon as I could get things ready there. The street was still blocked by rubble here and there. It was being cleared away by German prisoners of war, who labored, as it happened, under the smoldering gazes of black American military policemen. The American Army was still segregated in those days. Every unit was all black or all white, except for the officers, who were usually white in any case. I do not recall having felt that there was anything odd in this scheme. I knew nothing about black people. There had been no black people on the household staff of the McCone mansion in Cleveland, no black people in my schools. Not even when I was a communist had I had a black person for a friend.\nNear Saint Martha\u2019s Church on the K\u00f6nigstrasse, which had had its roof burned off by a firebomb, my Mercedes was halted at a security checkpoint. It was manned by white American Military Police. They were looking for people who were not where they were supposed to be, now that civilization was being started up again.

When he heard that I was writing a book about the day of the bomb, he told me what the day had been like for him, what the day had been like in the very bar in which we sat. He had a W.C. Fields twang and a nose like a prize strawberry.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Cape Cod Room then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have all these fugging nets and seashells around. It was called the Navajo Tepee in those days. Had Indian blankets and cow skulls on the walls. Had little tom-toms on the tables. People were supposed to beat on the tom-toms when they wanted service. They tried to get me to wear a war bonnet, but I wouldn\u2019t do it. Real Navajo Indian came in here one day; told me Navajos didn\u2019t live in tepees. \u2018That\u2019s a fugging shame,\u2019 I told him. Before that it was the Pompeii Room, with busted plaster all over the place; but no matter what they call the room, they never change the fugging light fixtures. Never change the fugging people who come in or the fugging town outside, either. The day they dropped Hoenikker\u2019s fugging bomb on the Japanese a bum came in and tried to scrounge a drink. He wanted me to give him a drink on account of the world was coming to an end. So I mixed him an \u2018End of the World Delight.\u2019 I gave him about a half-pint of cr\u00e8me de menthe in a hollowed-out pineapple, with whipped cream and a cherry on top. \u2018There, you pitiful son of a bitch,\u2019 I said to him, \u2018don\u2019t ever say I never did anything for you.\u2019 Another guy came in, and he said he was quitting his job at the Research Laboratory; said anything a scientist worked on was sure to wind up as a weapon, one way or another. Said he didn\u2019t want to help politicians with their fugging wars anymore. Name was Breed. I asked him if he was any relation to the boss of the fugging Research Laboratory. He said he fugging well was. Said he was the boss of the Research Laboratory\u2019s fugging son.\u201d\n13\nTHE JUMPING-OFF PLACE\nAH, GOD, what an ugly city Ilium is!", 0.06978438228438229], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["mind", 0.037037037037037035], ["people", 0.037037037037037035], ["tie", 0.037037037037037035], ["swearing", 0.018518518518518517], ["links", 0.018518518518518517], ["striking", 0.018518518518518517], ["hangovers", 0.018518518518518517], ["goddamn", 0.018518518518518517], ["coming", 0.018518518518518517], ["alive", 0.018518518518518517], ["years", 0.018518518518518517], ["held", 0.018518518518518517], ["mistakes", 0.018518518518518517], ["promise", 0.018518518518518517], ["bed", 0.018518518518518517], ["year", 0.018518518518518517], ["messy", 0.018518518518518517], ["hell", 0.018518518518518517], ["socks", 0.018518518518518517], ["shirt", 0.018518518518518517], ["things", 0.018518518518518517], ["ideas", 0.018518518518518517], ["machine", 0.018518518518518517], ["feel", 0.018518518518518517], ["live", 0.018518518518518517], ["going", 0.018518518518518517], ["tuxedo", 0.018518518518518517], ["cuff", 0.018518518518518517], ["darling", 0.018518518518518517], ["primly", 0.018518518518518517], ["foreman", 0.018518518518518517], ["life", 0.018518518518518517], ["business", 0.018518518518518517], ["kroner", 0.018518518518518517], ["hurt", 0.018518518518518517], ["wasn", 0.018518518518518517], ["running", 0.018518518518518517], ["warm", 0.018518518518518517], ["lay", 0.018518518518518517], ["hands", 0.018518518518518517], ["month", 0.018518518518518517], ["tired", 0.018518518518518517], ["change", 0.018518518518518517], ["studs", 0.018518518518518517], ["course", 0.018518518518518517], ["fighting", 0.018518518518518517], ["stupid", 0.018518518518518517], ["place", 0.018518518518518517], ["time", 0.018518518518518517], ["making", 0.018518518518518517], ["clothes", 0.018518518518518517]], "sentiment": ["\u201cAnd he\u2019s got a place to live and warm clothes.

She said nothing. Blinking hard and often, she gathered up her things and left.\nFuzz sat down at his desk again, his head in his hands. He listened to Miss Pefko\u2019s fading footfalls, awaited the great, echoing ka-boom that would tell him Francine had left his life forever.\nHe waited and he waited and he waited for the ka-boom. And he supposed, finally, that he had been cheated out of that symbolic sound, that Francine had managed to close the door noiselessly.\nAnd then he heard music.\nThe music Fuzz heard was a recording of a popular song, cheap and foolish. But, turned back on itself by the countless echo chambers of Building 523, the music was mysterious, dreamlike, magical.\nFuzz followed the music upstairs. He found its source, a large phonograph set against one wall of the gym. He smiled bleakly. The music, then, had been a little farewell present from Francine.\nHe let the record play to the end, and then he turned it off. He sighed, let his gaze travel over the decorations and playthings.\nIf he had raised his eyes to the level of the balcony, he would have seen that Francine hadn\u2019t left the building yet.

He was also probably the best chess player in the history of the college. But he had no social graces, and probably never would have any, because he found everything about life so frightening.\nI asked him if he had ever heard of a woman about my age in Cincinnati whose name was Mary Alice French.\nHe replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody or anything. Please don\u2019t ever talk to me again. Tell everybody to stop talking to me.\u201d\nI never did find out what he did with all his money, if anything. Somebody said he got married.

I needed a whole new planet or death. Anything would be better than what I had.\nThe exit was blocked by a spectacularly dressed man. He was wholly unlike anyone else in the auditorium. He was, incredibly, what I myself would become: a Lieutenant Colonel in the Regular Army, with many rows of ribbons on his chest. He was in full-dress uniform, with a gold citation cord and paratrooper\u2019s wings and boots. We were not then at war anywhere, so the sight of a military man all dolled up like that among civilians, especially so early in the day, was startling. He had been sent there to recruit budding young scientists for his alma mater, the United States Military Academy at West Point.\nThe Academy had been founded soon after the Revolutionary War because the country had so few military officers with mathematical and engineering skills essential to victories in what was modern warfare way back then, mainly mapmaking and cannonballs. Now, with radar and rockets and airplanes and nuclear weapons and all the rest of it, the same problem had come up again.\nAnd there I was in Cleveland, with a great big round badge pinned over my heart like a target, which said:EXHIBITOR.", 0.14912569573283863], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["place", 0.05454545454545454], ["yessir", 0.03636363636363636], ["woman", 0.03636363636363636], ["tall", 0.03636363636363636], ["ad", 0.01818181818181818], ["office", 0.01818181818181818], ["somberly", 0.01818181818181818], ["mine", 0.01818181818181818], ["years", 0.01818181818181818], ["jump", 0.01818181818181818], ["held", 0.01818181818181818], ["paper", 0.01818181818181818], ["directly", 0.01818181818181818], ["imaginary", 0.01818181818181818], ["standing", 0.01818181818181818], ["handkerchief", 0.01818181818181818], ["stables", 0.01818181818181818], ["haired", 0.01818181818181818], ["gentleman", 0.01818181818181818], ["clipped", 0.01818181818181818], ["pam", 0.01818181818181818], ["minor", 0.01818181818181818], ["sagging", 0.01818181818181818], ["handing", 0.01818181818181818], ["patient", 0.01818181818181818], ["returning", 0.01818181818181818], ["usable", 0.01818181818181818], ["attention", 0.01818181818181818], ["headwaiter", 0.01818181818181818], ["pocket", 0.01818181818181818], ["dressed", 0.01818181818181818], ["functionary", 0.01818181818181818], ["ma", 0.01818181818181818], ["suck", 0.01818181818181818], ["hurty", 0.01818181818181818], ["pool", 0.01818181818181818], ["man", 0.01818181818181818], ["shoulder", 0.01818181818181818], ["gray", 0.01818181818181818], ["soiled", 0.01818181818181818], ["joined", 0.01818181818181818], ["morning", 0.01818181818181818], ["doorway", 0.01818181818181818], ["horizon", 0.01818181818181818], ["gut", 0.01818181818181818], ["hung", 0.01818181818181818], ["swimming", 0.01818181818181818], ["fallen", 0.01818181818181818], ["order", 0.01818181818181818], ["left", 0.01818181818181818]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to be patient.
