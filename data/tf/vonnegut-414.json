Surprise, surprise, an extended family, as essential to human health as food.\nIf you want to fatten your essay some, why not write about the fantastic growth of Christianity in a Roman Empire which was so cruelly opposed to it. The state religion formed crowds of strangers to propitiate gods in enormous buildings or plazas. Christians prayed with cozy little bunches of friends who met regularly in cozy little places, which felt much better. The mottos of both Christian and Jewish congregations in those days might have been this: \u201cReligion on a Human Scale.\u201d And never mind fighting or reproducing.\nCheers\u2014\nKurt\nMarch 6, 2001\n[Northampton, MA]\nTO KNOX BURGER\nPresident Clinton granted most of his 140 presidential pardons on his last day in office.\nDear Knox\u2014", -0.028749999999999998], "title": "Letters"}}
