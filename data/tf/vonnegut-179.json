I still had three hours to go. I went upstairs and told a policeman that there was a dead shopping-bag lady in the basement.\nHis duties had made him cynical. He said to me, \u201cSo what else is new?\u201d\nSo I stood by the body of my old friend in the basement until the ambulance attendants came, just as any other faithful animal would have done. It took a while, since it was known that she was dead. She was stiffening up when they got there. They commented on that. I had to ask them what they had just said, since they did not speak in English. It turned out that their first language was Urdu. They were both from Pakistan. Their English was primitive. If Mary Kathleen had died in their presence instead of mine, they would have said, I am sure, that she spoke gibberish at the end.\nI inquired of them, in order to calm the sobs that were welling up inside me, to tell me a little about Urdu. They said it had a literature as great as any in the world, but that it had begun as a spare and ugly artificial language invented in the court of Genghis Khan. Its purpose in the beginning was military. It allowed his captains to give orders that were understood in every part of the Mongol Empire. Poets would later make it beautiful.\nLive and learn.\nI gave the police Mary Kathleen\u2019s maiden name. I gave them my true name as well. I was not about to be cute with the police. Neither was I ready to have anyone learn yet that Mrs. Jack Graham was dead. The consequences of that announcement would surely be an avalanche of some kind.\nI was the only person on the planet who could set it off. I was not ready to set it off yet. This was not cunning on my part, as some people have said. It was my natural awe of an avalanche.\nI walked home, a harmless little elf in his magic dancing shoes, to the Hotel Arapahoe. Much straw had been spun into gold that day, and much gold had been spun into straw. And the spinning had just begun.\nThere was a new night clerk, naturally, since Israel Edel had been summoned to Arpad Leen\u2019s. This new man had been sent over to fill in on short notice. His regular post was behind the desk at the Carlyle, also a RAMJAC hotel. He was exquisitely dressed and groomed. He was mortified, having to deal with whores and people fresh out of jails and lunatic asylums and so on.\nHe had to tell me that: that he really belonged to the Carlyle, and that he was only filling in.

HORNER REDWINE\nIT WAS A TUESDAY AFTERNOON. It was springtime in the northern hemisphere of Earth.\nEarth was green and watery. The air of earth was good to breathe, as fattening as cream.\nThe purity of the rains that fell on Earth could be tasted. The taste of purity was daintily tart.\nEarth was warm.\nThe surface of Earth heaved and seethed in fecund restlessness. Earth was most fertile where the most death was.\nThe daintily tart rain fell on a green place where there was a great deal of death. It fell on a New World country churchyard. The churchyard was in West Barnstable, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, U.S.A. The churchyard was full, the spaces between its naturally dead chinked tight by the bodies of the honored war dead. Martians and Earthlings lay side by side.\nThere was not a country in the world that did not have graveyards with Earthlings and Martians buried side by side.
