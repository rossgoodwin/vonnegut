I was mildly surprised, then, that he could quote Shakespeare. I asked if he had committed a lot of that remarkable author\u2019s words to memory. He said, \u201cYes, dear colleague, including a single sentence which describes life as lived by human beings so completely that no writer after him need ever have written another word.\u201d\n\u201cWhich sentence was that, Mr. Trout?\u201d I asked.\nAnd he said, \u201c \u2018All the world\u2019s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\u2019 \u201d\n11\nI wrote a letter to an old friend last spring about why I evidently couldn\u2019t write publishable fiction anymore, after trying and failing to do that for many years. He is Edward Muir, a poet and advertising man my age living in Scars-dale. In my novel Cat\u2019s Cradle, I say that anybody whose life keeps tangling up with yours for no logical reason is likely a member of your karass, a team God has formed to get something done for Him. Ed Muir is surely a member of my karass.\nListen to this: When I was at the University of Chicago after World War Two, Ed was there, although we did not meet. When I went to Schenectady, New York, to be a publicist for the General Electric Company, Ed went there to be a teacher at Union College. When I quit GE and moved to Cape Cod, he showed up there as a recruiter for the Great Books Program. At last we met, and whether in the service of God or not, my first wife Jane and I became leaders of a Great Books group.\nAnd when he took an advertising job in Boston, so did I, not knowing he had done that. When Ed\u2019s first marriage broke up, so did mine, and now we\u2019re both in New York. My point, though, is as follows: When I sent him a letter about my case of writer\u2019s block, he made it look like a poem and returned it.\nHe left off my salutation and the first few lines, which were in praise of Reader\u2019s Block by David Markson, who had been his student at Union College. I said David shouldn\u2019t thank Fate for letting him write such a good book in a time when large numbers of people could no longer be wowed by a novel, no matter how excellent. Something like that. I don\u2019t have a copy of my letter as prose. As a poem, though, this is its appearance:\nAnd no thanks to Fate.\nWhen we\u2019re gone, there won\u2019t be anybody", 0.20168614718614722], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["nancy", 0.04424778761061947], ["sheriff", 0.035398230088495575], ["hostesses", 0.035398230088495575], ["suicide", 0.02654867256637168], ["billy", 0.02654867256637168], ["poet", 0.02654867256637168], ["mary", 0.02654867256637168], ["karate", 0.02654867256637168], ["ethical", 0.017699115044247787], ["scared", 0.017699115044247787], ["long", 0.017699115044247787], ["distance", 0.017699115044247787], ["sentence", 0.008849557522123894], ["find", 0.008849557522123894], ["police", 0.008849557522123894], ["degrees", 0.008849557522123894], ["rosy", 0.008849557522123894], ["easy", 0.008849557522123894], ["smile", 0.008849557522123894], ["poised", 0.008849557522123894], ["women", 0.008849557522123894], ["worth", 0.008849557522123894], ["plump", 0.008849557522123894], ["pretending", 0.008849557522123894], ["advanced", 0.008849557522123894], ["parlors", 0.008849557522123894], ["die", 0.008849557522123894], ["truth", 0.008849557522123894], ["glassy", 0.008849557522123894], ["girl", 0.008849557522123894], ["psychology", 0.008849557522123894], ["ways", 0.008849557522123894], ["burned", 0.008849557522123894], ["told", 0.008849557522123894], ["full", 0.008849557522123894], ["turning", 0.008849557522123894], ["smartest", 0.008849557522123894], ["step", 0.008849557522123894], ["struggle", 0.008849557522123894], ["great", 0.008849557522123894], ["couldn", 0.008849557522123894], ["changed", 0.008849557522123894], ["chop", 0.008849557522123894], ["thing", 0.008849557522123894], ["feet", 0.008849557522123894], ["virgins", 0.008849557522123894], ["guess", 0.008849557522123894], ["service", 0.008849557522123894], ["angry", 0.008849557522123894], ["system", 0.008849557522123894], ["virgin", 0.008849557522123894], ["bored", 0.008849557522123894], ["today", 0.008849557522123894], ["head", 0.008849557522123894], ["offering", 0.008849557522123894], ["protect", 0.008849557522123894], ["hold", 0.008849557522123894], ["true", 0.008849557522123894], ["sniff", 0.008849557522123894], ["keeping", 0.008849557522123894], ["judo", 0.008849557522123894], ["mcluhan", 0.008849557522123894], ["boring", 0.008849557522123894], ["specializes", 0.008849557522123894], ["chin", 0.008849557522123894], ["closing", 0.008849557522123894], ["shook", 0.008849557522123894], ["nursing", 0.008849557522123894], ["metric", 0.008849557522123894], ["heard", 0.008849557522123894], ["experts", 0.008849557522123894], ["helpless", 0.008849557522123894], ["looked", 0.008849557522123894], ["laughed", 0.008849557522123894], ["panic", 0.008849557522123894], ["fuss", 0.008849557522123894], ["hand", 0.008849557522123894], ["meaning", 0.008849557522123894], ["mad", 0.008849557522123894], ["america", 0.008849557522123894], ["adopt", 0.008849557522123894], ["thought", 0.008849557522123894], ["edge", 0.008849557522123894], ["absurd", 0.008849557522123894], ["tall", 0.008849557522123894], ["backward", 0.008849557522123894], ["pulled", 0.008849557522123894], ["order", 0.008849557522123894], ["deflowering", 0.008849557522123894]], "sentiment": ["\"I thought that was all anybody did know about Billy the Poet: that he specializes in deflowering Hostesses in Ethical Suicide Parlors.\" Nancy was a virgin.

He was wearing a sweater and slacks, and he promised Felix yet again that he simply wanted to catch a glimpse of this girl, and that he wasn\u2019t going to put on any kind of a show for her. It was all going to be very ordinary and brief, and even boring.\nAbout the automobile: It was a Keedsler touring car, manufactured right in Midland City in 1932, when a Keedsler was in every respect the equal or the superior of a German Mercedes or a British Rolls-Royce. It was a bizarre and glorious antique even in 1943. Felix had put the top down. There was a separate windshield for the back seat. The engine had sixteen cylinders, and the two spare tires were mounted in shallow wells in the front fenders. The tires looked like the necks of plunging horses.\nSo Felix burbled off toward the black part of town in that flabbergasting apparatus. He was wearing a rented tuxedo, with a gardenia in his lapel. There was a corsage of two orchids for Celia on the seat beside him.\nFather stripped down to his underwear, and Mother brought him the uniform. She was in on this double cross of Felix. She thought everything Father did was wonderful. And while Father was getting dressed again, she went around turning off electric lights and lighting candles. She and Father, without anybody\u2019s much noticing it, had earlier in the day put candles everywhere. There must have been a hundred of them.\nMother got them all lit, just about the time Father topped off his scarlet-and-silver uniform with the busby.\nAnd I myself, standing on the balcony outside my bedroom on the loft, was as enchanted as Mother and Father expected Celia Hildreth to be. I was inside a great beehive filled with fireflies. And below me was the beautiful King of the Early Evening.\nMy mind had been trained by heirloom books of fairy tales, and by the myths and legends which animated my father\u2019s conversation, to think that way. It was second nature for me, and for Felix, too, and for no other children in Midland City, I am sure, to see candle flames as fireflies\u2014and to invent a King of the Early Evening.\nAnd now the King of the Early Evening, with a purple plume in his busby, gave this order: \u201cOpe, ope the portals!\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhat portals were there to open? There were only two, I thought. There was the front door on the south, and there was the kitchen door on the northeast.

"sentiment": ["Mr. Banghart seemed soothed by the devotional atmosphere. He picked up two hymnals from a shelf along the wall, handed one to Haley, and burst into song with startling volume and brilliance. The young man directing the singing stared with surprise and gratitude, and his unwashed congregation turned their heads to squint in wonder.\n\u201cWelcome, brother,\u201d said the young man at the end of the hymn. Mr. Banghart stood up, proud and poised, and bowed to the young man and then to the congregation. \u201cI would now like to sing \u2018Throw Out the Lifeline,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said the young man happily. \u201cLet\u2019s all turn to number 29.\u201d\nA short, stocky youth, wearing the threadbare remnants of an Army uniform, turned around in his seat on the bench in front of Haley and said in a loud hiss to Mr. Banghart, \u201cShut up, Buster, and sit down, or we\u2019ll never get anything to eat.\u201d\nMr. Banghart stopped his singing abruptly in mid-chorus, leaving only the reedy tenor of the leader and the apathetic murmur of the others to carry on. \u201cI would appreciate an apology,\u201d he said coldly.\n\u201cGo to hell,\u201d said the youth, giving him an ugly grin. His two companions turned to sneer menacingly. The singing stopped completely.\nHaley saw a look of fear pass over Mr. Banghart\u2019s features and then heard him shout wildly, \u201cIt\u2019s a trap! They\u2019re out to get us!\u201d Mr. Banghart smashed his hard, massive fist into the youth\u2019s insolent face, catapulting him over the bench and onto the floor.\n\u201cStop it!\u201d cried the young man behind the pulpit.\nThe youth rose from the floor, and he and his two companions started toward Haley and Mr. Banghart. Haley raised his frail hands in a gesture of defense as one of them singled him out and charged. The blow of a fist on his temple spun him around. He sank to his knees and looked up, stunned and frightened. He blinked dully at the flash of light from Mr. Banghart\u2019s knife, heard a scream, and was knocked senseless by another blow from behind.\nThe scuffling and shouts dropped away from him as the din of a city drops away from a soaring balloon. The glint of the knife became the beam of a flashlight, playing on the buff walls of the secret room hollowed in hay bales in the loft. The beam lighted the round face of the General, reflecting from the lenses of his glasses so that his eyes could not be seen. \u201cHaley,\u201d intoned the General\u2019s image, \u201cyou have been nothing but a burden since I took you into my home.

Two was all we wanted back \u2014 this one and Kitty.\u201d Annie yawned and rubbed her eyes.

The General\u2019s got enough guns for a regiment \u2014 all loaded.\u201d\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d laughed the trooper; \u201cjust don\u2019t go pot-shotting everything that moves.

She thanked the trooper for his trouble, and marched the sullen Haley into the sunroom. Haley was repeating to himself the speech he had prepared during the long trip back from Chicago.\nThe General did not look up when Haley walked into his presence. He was wearing an oily undershirt and khaki trousers, and was swabbing the cavernous bore of a single-barreled duck gun. Haley looked about the room and saw that every surface was cluttered with firearms and ammunition. \u201cSir,\u201d Haley began, \u201cI guess we\u2019ve both been pretty childish, and I, for one, am

Brass buttons flew like popcorn. The corporal reached into Weary\u2019s gaping bosom as though he meant to tear out his pounding heart, but he brought out Weary\u2019s bulletproof Bible instead.\nA bullet-proof Bible is a Bible small enough to be slipped into a soldier\u2019s breast pocket, over his heart. It is sheathed in steel.\nThe corporal found the dirty picture of the woman and the pony in Weary\u2019s hip pocket. \u201cWhat a lucky pony, eh?\u201d he said. \u201cHmmmm? Hmmmm? Don\u2019t you wish you were that pony?\u201d He handed the picture to the other old man. \u201cSpoils of war! It\u2019s yours, all yours, you lucky lad.\u201d\nThen he made Weary sit down in the snow and take off his combat boots, which he gave to the beautiful boy. He gave Weary the boy\u2019s clogs. So Weary and Billy were both without decent military footwear now, and they had to walk for miles and miles, with Weary\u2019s clogs clacking, with Billy bobbing up-and-down, up-and-down, crashing into Weary from time to time.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Billy would say, or \u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d\nThey were brought at last to a stone cottage at a fork in the road. It was a collecting point for prisoners of war. Billy and Weary were taken inside, where it was warm and smoky. There was a fire sizzling and popping in the fireplace. The fuel was furniture. There were about twenty other Americans in there, sitting on the floor with their backs to the wall, staring into the flames\u2014thinking whatever there was to think, which was zero.\nNobody talked. Nobody had any good war stories to tell.\nBilly and Weary found places for themselves, and Billy went to sleep with his head on the shoulder of an unprotesting captain. The captain was a chaplain. He was a rabbi. He had been shot through the hand.\nBilly traveled in time, opened his eyes, found himself staring into the glass eyes of a jade green mechanical owl. The owl was hanging upside down from a rod of stainless steel. The owl was Billy\u2019s optometer in his office in Ilium. An optometer is an instrument for measuring refractive errors in eyes\u2014in order that corrective lenses may be prescribed.\nBilly had fallen asleep while examining a female patient who was in a chair on the other side of the owl. He had fallen asleep at work before. It had been funny at first. Now Billy was starting to get worried about it, about his mind in general. He tried to remember how old he was, couldn\u2019t. He tried to remember what year it was.

He was a repairer of solar watches in Boston, and a charming liar.\nA magazine had bought his story for three thousand dollars.\nSitting in Skip\u2019s Museum under the spiral staircase, Winston Niles Rumfoord read Koradubian\u2019s magazine story with delight and admiration. Koradubian claimed in his story that Rumfoord had told him about the year Ten Million A.D.\nIn the year Ten Million, according to Koradubian, there would be a tremendous house-cleaning. All records relating to the period between the death of Christ and the year One Million A.D. would be hauled to dumps and burned. This would be done, said Koradubian, because museums and archives would be crowding the living right off the earth.\nThe million-year period to which the burned junk related would be summed up in history books in one sentence, according to Koradubian: Following the death of Jesus Christ, there was a period of readjustment that lasted for approximately one million years.\nWinston Niles Rumfoord laughed and laid Koradubian\u2019s article aside. Rumfoord loved nothing more than a thumping good fraud. \"Ten Million A.D.\u2014\" he said out loud, \"a great year for fireworks and parades and world\u2019s fairs. A merry time for cracking open cornerstones and digging up time capsules.\"\nRumfoord wasn\u2019t talking to himself.

And celibacy is no root canal. It\u2019s so cheap and convenient. You don\u2019t have to do or say anything afterwards, because there is no afterwards.\nAnd when my tantrum, which is what I call my TV set, flashes boobs and smiles in my face, and says everybody but me is going to get laid tonight, and this is a national emergency, so I\u2019ve got to rush out and buy a car or pills, or a folding gymnasium I can hide under my bed, I laugh like a hyena. I know and you know that millions and millions of good Americans, present company not excepted, are not going to get laid tonight.\nAnd we flaming neuters vote! So I am looking forward to the day when the President of the United States, no less, who probably isn\u2019t going to get laid that night, declares a National Neuter Pride Day.

She knew I was sappy, too, a Franklin Roosevelt Democrat, a friend of the working stiffs. She was about to have a baby, not mine. She wanted to know if it was a mistake to bring an innocent little baby into a world as awful as this one is. I told her that what made life almost worth living for me was the saints I met. These were people who behaved compassionately and capably, no matter what, and they could be anywhere.\nSo maybe some of you tonight are or may became saints for her child to meet. Most of us are loaded with Original Sin. But a surprising number of us, not me, God knows, are loaded with Original Virtue. Ain\u2019t that sweet?\nSo now it\u2019s time for me to teach creative writing.\nFirst rule: Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites, representing nothing.

sure, I had, while in Washington, \u201cmade love,\u201d as they say, to this woman or that one from time to time. There was a WAC. There was a Navy nurse. There was a stenographer in the Department of Commerce typing pool. But I was fundamentally a fanatical monk in the service of war, war, war. There were many like me. Nothing else in life is nearly so obsessive as war, war, war.\nMy wedding gift to Ruth was a wood carving commissioned by me. It depicted hands of an old person pressed together in prayer. It was a three-dimensional rendering of a drawing by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a sixteenth-century artist, whose house Ruth and I had visited many times in Nuremberg, during our courting days. That was my invention, so far as I know, having those famous hands on paper rendered in the round. Such hands have since been manufactured by the millions and are staples of dim-witted piety in gift shops everywhere.\nSoon after our marriage I was transferred to Wiesbaden, Germany, outside of Frankfurt am Main, where I was placed in charge of a team of civilian engineers, which was winnowing mountains of captured German technical documents for inventions and manufacturing methods and trade secrets American industry might use. It did not matter that I knew no math or chemistry or physics\u2014any more than it had mattered when I went to work for the Department of Agriculture that I had never been near a farm, that I had not even tended a pot of African violets on a windowsill. There was nothing that a humanist could not supervise\u2014or so it was widely believed at the time.\nOur son was born by cesarean section in Wiesbaden. Ben Shapiro, who had been my best man, and who had also been transferred to Wiesbaden, delivered the child. He had just been promoted to full colonel. In a few years Senator Joseph R. McCarthy would find that promotion to have been sinister, since it was well known that Shapiro had been a communist before the war. \u201cWho promoted Shapiro to Wiesbaden?\u201d he would want to know.\nWe named our son Walter F. Starbuck, Jr. Little did we dream that the name would become as onerous as Judas Iscariot, Jr., to the boy. He would seek legal remedy when he turned twenty-one, would have his name changed to Walter F. Stankiewicz, the name that appears over his columns in The New York Times. Stankiewicz, of course, was our discarded family name. And I must laugh now, remembering something my father once told me about his arrival at Ellis Island as an immigrant. He was advised that Stankiewicz had unpleasant connotations to American ears, that people would think he smelled bad, even if he sat in a bathtub all day long.\nI returned to the United States with my little human family, to Washington, D.C., again, in the autumn of Nineteen-hundred and Forty-nine. My optimism became bricks and mortar and wood and nails. We bought the only house we would ever own, which was the little bungalow in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Ruth put on the mantelpiece the woodcarving of the praying hands by Albrecht D\u00fcrer. There were two things that had made her want to buy that house and no other, she said. One was that it had a perfect resting place for the hands. The other was a gnarled old tree that shaded the walk to our doorstep. It was a flowering crab apple tree.\nWas she religious? No. She was from a family that was skeptical about all formal forms of worship, which was classified as Jewish by the Nazis. Its members would not have so classified themselves. I asked her once if she had ever sought the consolations of religion in the concentration camp.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew God would never come near such a place. So did the Nazis. That was what made them so hilarious and unafraid. That was the strength of the Nazis,\u201d she said. \u201cThey understood God better than anyone.

He couldn\u2019t draw for sour apples. He had to tell me that the bride and groom were rhinoceroses. I thought they were a couple of sofas maybe, or maybe a couple of smashed-up sedans. That would have been fairly funny, come to think of it: 2 smashed-up sedans taking wedding vows. They were going to settle down.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s funny about it?\u201d said Jack incredulously. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sense of humor? If somebody doesn\u2019t stop the wedding, those two will mate and have a baby rhinoceros.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cFor Pete\u2019s sake,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat could be uglier and dumber than a rhinoceros? Just because something can reproduce, that doesn\u2019t mean it should reproduce.\u201d\nI pointed out that to a rhinoceros another rhinoceros was wonderful.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery kind of animal thinks its own kind of animal is wonderful. So people getting married think they\u2019re wonderful, and that they\u2019re going to have a baby that\u2019s wonderful, when actually they\u2019re as ugly as rhinoceroses. Just because we think we\u2019re so wonderful doesn\u2019t mean we really are. We could be really terrible animals and just never admit it because it would hurt so much.\u201d\nDURING JACK\u2019S AND my cow year at the Point, I remember, which would have been our junior year at a regular college, we were ordered to walk a tour for 3 hours on the Quadrangle, in a military manner, as though on serious guard duty, in full uniform and carrying rifles. This was punishment for our having failed to report another cadet who had cheated on a final examination in Electrical Engineering. The Honor Code required not only that we never lie or cheat but that we snitch on anybody who had done those things.\nWe hadn\u2019t seen the cadet cheat. We hadn\u2019t even been in the same class with him. But we were with him, along with one other cadet, when he got drunk in Philadelphia after the Army-Navy game. He got so drunk he confessed that he had cheated on the exam the previous June. Jack and I told him to shut up, that we didn\u2019t want to hear about it, and that we were going to forget about it, since it probably wasn\u2019t true anyway.\nBut the other cadet, who would later be fragged in Vietnam, turned all of us in. We were as corrupt as the cheater, supposedly, for trying to cover up for him. \u201cFragging,\u201d incidentally, was a new word in the English language that came out of the Vietnam War. It meant pitching a fizzing fragmentation grenade into the sleeping quarters of an unpopular officer. I don\u2019t mean to boast, but the whole time I was in Vietnam nobody offered to frag me.\nThe cheater was thrown out, even though he was a firstie, which meant he would graduate in only 6 more months. And Jack and I had to walk a 3-hour tour at night and in an ice-cold rain. We weren\u2019t supposed to talk to each other or to anyone. But the nonsensical posts he and I had to march intersected at 1 point. Jack muttered to me at one such meeting, \u201cWhat would you do if you heard somebody had just dropped an atom bomb on New York City?\u201d\nIt would be 10 minutes before we passed again. I thought of a few answers that were obvious, such as that I would be horrified, I would want to cry, and so on. But I understood that he didn\u2019t want to hear my answer. Jack wanted me to hear his answer.", 0.060426767676767676], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["hurty", 0.057971014492753624], ["lied", 0.028985507246376812], ["mind", 0.028985507246376812], ["colonel", 0.028985507246376812], ["point", 0.014492753623188406], ["horses", 0.014492753623188406], ["people", 0.014492753623188406], ["feel", 0.014492753623188406], ["carrots", 0.014492753623188406], ["number", 0.014492753623188406], ["feature", 0.014492753623188406], ["course", 0.014492753623188406], ["episodes", 0.014492753623188406], ["expect", 0.014492753623188406], ["throat", 0.014492753623188406], ["earth", 0.014492753623188406], ["liking", 0.014492753623188406], ["wander", 0.014492753623188406], ["roots", 0.014492753623188406], ["sell", 0.014492753623188406], ["living", 0.014492753623188406], ["guess", 0.014492753623188406], ["feeding", 0.014492753623188406], ["handled", 0.014492753623188406], ["puzzled", 0.014492753623188406], ["loosening", 0.014492753623188406], ["legal", 0.014492753623188406], ["better", 0.014492753623188406], ["going", 0.014492753623188406], ["fidgeting", 0.014492753623188406], ["pool", 0.014492753623188406], ["butler", 0.014492753623188406], ["interested", 0.014492753623188406], ["peckhams", 0.014492753623188406], ["sort", 0.014492753623188406], ["plants", 0.014492753623188406], ["lan", 0.014492753623188406], ["offer", 0.014492753623188406], ["labyrinth", 0.014492753623188406], ["join", 0.014492753623188406], ["drowsing", 0.014492753623188406], ["brandy", 0.014492753623188406], ["sun", 0.014492753623188406], ["bit", 0.014492753623188406], ["cleared", 0.014492753623188406], ["recapture", 0.014492753623188406], ["room", 0.014492753623188406], ["newness", 0.014492753623188406], ["received", 0.014492753623188406], ["swimming", 0.014492753623188406], ["locked", 0.014492753623188406], ["ahead", 0.014492753623188406], ["lost", 0.014492753623188406], ["study", 0.014492753623188406], ["official", 0.014492753623188406], ["looked", 0.014492753623188406], ["place", 0.014492753623188406], ["afternoon", 0.014492753623188406], ["time", 0.014492753623188406], ["impertinent", 0.014492753623188406], ["property", 0.014492753623188406], ["waited", 0.014492753623188406], ["greenhouse", 0.014492753623188406]], "sentiment": ["Hurty looked to me.\nI cleared my throat. \u201cWell,\u201d I lied, \u201cthere are a number of people very interested in this property, as you might expect.

We was supposed to whoop it up and holler to show how professional we was. But we got out there between them flares, and didn\u2019t hardly nobody let out a peep for fear they\u2019d throw up. We was supposed to advance aggressively, only we couldn\u2019t tell what belonged to us, and what was nineteen-eighteen\u2019s. We\u2019d walk around things that wasn\u2019t there, and fall over things that was there.\nIf I had of been a observer, I would of said we was comical.\nI was the first man in the first squad of the first platoon of that time-screen company, and wasn\u2019t but one man in front of me. He was our noble captain.\nHe only hollered one thing at his fearless troops, and I thought he hollered that to make us even more bloodthirsty than we was. \u201cSo long, Boy Scouts!\u201d he hollered. \u201cWrite your mothers regular, and wipe your noses when they runs!\u201d\nThen he bent over, and he run off across no man\u2019s land as fast as he could go.\nI done my best to stick with him, for the honor of the enlisted men. We was both falling down and getting up like a couple of drunks, just beating ourselves to pieces on that battlefield.\nHe never looked around to see how me and the rest was doing. I thought he didn\u2019t want nobody to see how green he was. I kept trying to tell him we\u2019d done left everbody way behind, but the race took ever bit of breath I had.\nWhen he headed off to one side, towards a line of flares, I figured he wanted to get in the smoke where folks couldn\u2019t see him, so he could get sick in private.\nI had just fell into the smoke after him when a barrage from nineteen-eighteen hit.\nThat poor old world, she rocked and rolled, she spit and tore, she boiled and burned.
