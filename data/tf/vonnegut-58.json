was doing on the afternoon of February 13th, 2001, when the timequake struck. It couldn\u2019t have been much. I sure as heck wasn\u2019t writing another book. I was seventy-eight, for heaven\u2019s sakes! My daughter Lily was eighteen!\nOld Kilgore Trout was still writing, though. Seated on his cot at the shelter, where everybody thought his name was Vincent van Gogh, he had just begun a story about a working-class Londoner, Albert Hardy, also the name of the story. Albert Hardy was born in 1896, with his head between his legs, and his genitalia sprouting out of the top of his neck, which looked \u201clike a zucchini.\u201d\nAlbert\u2019s parents taught him to walk on his hands and eat with his feet. That was so they could conceal his private parts with trousers. The private parts weren\u2019t excessively large like the testicles of the fugitive in Trout\u2019s father\u2019s Ting-a-ling parable. That wasn\u2019t the point.\nMonica Pepper was at her desk next door, only feet away, but they still hadn\u2019t met. She and Dudley Prince and her husband still believed the depositor of stories in the trash receptacle out front was an old woman, so she couldn\u2019t possibly live next door. Their best guess was that she came from the shelter for battered old people over on Convent Avenue, or the detox center in the parish house down at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, which was unisex.\nMonica\u2019s own home, and Zoltan\u2019s, was an apartment down in Turtle Bay, a safe neighborhood seven miles away, comfortingly close to the United Nations. She came and went from work in her own chauffeur-driven limousine, which was modified to accommodate Zoltan\u2019s wheelchair. The Academy was fabulously well-to-do. Money was not a problem. Thanks to lavish gifts from old-fashioned art lovers in the past, it was richer than several members of the United Nations, including, surely, Mali, Swaziland, and Luxembourg.\nZoltan had the limo that afternoon. He was on his way to pick up Monica. She was awaiting Zoltan\u2019s arrival when the timequake struck. He would get as far as ringing the Academy doorbell before he was zapped back to February 17th, 1991.

That can\u2019t feel good. That can\u2019t feel good.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt felt to me then as though my peephole had just opened, and I wasn\u2019t even used to all the sights and sounds yet, but my father had already chopped the top off our house, and everybody was saying I was a killer. This was a planet where everything happened much too fast.\nI could hardly catch my breath.\nBut police headquarters seemed quiet enough. Not much could happen on a Sunday night.\nHow common was it to have a known killer in a cell in Midland City? I had no way of knowing then, but I have since looked up the crime statistics for 1944. A killer was quite a novelty. There were only eight detected homicides of any sort. Three were drunken driving accidents. One was a sober driving accident. One was a fight in a black nightclub. One was a fight in a white bar. One was the shooting of a brother-in-law mistaken for a burglar. And there was Eloise Metzger and me.\nBecause of my age, I could not be prosecuted. Only Father could be prosecuted. Chief Morissey had explained that to me very early in the game\u2014at a time when he thought there was all sorts of hope for both Father and me. So I felt safe, although embarrassed.\nLittle did I know that Morissey had meanwhile concluded that Father and I were dangerous imbeciles, since we seemed determined to confess to far more than was necessary, to inflame the community by seeming almost proud of my having shot Mrs. Metzger. Mrs. Metzger and her survivors were nothing.

Leafing through that treasure house of souvenirs, I find these things to be true:\nThe Reverend Doctor Lionel Jason David Jones, D.D.S., D.D., was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, in 1889, was raised as a Methodist.\nHe was the youngest son of a dentist, the grandson of two dentists, brother of two dentists, and the brother-in-law of three dentists. He himself set out to be a dentist, but was expelled from the Dental School of the University of Pittsburgh in 1910, for what would now be diagnosed, most likely, as paranoia. In 1910, he was dismissed for simple scholastic failure.\nThe syndrome of his failure was anything but simple. His examination papers were quite probably the longest such papers ever written in the history of dental education, and probably the most irrelevant as well. They began, sanely enough, with whatever subject the examination required Jones to discuss. But, regardless of that subject, Jones managed to go from it to a theory that was all his own\u2014that the teeth of Jews and Negroes proved beyond question that both groups were degenerate.\nHis dental work was of a high order, so the faculty hoped to see him outgrow his political interpretations of teeth. But his case grew worse, until his examinations became frantic pamphlets, warning all Protestant Anglo-Saxons to unite against Jewish-Negro domination.\nWhen Jones began to detect proof of degeneracy in the teeth of Catholics and Unitarians, and when five loaded pistols and a bayonet were found under his mattress, Jones was finally given the old heave-ho.", -0.025972222222222226], "title": "Mother

Ash was eighty-eight and in a wheelchair, with a nurse in attendance. He lived and raged in a retirement home one block west of Cutty Sark. Ash had asked to be taken there that night in order to confirm this self-serving opinion: \u201cComedians used to have brains. They don\u2019t anymore. Nothing but sex and toilet jokes.\u201d\nSome surprise at Cutty Sark! Gary Ash found himself thunderstruck by this redheaded college kid in basketball shoes.\nHe didn\u2019t look happy when he accosted Berman, who was sitting at a table, wholly drained, waiting to watch the amateur acts that would follow his. Berman hadn\u2019t a clue as to who Ash was. He had never seen Ash and his partner, Jonathan \u201cBing\u201d Spiegel, or heard them ramble on and on as pseudo-imbeciles about hypocrisies or idiocies in the news that day. Their sign-offs: \u201cThis is Ash, the Dorical of Elphi,\u201d and, \u201cThis is Bingo reminding you: \u2018It\u2019s no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.\u2019\u201d Bing Spiegel had been dead for sixteen years when Gary Ash caught Berman\u2019s act at Cutty Sark. \u201cThey had been man and wife, except for sex and a marriage license.\u201d So said Spiegel\u2019s obituary in the New York Times.\nTo hear Gil Berman tell it: \u201cI was minding my own business when a nurse wheeled this absolutely furious old man in a wheelchair up to me. I didn\u2019t know who he was. The manager of the club had to tell me afterward. And this old geezer snorted and sneered, and then he said, \u2018You have just scared the living piss out of me. Thanks a lot.\u2019\u201d\nBerman didn\u2019t know what to say. Finally, he said, \u201cThe haircut and the shoes?\u201d\nAsh blew up. \u201cFuck the haircut and shoes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat scared me was a pretty face with bushy eyebrows and a voice like God on Doomsday.\u201d\nBerman\u2019s voice, and he was a baritone who had taken voice lessons at Knightsbridge High, could be astonishingly rich and vibrant when he used it at full power. In his performance this night, he had used it, as he would for every subsequent performance in his comedic lifetime, sparingly, startling the audience by suddenly turning it on for a few lines, and then turning it off again. When Berman became famous or infamous, take your choice, a well-known caricaturist complained: \u201cI thought Gil Berman would be easy: a pretty, demonic young thing with a skinhead haircut and bushy eyebrows, and a shirt and tie. But how the heck was I supposed to draw that pipe-organ voice he has, which is half of his persona?\u201d\n\u201cIs it my voice that bothered you?\u201d Berman asked the seething Ash.\nAsh ignored the question. \u201cWhere did you get material like that?\u201d\n\u201cI wrote it myself,\u201d said Berman. \u201cYou thought it was funny?\u201d", 0.06321212121212122], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["billy", 0.05], ["time", 0.05], ["will", 0.041666666666666664], ["free", 0.025], ["pilgrim", 0.025], ["golf", 0.016666666666666666], ["earth", 0.016666666666666666], ["earthlings", 0.016666666666666666], ["amber", 0.016666666666666666], ["bound", 0.016666666666666666], ["putt", 0.016666666666666666], ["three", 0.016666666666666666], ["tralfamadore", 0.016666666666666666], ["moment", 0.016666666666666666], ["tralfamadorian", 0.016666666666666666], ["summer", 0.008333333333333333], ["yellow", 0.008333333333333333], ["foot", 0.008333333333333333], ["chair", 0.008333333333333333], ["find", 0.008333333333333333], ["hadn", 0.008333333333333333], ["explain", 0.008333333333333333], ["blob", 0.008333333333333333], ["meant", 0.008333333333333333], ["wouldn", 0.008333333333333333], ["explainers", 0.008333333333333333], ["optometrists", 0.008333333333333333], ["telling", 0.008333333333333333], ["rocky", 0.008333333333333333], ["course", 0.008333333333333333], ["blazing", 0.008333333333333333], ["morning", 0.008333333333333333], ["miles", 0.008333333333333333], ["explanations", 0.008333333333333333], ["achieved", 0.008333333333333333], ["church", 0.008333333333333333], ["idea", 0.008333333333333333], ["optometrist", 0.008333333333333333], ["avoided", 0.008333333333333333], ["contour", 0.008333333333333333], ["saucer", 0.008333333333333333], ["hacker", 0.008333333333333333], ["chamber", 0.008333333333333333], ["sun", 0.008333333333333333], ["warnings", 0.008333333333333333], ["strapped", 0.008333333333333333], ["hours", 0.008333333333333333], ["change", 0.008333333333333333], ["great", 0.008333333333333333], ["thirty", 0.008333333333333333], ["universe", 0.008333333333333333], ["cup", 0.008333333333333333], ["reports", 0.008333333333333333], ["turn", 0.008333333333333333], ["aboard", 0.008333333333333333], ["flying", 0.008333333333333333], ["simply", 0.008333333333333333], ["wasn", 0.008333333333333333], ["cloud", 0.008333333333333333], ["stretch", 0.008333333333333333], ["structured", 0.008333333333333333], ["white", 0.008333333333333333], ["recovered", 0.008333333333333333], ["mountains", 0.008333333333333333], ["trapped", 0.008333333333333333], ["warp", 0.008333333333333333], ["inhabited", 0.008333333333333333], ["sound", 0.008333333333333333], ["earthling", 0.008333333333333333], ["visited", 0.008333333333333333], ["hacking", 0.008333333333333333], ["studied", 0.008333333333333333], ["bent", 0.008333333333333333], ["momentarily", 0.008333333333333333], ["bugs", 0.008333333333333333], ["middle", 0.008333333333333333], ["dizzy", 0.008333333333333333], ["planets", 0.008333333333333333], ["aged", 0.008333333333333333], ["studying", 0.008333333333333333], ["event", 0.008333333333333333], ["sunday", 0.008333333333333333], ["events", 0.008333333333333333], ["explaining", 0.008333333333333333], ["ball", 0.008333333333333333], ["centuries", 0.008333333333333333], ["lend", 0.008333333333333333], ["strokes", 0.008333333333333333], ["spent", 0.008333333333333333], ["green", 0.008333333333333333], ["playing", 0.008333333333333333], ["talk", 0.008333333333333333]], "sentiment": ["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd then Billy was a middle-aged optometrist again, playing hacker\u2019s golf this time\u2014on a blazing summer Sunday morning. Billy never went to church any more. He was hacking with three other optometrists. Billy was on the green in seven strokes, and it was his turn to putt.\nIt was an eight-foot putt and he made it. He bent over to take the ball out of the cup, and the sun went behind a cloud. Billy was momentarily dizzy. When he recovered, he wasn\u2019t on the golf course any more.

In twelve months, rarely leaving Room 223 in the Wilburhampton Hotel, he increased his fortune to a mil - lion and a quarter.\nNoel Constant did it without genius and without spies.\nHis system was so idiotically simple that some people can\u2019t understand it, no matter how often it is explained. The people who can\u2019t understand it are people who have to believe, for their own peace of mind, that tremendous wealth can be produced only by tremendous cleverness.\nThis was Noel Constant\u2019s system:\nHe took the Gideon Bible that was in his room, and he started with the first sentence in Genesis.\nThe first sentence in Genesis, as some people may know, is: \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\" Noel Constant wrote the sentence in capital letters, put periods between the letters, divided the letters into pairs, rendering the sentence as follows: \"I.N., T.H., E.B., E.G., I.N., N.I., N.G., G.O., D.C., R.E., A.T., E.D., T.H., E.H., E.A., V.E., N.A., N.D., T.H., E.E., A.R., T.H.\"\nAnd then he looked for corporations with those initials, and bought shares in them. His rule at the beginning was that he would own shares in only one corporation at a time, would invest his whole nest-egg in it, and would sell the instant the value of his shares had doubled.", 0.29259259259259257], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "if-this-isnt-nice-what-is": {"tfidf": [["chicago", 0.10526315789473684], ["university", 0.10526315789473684], ["syracuse", 0.05263157894736842], ["economic", 0.02631578947368421], ["1871", 0.02631578947368421], ["barn", 0.02631578947368421], ["scale", 0.02631578947368421], ["credited", 0.02631578947368421], ["illinois", 0.02631578947368421], ["reconstruction", 0.02631578947368421], ["butler", 0.02631578947368421], ["indiana", 0.02631578947368421], ["indianapolis", 0.02631578947368421], ["led", 0.02631578947368421], ["fire", 0.02631578947368421], ["13", 0.02631578947368421], ["kicking", 0.02631578947368421], ["york", 0.02631578947368421], ["folklore", 0.02631578947368421], ["population", 0.02631578947368421], ["leary", 0.02631578947368421], ["great", 0.02631578947368421], ["12", 0.02631578947368421], ["15", 0.02631578947368421], ["14", 0.02631578947368421], ["cow", 0.02631578947368421], ["16", 0.02631578947368421], ["large", 0.02631578947368421], ["growth", 0.02631578947368421], ["starting", 0.02631578947368421], ["lantern", 0.02631578947368421]], "sentiment": ["12 Mrs. O\u2019Leary\u2019s cow is credited in folklore for kicking over a lantern in a barn and starting the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which was followed by large-scale reconstruction that led to new economic and population growth.\n13 The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois\n14 The University of Chicago.\n15 Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York\n16 Butler University, Indianapolis, Indiana", 0.18989898989898993], "title": "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["female", 0.0707070707070707], ["foot", 0.050505050505050504], ["male", 0.050505050505050504], ["mary", 0.04040404040404041], ["raised", 0.030303030303030304], ["fish", 0.030303030303030304], ["blue", 0.030303030303030304], ["looked", 0.030303030303030304], ["beautiful", 0.020202020202020204], ["point", 0.020202020202020204], ["dance", 0.020202020202020204], ["closer", 0.020202020202020204], ["lava", 0.020202020202020204], ["sound", 0.020202020202020204], ["feet", 0.020202020202020204], ["sight", 0.010101010101010102], ["coming", 0.010101010101010102], ["errands", 0.010101010101010102], ["voices", 0.010101010101010102], ["high", 0.010101010101010102], ["bright", 0.010101010101010102], ["paper", 0.010101010101010102], ["meters", 0.010101010101010102], ["alike", 0.010101010101010102], ["wasn", 0.010101010101010102], ["earth", 0.010101010101010102], ["bizarre", 0.010101010101010102], ["air", 0.010101010101010102], ["film", 0.010101010101010102], ["wonder", 0.010101010101010102], ["standing", 0.010101010101010102], ["busy", 0.010101010101010102], ["eye", 0.010101010101010102], ["second", 0.010101010101010102], ["person", 0.010101010101010102], ["caught", 0.010101010101010102], ["spread", 0.010101010101010102], ["materials", 0.010101010101010102], ["pace", 0.010101010101010102], ["interested", 0.010101010101010102], ["speaking", 0.010101010101010102], ["persona", 0.010101010101010102], ["business", 0.010101010101010102], ["separate", 0.010101010101010102], ["hepburn", 0.010101010101010102], ["early", 0.010101010101010102], ["met", 0.010101010101010102], ["game", 0.010101010101010102], ["fan", 0.010101010101010102], ["nesting", 0.010101010101010102], ["islands", 0.010101010101010102], ["bringing", 0.010101010101010102], ["eat", 0.010101010101010102], ["apart", 0.010101010101010102], ["school", 0.010101010101010102], ["gaze", 0.010101010101010102], ["straight", 0.010101010101010102], ["bugs", 0.010101010101010102], ["strange", 0.010101010101010102], ["weren", 0.010101010101010102], ["seeds", 0.010101010101010102], ["stopped", 0.010101010101010102], ["supposed", 0.010101010101010102], ["time", 0.010101010101010102], ["making", 0.010101010101010102], ["glued", 0.010101010101010102], ["accidentally", 0.010101010101010102]], "sentiment": ["Fish!

They weren\u2019t looking for nesting materials, since it was much too early in the game for that.\nThe male stopped doing what he was so busy doing, which was nothing. He caught sight of the female. He looked away from her, and then back again, standing still and making no sound. They both had voices, but at no point in the dance would either make a sound.\nShe looked this way and that, and then her gaze met his accidentally. They were then five meters apart or more.\nWhen Mary showed the film of the dance at the high school, she used to say at this point, as though she were speaking for the female: \u201cWhat on Earth could this strange person want with me? Really! How bizarre!\u201d\nThe male raised one bright blue foot. He spread it in air like a paper fan.\nMary Hepburn, again in the persona of the female, used to say, \u201cWhat is that supposed to be? A Wonder of the World?

["typical", 0.002680965147453083]], "sentiment": ["VONNEGUT: No. It was quite large, and there weren\u2019t very many of us. The attack didn\u2019t sound like a hell of a lot either. Whump. They went over with high explosives first to loosen things up, and then scattered incendiaries. When the war started, incendiaries were fairly sizeable, about as long as a shoebox. By the time Dresden got it, they were tiny little things. They burnt the whole damn town down.\nINTERVIEWER: What happened when you came up?\nVONNEGUT: Our guards were noncoms\u2014a sergeant, a corporal, and four privates\u2014and leaderless. Cityless, too, because they were Dresdeners who\u2019d been shot up on the front and sent home for easy duty. They kept us at attention for a couple of hours. They didn\u2019t know what else to do. They\u2019d go over and talk to each other. Finally we trekked across the rubble and they quartered us with some South Africans in a suburb. Every day we walked into the city and dug into basements and shelters to get the corpses out, as a sanitary measure. When we went into them, a typical shelter, an ordinary basement usually, looked like a streetcar full of people who\u2019d simultaneously had heart failure. Just people sitting there in their chairs, all dead. A fire storm is an amazing thing. It doesn\u2019t occur in nature. It\u2019s fed by the tornadoes that occur in the midst of it and there isn\u2019t a damned thing to breathe. We brought the dead out. They were loaded on wagons and taken to parks, large open areas in the city which weren\u2019t filled with rubble. The Germans got funeral pyres going, burning the bodies to keep them from stinking and from spreading disease. 130,000 corpses were hidden underground. It was a terribly elaborate Easter egg hunt. We went to work through cordons of German soldiers. Civilians didn\u2019t get to see what we were up to. After a few days the city began to smell, and a new technique was invented. Necessity is the mother of invention. We would bust into the shelter, gather up valuables from people\u2019s laps without attempting identification, and turn the valuables over to guards. Then soldiers would come with a flame thrower and stand in the door and cremate the people inside. Get the gold and jewelry out and then burn everybody inside.\nINTERVIEWER: What an impression on someone thinking of becoming a writer!\nVONNEGUT: It was a fancy thing to see, a startling thing. It was a moment of truth, too, because American civilians and ground troops didn\u2019t know American bombers were engaged in saturation bombing. It was kept a secret until very close to the end of the war. One reason they burned down Dresden is that they\u2019d already burned down everything else. You know: \u201cWhat\u2019re we going to do tonight?\u201d Here was everybody all set to go, and Germany still fighting, and this machinery for burning down cities was being used. It was a secret, burning down cities\u2014boiling pisspots and flaming prams. There was all this hokum about the Norden bombsight. You\u2019d see a newsreel showing a bombardier with an MP on either side of him holding a drawn .45. That sort of nonsense, and hell, all they were doing was just flying over cities, hundreds of airplanes, and dropping everything. When I went to the University of Chicago after the war the guy who interviewed me for admission had bombed Dresden. He got to that part of my life story and he said, \u201cWell, we hated to do it.\u201d The comment sticks in my mind.\nINTERVIEWER: Another reaction would be, \u201cWe were ordered to do it.\u201d\nVONNEGUT: His was more humane. I think he felt the bombing was necessary, and it may have been. One thing everybody learned is how fast you can rebuild a city. The engineers said it would take 500 years to rebuild Germany. Actually it took about 18 weeks.\nINTERVIEWER: Did you intend to write about it as soon as you went through the experience?\nVONNEGUT: When the city was demolished I had no idea of the scale of the thing\u2026. Whether this was what Bremen looked like or Hamburg, Coventry \u2026 I\u2019d never seen Coventry, so I had no scale except for what I\u2019d seen in movies. When I got home (I was a writer since I had been on the Cornell Sun except that was the extent of my writing) I thought of writing my war story, too. All my friends were home; they\u2019d had wonderful adventures, too. I went down to the newspaper office, The Indianapolis News, and looked to find out what they had about Dresden. There was an item about half an inch long, which said our planes had been over Dresden and two had been lost. And so I figured, well, this really was the most minor sort of detail in World War II. Others had so much more to write about. I remember envying Andy Rooney who jumped into print at that time; I didn\u2019t know him, but I think he was the first guy to publish his war story after the war; it was called Tail Gunner. Hell, I never had any classy adventure like that. But every so often I would meet a European and we would be talking about the war and I would say I was in Dresden; he\u2019d be astonished that I\u2019d been there, and he\u2019d always want to know more. Then a book by David Irving was published about Dresden, saying it was the largest massacre in European history. I said, By God, I saw something after all! I would try to write my war story, whether it was interesting or not, and try to make something out of it. I describe that process a little in the beginning of Slaughterhouse-Five; I saw it as starring John Wayne and Frank Sinatra.

She sat down at his table without being asked. She reached inside his shirt and tickled his nipples and all that. She told him that she liked big, silent men, and that all other Americans talked too much. She begged him to take her home with him after the club closed at two o\u2019clock that morning. She wanted to find out where the atomic bombs were, of course. Actually, there weren\u2019t any atomic bombs in Japan. They were on aircraft carriers and on Okinawa, and so on. For the rest of the evening she sang all her songs directly to him and to nobody else. He nearly fainted from joy and embarrassment. He had a Jeep outside.\nWhen she got into his Jeep at two o\u2019clock in the morning, she said she not only wanted to see where her big American lived, but where he worked. He told her that would be easy, since he lived and worked at the same place. He took her down to a new United States Army Quartermaster Corps dock in Osaka, which had a big shed running down the middle of it. At one end were some offices. At the other end was a two-room apartment for whoever the resident veterinarian happened to be. In between were great, refrigerated meat lockers, filled with carcasses Fender had inspected or would inspect. There was a fence on the land side and a guard at the gate; but as came out at the court-martial, discipline was lax. All the guard thought he had to watch out for was people trying to sneak out with sides of beef.\nSo the guard, who would later be acquitted by a court-martial, simply waved Dr. Fender\u2019s Jeep inside. He did not notice that there was an unauthorized woman lying on the floor.\nIzumi asked to look inside some of the meat lockers, which Bob was more than glad to show her. By the time they reached his apartment, which was at the outer end of the dock, she realized that he really was nothing but a meat inspector.\n\u201cBut she was so nice,\u201d Fender told me one time, \u201cand I was so nice, if I may say so, that she stayed for the night, anyway. I was scared to death, naturally, since I had never made love before. But then I said to myself, Just wait a minute. Just calm down. You have always been good with every kind of animal, practically from the minute you were born. Just keep one thing in mind: You\u2019ve got another nice little animal here.\u2019\u201d\nAs came out at Fender\u2019s court-martial: He and other members of the Army Veterinary Corps looked like soldiers, but they had not been trained to think like soldiers. It seemed unnecessary, since all they did anymore was inspect meat. The last veterinarian to be involved in any sort of fighting, it turned out, died at the Little Bighorn, at Custer\u2019s Last Stand. Also: There was a tendency on the part of the Army to coddle veterinarians, since they were so hard to recruit. They could make fortunes on the outside\u2014especially in cities, looking after peoples\u2019 pets. This was why they gave Fender such a pleasant, private apartment on the end of a dock. He inspected meat. As long as he did that, nobody was going to think of inspecting him.\n\u201cIf they had inspected my apartment,\u201d he told me, \u201cthey would not have found a speck of dust anywhere.\u201d They would also have found, according to him, \u201cone of the best private collections of Japanese pottery and fabrics in Osaka.\u201d He had gone berserk for the subtlety and delicacy of all things Japanese. This art mania was surely an apology, among other things, for his own huge and\u2014to him\u2014ugly useless hands and feet and all.\n\u201cIzumi kept looking back and forth between me and the beautiful things on my shelves and walls\u2014in my cupboards, in my drawers,\u201d he told me one time. \u201cIf you could have seen her expressions change when she did that,\u201d he said, \u201cyou would have to agree with me when I say, even though it\u2019s a very conceited thing for me to say: She fell in love with me.\u201d\nHe made breakfast the next morning, all with Japanese utensils, although it was an American breakfast\u2014bacon and eggs. She stayed curled up in bed while he cooked. She reminded him of the young deer, a doe he had raised when a boy. It was not a new thought. He had been taking care of that doe all night. He turned on his radio, which was tuned to the Armed Forces Network. He hoped for music. He got news instead. The biggest news was that a North Korean spy ring had been rounded up in Osaka in the wee hours of the morning. Their radio transmitter had been found. Only one member of the ring was still being hunted, and that was the woman who called herself \u201cIzumi.\u201d\nFender, by his own account, had \u201c\u2026 entered an alternate universe by then.\u201d He felt so much more at home in the new one than in the old one, simply because he was paired now with a woman, that he wasn\u2019t going to return to the old one ever again. What Izumi told him about her loyalty to the communist cause did not sound like enemy talk to him. \u201cIt was just common sense on the part of a good person from an alternate universe,\u201d he said.", 0.14914333205472438], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["hoenikker", 0.075], ["dr", 0.075], ["room", 0.075], ["love", 0.05], ["felix", 0.05], ["floor", 0.05], ["god", 0.05], ["wall", 0.025], ["stretched", 0.025], ["laboratory", 0.025], ["27", 0.025], ["purple", 0.025], ["top", 0.025], ["laureate", 0.025], ["nobel", 0.025], ["sacred", 0.025], ["mars", 0.025], ["cord", 0.025], ["plate", 0.025], ["explained", 0.025], ["sixth", 0.025], ["men", 0.025], ["brass", 0.025], ["building", 0.025], ["spent", 0.025], ["um", 0.025], ["matter", 0.025], ["doorway", 0.025], ["faust", 0.025], ["physics", 0.025]], "sentiment": ["\u201cAnd what did he say?\u201d\n\u201cHe said, \u2018What is God?

telephone and power lines were cut, so they couldn\u2019t even call for help or blow the siren.\nThe assault lasted half an hour. When it was over, Jeffrey Turner was gone, and he hasn\u2019t been seen since. The attackers also disappeared. Their uniforms and military vehicles were subsequently found at an abandoned dairy farm owned by German land speculators a kilometer north of the end of the lake. There were tire tracks of many automobiles, which led police to conclude that it was by means of unremarkable civilian vehicles, seemingly unrelated, and no doubt leaving the farm at timed intervals, that the lawless force had made its 100-percent-successful getaway.\nMeanwhile, back at the prison, anyone who didn\u2019t want to stay inside the walls anymore was free to walk out of there, first taking, if he was so inclined and got there early, a rifle or a shotgun or a pistol or a tear-gas grenade from the wide-open prison armory.\nTHE POLICE SAID, too, that the attackers of the prison obviously had had first-class military training somewhere, possibly at a private survival school somewhere in this country, or maybe in Bolivia or Colombia or Peru.\nANYWAY: MARGARET AND Mildred and I were awakened by the explosion, which demolished the main gate of the prison. There was no way we could have imagined what was really going on.\nThe 3 of us were sleeping in separate bedrooms. Margaret was on the first floor, Mildred and I were on the second floor. No sooner had I sat up, my ears ringing, than Mildred came into my room stark naked, her eyes open wide.\nShe spoke first. She used a slang word for hugeness I had never heard her speak before. It wasn\u2019t slang of her generation or even mine. It was slang of my children\u2019s generation. I guess she had heard it and liked it, and then held it in reserve for some really important occasion.\nHere is what she said, as sporadic small-arms fire broke out at the prison: \u201cDo you remember that humongous fish I caught?\u201d\n11\nAT ONE TIME I fully expected to spend the rest of my life in this valley, but not in jail. I envisioned my mandatory retirement from Tarkington College in 2010. I would be modestly well-off with Social Security and a pension from the College. My mother-in-law would surely be dead by then, I thought, so I would have only Margaret to care for. I would rent a little house in the town below.

He had devoted his life to this. Special plates were made for the party, and the guests got to take them home as souvenirs. There was a picture of a little bear on each one, and the date of the party.

There was no way anybody could prepare for the bewildering diversity of creatures and plants he was likely to encounter.\nThe people were doing their best to cut down on the number of species, so that life could be more predictable. But Nature was too creative for them. All life on the planet was suffocated at last by a living blanket one hundred feet thick.
