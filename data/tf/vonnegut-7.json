book review or used the word \u201cputrid.\u201d He was always coming out with words that surprised you, words like \u201cputrid,\u201d which you hadn\u2019t heard for a long time\u2014maybe since childhood\u2014but seemed to perfectly suit the situation.\nDuring the hippie days, Kurt and I were once invited to visit a Vermont commune (made famous in the era by its founder, Ray Mungo, in his book Total Loss Farm). Ray told us that he and his friends wanted to learn how to survive in primitive conditions because \u201cWe would like to be the last people on earth.\u201d Kurt said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of a stuck-up thing to want to be?\u201d I hadn\u2019t heard anyone bold and honest enough to use the term \u201cstuck-up\u201d since high school, but it fit the occasion perfectly.\nIn his conversation as well as his books and stories, Kurt was always speaking the unspeakable\u2014articulating what other people thought but were too politically or socially correct to say. It was in his DNA to point out that the emperor had no clothes, that there was an elephant in the room that everyone else was pretending not to notice. \u201cYou know, the truth can be really powerful stuff,\u201d Kurt observed in A Man Without a Country. \u201cYou\u2019re not expecting it.\u201d\nVonnegut spoke at a memorial service for his old friend Richard Yates; he not only championed Yates\u2019s work, he also loaned money without question to this masterful but often struggling writer, who was never fully appreciated until after his death. In a spontaneous remark at the memorial service, Kurt said Yates was just as good a writer as another friend, Nelson Algren, but had never received the same literary acclaim. As if thinking aloud, Kurt noted that Yates, unlike Algren, had never had an affair with Simone de Beauvoir; then he paused for a moment, and added, \u201cThese things count.\u201d There was spontaneous laughter, the kind that comes when someone says something others recognize as true but none have the wit or courage to say.\nVonnegut wrote in that same spirit of naked honesty, which explains why many people (including some of those Indiana relatives) were offended by his books. He wrote the way people spoke and used the words that are used in everyday speech, which often led to his work being banned by public-school boards and attempts being made to remove them from public libraries across the country. Vonnegut\u2019s worldwide bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five, was actually burned in a furnace in Drake, North Dakota, on orders from the local school committee. His searing letter to the chairman of the Drake school board, like a number of his letters protesting such attempts, supporting teachers and librarians, and defending the First Amendment, will be found in this book.\nVonnegut\u2019s writing, like his conversation, is often surprising, because it makes you laugh and makes you think by saying what was on your mind\u2014or in your mind\u2014that you hadn\u2019t dared say or think. It is disarming because it is done with such seemingly simple language and style that it sometimes seems shocking, and it is the shock of self-recognition. Robert Scholes, the first academic critic to recognize Vonnegut\u2019s work (and one of the most perceptive), explained in his book The Fabulators in 1967 that Vonnegut \u201c\u2026 uses the rhetorical potential of the short sentence and the short paragraph better than anyone now writing, often getting a rich comic or dramatic effect by isolating a single sentence in a separate paragraph or excerpting a phrase from context for a bizarre chapter-heading. The apparent simplicity and ordinariness of his writing masks its efficient power \u2026\u201d\nThis very \u201csimplicity and ordinariness\u201d made things difficult for most reviewers and critics, who resorted to pigeonholing him in ways that misconstrued and maligned his work. When Vonnegut worked in public relations for General Electric, he was \u201ccompletely surrounded by machines and ideas for machines, so I wrote a novel [Player Piano] about people and machines \u2026 And I learned from the reviewers that I was a science-fiction writer. I didn\u2019t know that. I supposed that I was writing a novel about life,\u201d he explained in the essay \u201cScience Fiction\u201d in The New York Times Book Review (later collected in Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons). \u201cI have been a sore-headed occupant of a file-drawer labeled \u2018science fiction\u2019 ever since, and I would like out, particularly since so many serious critics regularly mistake the drawer for a urinal.\u201d\nThe categorization did not prevent Vonnegut from using elements of classic science-fiction writing\u2014imaginary planets and life-forms, space travel to other worlds\u2014to illuminate human dilemmas as down-to-earth as love and hate, fear and folly, in places as \u201creal\u201d as Schenectady and Indianapolis, Dresden and Cape Cod, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and West Virginia. By 1967, even before the breakthrough bestseller Slaughterhouse-Five blew apart the conventional lines between science fiction and literature (with its hero, Billy Pilgrim, coming \u201cunstuck in time\u201d and moving between decades and places as distant as Toledo, Ohio, and the planet Tralfamadore), Robert Scholes could see that \u201cJust as pure romance provides us with necessary psychic exercise, intellectual comedy like Vonnegut\u2019s offers us moral stimulation\u2014not fixed ethical positions which we can complacently assume, but such thoughts as exercise our consciences and help us keep our humanity in shape, ready to respond to the humanity of others.\u201d\nYoung university teachers and critics like Jerome Klinkowitz and John Somer began to teach Vonnegut\u2019s work and write about it, first in a collection of essays called The Vonnegut Statement, in 1973. They dug out of libraries and old magazines previously uncollected articles and essays and convinced him to publish them in book form, as Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons, in 1974. They were joined by other young academics like Peter Reed, Marc Leeds, and Asa Pieratt, who appreciated, taught, compiled, and interpreted his work to new generations.\nNone of this attention, or the success that followed Slaughterhouse-Five, made Vonnegut immune to the outburst of rancor that came in the negative response to his 1976 novel Slapstick.", 0.14627014829142485], "title": "Letters"},

a relative who is secretly writing a history of parts of my family.

I have six children, three of my own and three of my sister\u2019s. They\u2019ve turned out gloriously. My first marriage worked, and continues to work.

And he pointed out to the easily alarmed librarian that the library\u2019s most recent general reference work was a 1938 Britannica, back-stopped by a 1910 Americana. He said many important things had happened since 1938, naming, among others, penicillin and Hitler\u2019s invasion of Poland.\nHe was advised to take his astonishment to some of the library\u2019s directors. He was given their names and addresses. There was a Cabot on the list\u2014and a Lowell and a Kittredge, and some others. The librarian told him that he had a chance of catching several directors all at once, if he would go to the Barnstable Yacht Club.

Freud said he didn\u2019t know what women wanted. I know what women want. They want a whole lot of people to talk to. What do they want to talk about? They want to talk about everything.\nWhat do men want? They want a lot of pals, and they wish people wouldn\u2019t get so mad at them.\nWhy are so many people getting divorced today? It\u2019s because most of us don\u2019t have extended families anymore. It used to be that when a man and a woman got married, the bride got a lot more people to talk to about everything. The groom got a lot more pals to tell dumb jokes to.\nA few Americans, but very few, still have extended families. The Navahos. The Kennedys.\nBut most of us, if we get married nowadays, are just one more person for the other person. The groom gets one more pal, but it\u2019s a woman. The woman gets one more person to talk to about everything, but it\u2019s a man.\nWhen a couple has an argument, they may think it\u2019s about money or power or sex, or how to raise the kids, or whatever.

glass case by the iron door were uniformly bleak and peevish. They contained information that only served to sadden anyone with a shred of curiosity. They told the exact time at which Mrs. Rumfoord\u2019s husband Winston and his dog Kazak materialized, and the exact time at which they dematerialized. The states of health of the man and his dog were invariably appraised as good. The reports implied that Mrs. Rumfoord\u2019s husband could see the past and the future clearly, but they neglected to give examples of sights in either direction.\nNow the crowd had been decoyed away from the estate to permit the untroubled arrival of a rented limousine at the small iron door in the west wall. A slender man in the clothes of an Edwardian dandy got out of the limousine and showed a paper to the policeman guarding the door. He was disguised by dark glasses and a false beard.\nThe policeman nodded, and the man unlocked the door himself with a key from his pocket. He ducked inside, and slammed the door behind himself with a clang.\nThe limousine drew away.\nBeware of the dog! said a sign over the small iron door. The fires of the summer sunset flickered among the razors and needles of broken glass set in concrete on the top of the wall.\nThe man who had let himself in was the first person ever invited by Mrs. Rumfoord to a materialization. He was not a great scientist. He was not even well-educated. He had been thrown out of the University of Virginia in the middle of his freshman year. He was Malachi Constant of Hollywood, California, the richest American-and a notorious rakehell.\nBeware of the dog! the sign outside the small iron door had said. But inside the wall there was only a dog\u2019s skeleton. It wore a cruelly spiked collar that was chained to the wall. It was the skeleton of a very large dog\u2014a mastiff. Its long teeth meshed. Its skull and jaws formed a cunningly articulated, harmless working model of a flesh-ripping machine. The jaws closed so\u2014clack. Here had been the bright eyes, there the keen ears, there the suspicious nostrils, there the carnivore\u2019s brain. Ropes of muscle had hooked here and here, had brought the teeth together in flesh so\u2014clack.\nThe skeleton was symbolic\u2014a prop, a conversation piece installed by a woman who spoke to almost no one. No dog had died at its post there by the wall. Mrs. Rumfoord had bought the bones from a veterinarian, had had them bleached and varnished and wired together. The skeleton was one of Mrs. Rumfoord\u2019 many bitter and obscure comments on the nasty tricks time and her husband had played on her.\nMrs. Winston Niles Rumfoord had seventeen million dollars. Mrs. Winston Niles Rumfoord had the highest social position attainable in the United States of America.

days.\u201d All I can say is, \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not a young person these days.\u201d\nYour college\u2019s president wished to exclude all negative thinking from his farewell to you, and so has asked me to make this announcement: \u201cAll persons who still owe parking fees are to pay up before leaving the property, or there will be monkey business with their transcripts.\u201d\nWhen I was a boy in Indianapolis, there was a humorist there named Kin Hubbard. He wrote a few lines for The Indianapolis News every day. Indianapolis needs all the humorists it can get. He was often as witty as Oscar Wilde. He said, for instance, that prohibition was better than no liquor at all. He said that whoever named near-beer was a poor judge of distance.\nI assume that the really important stuff has been spread out over your four years here and that you have no need of anything much from me. This is lucky for me. I have only this to say, basically: This is the end\u2014this is childhood\u2019s end for certain. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d as they used to say in the Vietnam War.\nPerhaps you have read the novel Childhood\u2019s End by Arthur C. Clarke, one of the few masterpieces in the field of science fiction. All of the others were written by me. In Clarke\u2019s novel, one of the characters undergoes a spectacular evolutionary change. The children become very different from the parents, less physical, more spiritual\u2014and one day they form up into a sort of column of light which spirals out into the universe, its mission unknown. The book ends there. You seniors, however, look a great deal like your parents, and I doubt that you will go radiantly into space as soon as you have your diplomas in hand. It is far more likely that you will go to Buffalo or Rochester or East Quogue\u2014or Cohoes.\nAnd I suppose you will all want money and true love, among other things. I will tell you how to make money: Work very hard. I will tell you how to win love: Wear nice clothing and smile all the time. Learn the words to all the latest songs.\nWhat other advice can I give you? Eat lots of bran to provide necessary bulk in your diet. The only advice my father ever gave me was this: \u201cNever stick anything in your ear.\u201d The tiniest bones in your body are inside your ears, you know\u2014and your sense of balance, too. If you mess around with your ears, you could not only become deaf, but you could also start falling down all the time. So just leave your ears completely alone. They\u2019re fine, just the way they are.\nDon\u2019t murder anybody\u2014even though New York State does not use the death penalty.\nThat\u2019s about it.\nOne sort of optional thing you might do is to realize there are six seasons instead of four. The poetry of four seasons is all wrong for this part of the planet, and this may explain why we are so depressed so much of the time. I mean, Spring doesn\u2019t feel like Spring a lot of the time, and November is all wrong for Fall and so on. Here is the truth about the seasons: Spring is May and June! What could be springier than May and June? Summer is July and August. Really hot, right? Autumn is September and October. See the pumpkins? Smell those burning leaves.

say?\nR.K.\n1\nHAVING WRITTEN \u201cThe End\u201d to this story of my life, I find it prudent to scamper back here to before the beginning, to my front door, so to speak, and to make this apology to arriving guests: \u201cI promised you an autobiography, but something went wrong in the kitchen. It turns out to be a diary of this past troubled summer, too! We can always send out for pizzas if necessary. Come in, come in.\u201d\nI am the erstwhile American painter Rabo Karabekian, a one-eyed man. I was born of immigrant parents in San Ignacio, California, in 1916. I begin this autobiography seventy-one years later. To those unfamiliar with the ancient mysteries of arithmetic, that makes this year 1987.\nI was not born a cyclops. I was deprived of my left eye while commanding a platoon of Army Engineers, curiously enough artists of one sort or another in civilian life, in Luxembourg near the end of World War Two. We were specialists in camouflage, but at that time were fighting for our lives as ordinary infantry. The unit was composed of artists, since it was the theory of someone in the Army that we would be especially good at camouflage.\nAnd so we were! And we were! What hallucinations we gave the Germans as to what was dangerous to them behind our lines, and what was not. Yes, and we were allowed to live like artists, too, hilariously careless in matters of dress and military courtesy. We were never attached to a unit as quotidian as a division or even a corps. We were under orders which came directly from the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force, which assigned us temporarily to this or that general, who had heard of our astonishing illusions. He was our patron for just a little while, permissive and fascinated and finally grateful.\nThen off we went again.\nSince I had joined the regular Army and become a lieutenant two years before the United States backed into the war, I might have attained the rank of lieutenant colonel at least by the end of the war. But I refused all promotions beyond captain in order to remain with my happy family of thirty-six men. That was my first experience with a family that large. My second came after the war, when I found myself a friend and seeming peer of those American painters who have now entered art history as founders of the Abstract Expressionist school.\nMy mother and father had families bigger than those two of mine back in the Old World\u2014and of course their relatives back there were blood relatives. They lost their blood relatives to a massacre by the Turkish Empire of about one million of its Armenian citizens, who were thought to be treacherous for two reasons: first because they were clever and educated, and second because so many of them had relatives on the other side of Turkey\u2019s border with its enemy, the Russian Empire.", -0.011467902016682501], "title": "Bluebeard"},

American represents property, privileges, and pleasures that have been denied the many. An even more instructive motto, in the light of history made by the Noah Rosewaters, might be: Grab much too much, or you'll get nothing at all.\nAnd Noah begat Samuel, who married Geraldine Ames Rockefeller. Samuel became even more interested in politics than his father had been, served the Republican Party tirelessly as a king-maker, caused that party to nominate men who would whirl like dervishes, bawl fluent Babylonian, and order the militia to fire into crowds whenever a poor man seemed on the point of suggesting that he and a Rosewater were equal in the eyes of the law.\nAnd Samuel bought newspapers, and preachers, too. He gave them this simple lesson to teach, and they taught it well: Anybody who thought that the United States of America was supposed to be a Utopia was a piggy, lazy, God-damned fool. Samuel thundered that no American factory hand was worth more than eighty cents a day. And yet he could be thankful for the opportunity to pay a hundred thousand dollars or more for a painting by an Italian three centuries dead. And he capped this insult by giving paintings to museums for the spiritual elevation of the poor. The museums were closed on Sundays.\nAnd Samuel begat Lister Ames Rosewater, who married Eunice Eliot Morgan. There was something to be said for Lister and Eunice: unlike Noah and Cleota and Samuel and Geraldine, they could laugh as though they meant it. As a curious footnote to history, Eunice became Woman's Chess Champion of the United States in 1927, and again in 1933.\nEunice also wrote an historical novel about a female gladiator, Ramba of Macedon, which was a best-seller in 1936. Eunice died in 1937, in a sailing accident in Cotuit, Massachusetts. She was a wise and amusing person, with very sincere anxieties about the condition of the poor. She was my mother.\nHer husband, Lister, never was in business. From the moment of his birth to the time I am writing this, he has left the manipulation of his assets to lawyers and banks. He has spent nearly the whole of his adult life in the Congress of the United States, teaching morals, first as a Representative from the district whose heart is Rosewater County, and then as Senator from Indiana. That he is or ever was an Indiana person is a tenuous political fiction. And Lister begat Eliot.\nLister has thought about the effects and implications of his inherited wealth about as much as most men think about their left big toes. The fortune has never amused, worried, or tempted him.

But you don\u2019t have to tell the police you think so.\u201d He laid his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSince your reprimand, anything you say can get you into terrible trouble. It can get us both into terrible trouble.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cTerrible.\u201d\nLightning blazed across the countryside. In the dazzling instant, Peter saw that the slopes still seethed with the digging horde. \u201cPerhaps I should give up speaking altogether, Josef.\u201d\n\u201cI ask only that you think out what you say. For your own good, Peter. Please, just stop and think.\u201d\n\u201cEverything you\u2019ve called me down for saying has been the truth. The paper I had to apologize for was the truth.\u201d Peter waited for a rolling barrage of thunder to subside. \u201cI mustn\u2019t speak the truth?\u201d\nJosef peered apprehensively around the corner, squinted into the darkness beneath the eaves. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t speak certain kinds of truth,\u201d he whispered, \u201cnot if you want to go on living.\u201d He dug his hands deep in his pockets, hunched his shoulders. \u201cGive in a little, Peter. Learn to overlook certain things. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d\nTogether, without exchanging another word, the brothers returned to the glare and suffocation of the barracks, their feet making sucking noises in their drenched shoes and socks.\n\u201cToo bad all our things are locked up until morning, Peter,\u201d said Josef loudly.\nPeter hung his coat on a nail to dry, dropped heavily on his hard bunk, and pulled his shoes off. His movements were clumsy, his nerves dulled by a vast aching sensation of pity, of loss. Just as the lightning had revealed for a split second the gray men and gouged mountainsides\u2014so had this talk suddenly revealed in a merciless flash the naked, frightened soul of his brother. Now Peter saw Josef as a frail figure in a whirlpool, clinging desperately to a raft of compromises. Peter looked down at his unsteady hands. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way,\u201d Josef had said, and Josef was right.\nJosef pulled a thin blanket over his head to screen out the light. Peter tried to lose himself in contemplation of the fossil ant again. Involuntarily, his powerful fingers clamped down on the white chip. The chip and priceless ant snapped in two. Ruefully, Peter examined the faces of the break, hoping to glue them together again. On one of the faces he saw a tiny gray spot, possibly a mineral deposit. Idly, he focused his magnifying glass on it.\n\u201cJosef!\u201d", -0.04337406015037595], "title": "Petrified Ants"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["major", 0.03333333333333333], ["house", 0.03333333333333333], ["modern", 0.03333333333333333], ["general", 0.03333333333333333], ["americans", 0.03333333333333333], ["demonstrator", 0.03333333333333333], ["karass", 0.03333333333333333], ["sympathizers", 0.03333333333333333], ["afghanistan", 0.03333333333333333], ["built", 0.03333333333333333], ["hated", 0.03333333333333333], ["44", 0.03333333333333333], ["45", 0.03333333333333333], ["42", 0.03333333333333333], ["43", 0.03333333333333333], ["40", 0.03333333333333333], ["41", 0.03333333333333333], ["bicycles", 0.03333333333333333], ["morgana", 0.03333333333333333], ["capital", 0.03333333333333333], ["communist", 0.03333333333333333], ["hope", 0.03333333333333333], ["fata", 0.03333333333333333], ["barracuda", 0.03333333333333333], ["mercy", 0.03333333333333333], ["39", 0.03333333333333333], ["38", 0.03333333333333333], ["meow", 0.03333333333333333], ["37", 0.03333333333333333], ["36", 0.03333333333333333]], "sentiment": ["36 MEOW\n37 A MODERN MAJOR GENERAL\n38 BARRACUDA CAPITAL OF THE WORLD\n39 FATA MORGANA\n40 HOUSE OF HOPE AND MERCY\n41 A KARASS BUILT FOR TWO\n42 BICYCLES FOR AFGHANISTAN\n43 THE DEMONSTRATOR\n44 COMMUNIST SYMPATHIZERS\n45 WHY AMERICANS ARE HATED", -0.146875], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "twobrzerotwob": {"tfidf": [["body", 0.03409090909090909], ["admire", 0.03409090909090909], ["art", 0.022727272727272728], ["eh", 0.022727272727272728], ["people", 0.022727272727272728], ["portrait", 0.022727272727272728], ["figure", 0.022727272727272728], ["painter", 0.022727272727272728], ["hitz", 0.022727272727272728], ["sawing", 0.022727272727272728], ["humble", 0.011363636363636364], ["indicated", 0.011363636363636364], ["pointed", 0.011363636363636364], ["dead", 0.011363636363636364], ["years", 0.011363636363636364], ["course", 0.011363636363636364], ["appropriate", 0.011363636363636364], ["good", 0.011363636363636364], ["dried", 0.011363636363636364], ["limb", 0.011363636363636364], ["gosh", 0.011363636363636364], ["fine", 0.011363636363636364], ["clapped", 0.011363636363636364], ["apple", 0.011363636363636364], ["puts", 0.011363636363636364], ["service", 0.011363636363636364], ["duncan", 0.011363636363636364], ["purple", 0.011363636363636364], ["disposal", 0.011363636363636364], ["responsible", 0.011363636363636364], ["burner", 0.011363636363636364], ["forty", 0.011363636363636364], ["killed", 0.011363636363636364], ["breath", 0.011363636363636364], ["setting", 0.011363636363636364], ["master", 0.011363636363636364], ["sheave", 0.011363636363636364], ["snipper", 0.011363636363636364], ["recommend", 0.011363636363636364], ["white", 0.011363636363636364], ["trash", 0.011363636363636364], ["worshiping", 0.011363636363636364], ["mock", 0.011363636363636364], ["disposing", 0.011363636363636364], ["gravy", 0.011363636363636364], ["woman", 0.011363636363636364], ["faceless", 0.011363636363636364], ["branch", 0.011363636363636364], ["demure", 0.011363636363636364], ["zeus", 0.011363636363636364], ["gas", 0.011363636363636364], ["strikes", 0.011363636363636364], ["delight", 0.011363636363636364], ["wrong", 0.011363636363636364], ["carrying", 0.011363636363636364], ["pruner", 0.011363636363636364], ["upsets", 0.011363636363636364], ["hands", 0.011363636363636364], ["comfortable", 0.011363636363636364], ["dr", 0.011363636363636364], ["chicago", 0.011363636363636364], ["omnipotent", 0.011363636363636364], ["kind", 0.011363636363636364], ["leora", 0.011363636363636364], ["stalks", 0.011363636363636364], ["haired", 0.011363636363636364], ["prove", 0.011363636363636364], ["tree", 0.011363636363636364], ["righty", 0.011363636363636364], ["chamber", 0.011363636363636364], ["carrier", 0.011363636363636364], ["time", 0.011363636363636364], ["tanned", 0.011363636363636364], ["honor", 0.011363636363636364], ["blushed", 0.011363636363636364], ["hostess", 0.011363636363636364]], "sentiment": ["\"A body's a body, eh?\" he said, \"All righty.

The fourth wall, as in Paul\u2019s office, was a single pane of glass. The meters were identical, the size of cigarette packages, and stacked like masonry, each labeled with a bright brass plate. Each was connected to a group of machines somewhere in the Works. A glowing red jewel called attention to the seventh meter from the bottom, fifth row to the left, on the east wall.\nPaul tapped the meter with his finger. \u201cUh-huh\u2014here we go again: number three in 58 getting rejects, all right.\u201d He glanced over the rest of the instruments. \u201cGuess that\u2019s all, eh?\u201d\n\u201cJust that one.\u201d\n\u201cWhatch goin\u2019 do with thet cat?\u201d said Bud.\nPaul snapped his fingers. \u201cSay, I\u2019m glad you asked that.

Paul sometimes wondered if he wouldn\u2019t have been more content in another period of history, but the Tightness of Bud\u2019s being alive now was beyond question. Bud\u2019s mentality was one that had been remarked upon as being peculiarly American since the nation had been born\u2014the restless, erratic insight and imagination of a gadgeteer.

It\u2019s this business about the school: school of painting, school of poetry, school of music, school of writing. For a couple of years after the War I was a graduate student in the Anthropology Department at the University of Chicago. At the instigation of a bright and neurotic instructor named Slotkin, I got interested in the notion of the school (I\u2019m going to explain what I mean in a minute), and decided to do a thesis on the subject. I did about 40 pages of the thing, based on the Cubist School in Paris, and then got told by the faculty that I\u2019d better pick something more strictly anthropological. They suggested rather firmly (with Slotkin abstaining) that I interest myself in the Indian Ghost Dance of 1894. Shortly thereafter I ran out of money and signed on with G-E, and I never did get past the note-taking stage on the Ghost Dance business (albeit damn interesting).\nBut Slotkin\u2019s notion of the importance of the school stuck with me, and it now seems pertinent to you, me, Knox, McQuade, and anybody else whose literary fortunes we take a personal interest in. What Slotkin said was this: no man who achieved greatness in the arts operated by himself; he was top man in a group of like-minded individuals. This works out fine for the cubists, and Slotkin had plenty of good evidence for its applying to Goethe, Thoreau, Hemingway, and just about anybody you care to name.\nIf this isn\u2019t 100% true, it\u2019s true enough to be interesting\u2014and maybe helpful.\nThe school gives a man, Slotkin said, the fantastic amount of guts it takes to add to culture. It gives him morale, esprit de corps, the resources of many brains, and\u2014maybe most important\u2014one-sidedness with assurance. (My reporting what Slotkin said four years ago is pretty subjective\u2014so let\u2019s say Vonnegut, a Slotkin derivative, is saying this.) About this one-sidedness: I\u2019m convinced that no one can amount to a damn in the arts if he becomes sweetly reasonable, seeing all sides of a picture, forgiving all sins.", 0.2595], "title": "Look

I tell him I have read a story he might enjoy. I tell him to sit in the easy chair whose cushion is still dented and warmed by my teenage butt.\nDad sits. I pick up the magazine and open it to the story. Dad is tired and blue. Dad starts to read. His pulse and breathing slow down. His troubles drop away, and so on.\nYes! And our little domestic playlet, true to life in the 1930s, dear reader, proves exactly what? It proves that a short story, because of its physiological and psychological effects on a human being, is more closely related to Buddhist styles of meditation than it is to any other form of narrative entertainment.\nWhat you have in this volume, then, and in every other collection of short stories, is a bunch of Buddhist catnaps.\nReading a novel, War and Peace, for example, is no catnap. Because a novel is so long, reading one is like being married forever to somebody nobody else knows or cares about. Definitely not refreshing!\nOh sure, we had radios before we had TV. But radios can\u2019t hold our attention, can\u2019t take control of our emotions, except in times of war. Radios can\u2019t make us sit still. Unlike print and plays and movies and boob tubes, radios don\u2019t give us anything for our restless eyes to do.\nListen: After I came home from World War Two, a brevet corporal twenty-two years old, I didn\u2019t want to be a fiction writer. I married my childhood sweetheart Jane Marie Cox, also from Indianapolis, up in Heaven now, and enrolled as a graduate student in the Anthropology Department of the University of Chicago. But I didn\u2019t want to be an anthropologist, either. I only hoped to find out more about human beings. I was going to be a journalist!\nTo that end, I also took a job as a police reporter for the Chicago City News Bureau. The News Bureau was supported by all four Chicago dailies back then, as a sensor for breaking news, prowling the city night and day, and as a training ground. The only way to get a job on one of those papers, short of nepotism, was to go through the News Bureau\u2019s hazing first.\nBut it became obvious that no newspaper positions were going to open up in Chicago or anywhere else for several years. Reporters had come home from the war to reclaim their jobs, and the women who had replaced them would not quit. The women were terrific. They should not have quit.\nAnd then the Department of Anthropology rejected my M.A. thesis, which proved that similarities between the Cubist painters in Paris in 1907 and the leaders of Native American, or Injun, uprisings late in the nineteenth century could not be ignored.

I have talked to old men who were on battlefields during that minute. They have told me in one way or another that the sudden silence was the Voice of God.

If you ever think something he wrote was sloppy, you might be right, but just to be sure, read it again.\nA little kid coming of age in Indiana in the Depression decides he wants to be a writer, a famous writer, and that\u2019s what ends up happening. What are the odds? He threw a lot of spaghetti up against the wall and developed a keen sense of what was going to stick.\nWhen I was sixteen, he couldn\u2019t get a job teaching English at Cape Cod Community College. My mother claimed that she went into bookstores and ordered his books under a false name so the books would at least be in the stores and maybe someone would buy them. Five years later he published Slaughterhouse-Five and had a million-dollar multi-book contract. It took some getting used to. Now, for most people looking back, Kurt\u2019s being a successful, even famous, writer is an \u201cof course\u201d kind of thing. For me it looks like something that very easily might have not happened.\nHe often said he had to be a writer because he wasn\u2019t good at anything else. He was not good at being an employee. Back in the mid-1950s, he was employed by Sports Illustrated, briefly. He reported to work, was asked to write a short piece on a racehorse that had jumped over a fence and tried to run away. Kurt stared at the blank piece of paper all morning and then typed, \u201cThe horse jumped over the fucking fence,\u201d and walked out, self-employed again.\nI\u2019ve never known a person less interested in food. The chain-smoking had something to do with it. When he complained about living so long, I told him that God was curious about how many cigarettes a human could smoke and He couldn\u2019t help wondering what was going to come out of Kurt\u2019s mouth next. The thing that made it hard to take him seriously when he said he was all done and had nothing more to say was that he started saying he was done in his mid-forties and he was still surprising people and coming up with good stuff in his mid-eighties.\nThe most radical, audacious thing to think is that there might be some point to working hard and thinking hard and reading hard and writing hard and trying to be of service.\nHe was a writer who believed in the magic of the process\u2014both what it did for him and what it could do for readers. The reader\u2019s time and attention were sacred to him. He connected with people on a visceral level because he realized that content was not the whole story. Kurt was and is like a gateway drug or a shoehorn. Once the reader is over the threshold, other writers become accessible.\n\u201cDoes anyone out of high school still read me?\u201d\nHe taught how stories were told and taught readers how to read. His writings will continue to do that for a long time. He was and is subversive, but not the way people thought he was. He was the least wild-and-crazy guy I ever knew. No drugs. No fast cars.", 0.09131978653530379], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
