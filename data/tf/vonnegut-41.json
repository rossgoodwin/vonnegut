And the day was so nice and the Easter service had been so beautiful and pure that they decided to take a walk through the zoo, and they were just walking on clouds.\"\n\"Um.\" The scene described was lifted from a play that was performed on television every Easter.\nThe Foxy Grandpa shoehorned himself into the scene, had himself chat with the Nations just before they got to the monkey house. \" \u2019Good morning, Mr. Nation,\u2019 I said to him. \u2019It certainly is a nice morning.\u2019 \u2019And a good morning to you, Mr. Howard,\u2019 he said to me. \u2019There is nothing like an Easter morning to make a man feel clean and reborn and at one with God\u2019s intentions.\u2019 \"", 0.254183201058201], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["celia", 0.02830188679245283], ["things", 0.02830188679245283], ["face", 0.02830188679245283], ["dance", 0.018867924528301886], ["paris", 0.018867924528301886], ["night", 0.018867924528301886], ["side", 0.018867924528301886], ["legend", 0.018867924528301886], ["goddess", 0.018867924528301886], ["apple", 0.018867924528301886], ["helen", 0.018867924528301886], ["trojan", 0.018867924528301886], ["felix", 0.018867924528301886], ["high", 0.018867924528301886], ["shoes", 0.009433962264150943], ["discord", 0.009433962264150943], ["course", 0.009433962264150943], ["troy", 0.009433962264150943], ["earth", 0.009433962264150943], ["fear", 0.009433962264150943], ["hildreth", 0.009433962264150943], ["tore", 0.009433962264150943], ["sparta", 0.009433962264150943], ["hated", 0.009433962264150943], ["prom", 0.009433962264150943], ["better", 0.009433962264150943], ["going", 0.009433962264150943], ["woman", 0.009433962264150943], ["reconstruct", 0.009433962264150943], ["trouble", 0.009433962264150943], ["school", 0.009433962264150943], ["heaven", 0.009433962264150943], ["die", 0.009433962264150943], ["married", 0.009433962264150943], ["gun", 0.009433962264150943], ["claw", 0.009433962264150943], ["told", 0.009433962264150943], ["financial", 0.009433962264150943], ["people", 0.009433962264150943], ["magnificent", 0.009433962264150943], ["culture", 0.009433962264150943], ["kidnap", 0.009433962264150943], ["written", 0.009433962264150943], ["bought", 0.009433962264150943], ["kicked", 0.009433962264150943], ["approached", 0.009433962264150943], ["exchange", 0.009433962264150943], ["men", 0.009433962264150943], ["aphrodite", 0.009433962264150943], ["mortal", 0.009433962264150943], ["swimming", 0.009433962264150943], ["golden", 0.009433962264150943], ["heeled", 0.009433962264150943], ["bound", 0.009433962264150943], ["feet", 0.009433962264150943], ["donated", 0.009433962264150943], ["city", 0.009433962264150943], ["midland", 0.009433962264150943], ["anger", 0.009433962264150943], ["doubt", 0.009433962264150943], ["white", 0.009433962264150943], ["war", 0.009433962264150943], ["underwear", 0.009433962264150943], ["boys", 0.009433962264150943], ["ashamed", 0.009433962264150943], ["prodigious", 0.009433962264150943], ["stocking", 0.009433962264150943], ["king", 0.009433962264150943], ["room", 0.009433962264150943], ["car", 0.009433962264150943], ["inside", 0.009433962264150943], ["corsage", 0.009433962264150943], ["gagged", 0.009433962264150943], ["beautiful", 0.009433962264150943], ["encountered", 0.009433962264150943], ["heard", 0.009433962264150943], ["ready", 0.009433962264150943], ["dress", 0.009433962264150943], ["astonishing", 0.009433962264150943], ["dancing", 0.009433962264150943], ["began", 0.009433962264150943], ["haiti", 0.009433962264150943], ["sacrifice", 0.009433962264150943], ["pool", 0.009433962264150943], ["sit", 0.009433962264150943], ["thought", 0.009433962264150943], ["time", 0.009433962264150943], ["senior", 0.009433962264150943], ["fitted", 0.009433962264150943]], "sentiment": ["It would have been better still, of course, if he had had himself bound and gagged in the gun room on the night of the senior prom.\nAs for Helen of Troy, and how she fitted into the legend, not that Celia Hildreth had ever heard of her: She was the most beautiful mortal woman on earth, and Aphrodite donated her to Paris in exchange for the apple.\nThere was just one trouble with Helen.

For another, he was confident that the General would blow the poor devil to bits if he dared appear. But certainly most distracting was an exotic mixture of despondency and elation which simmered in his young soul. He was despondent over his smashed dreams of a musical career, but elation was born of Hope\u2019s subtle but unmistakably affectionate mien.

"sentiment": ["The photographer wanted something more lively, though, a picture of an actual capture. So the guards staged one for him. They threw Billy into shrubbery. When Billy came out of the shrubbery, his face wreathed in goofy good will, they menaced him with their machine pistols, as though they were capturing him then.\nBilly\u2019s smile as he came out of the shrubbery was at least as peculiar as Mona Lisa\u2019s, for he was simultaneously on foot in Germany in 1944 and riding his Cadillac in 1967. Germany dropped away, and 1967 became bright and clear, free of interference from any other time. Billy was on his way to a Lions Club luncheon meeting. It was a hot August, but Billy\u2019s car was air-conditioned. He was stopped by a signal in the middle of Ilium\u2019s black ghetto. The people who lived here hated it so much that they had burned down a lot of it a month before. It was all they had, and they\u2019d wrecked it. The neighborhood reminded Billy of some of the towns he had seen in the war. The curbs and sidewalks were crushed in many places, showing where the National Guard tanks and halftracks had been.\n\u201cBlood brother,\u201d said a message written in pink paint on the side of a shattered grocery store.\nThere was a tap on Billy\u2019s car window. A black man was out there. He wanted to talk about something. The light had changed. Billy did the simplest thing. He drove on.\nBilly drove through a scene of even greater desolation. It looked like Dresden after it was fire-bombed\u2014like the surface of the moon. The house where Billy had grown up used to be somewhere in what was so empty now. This was urban renewal. A new Ilium Government Center and a Pavilion of the Arts and a Peace Lagoon and high-rise apartment buildings were going up here soon.\nThat was all right with Billy Pilgrim.\nThe speaker at the Lions Club meeting was a major in the Marines. He said that Americans had no choice but to keep fighting in Vietnam until they achieved victory or until the Communists realized that they could not force their way of life on weak countries. The major had been there on two separate tours of duty. He told of many terrible and many wonderful things he had seen. He was in favor of increased bombings, of bombing North Vietnam back into the Stone Age, if it refused to see reason.\nBilly was not moved to protest the bombing of North Vietnam, did not shudder about the hideous things he himself had seen bombing do. He was simply having lunch with the Lions Club, of which he was past president now.\nBilly had a framed prayer on his office wall which expressed his method for keeping going, even though he was unenthusiastic about living. A lot of patients who saw the prayer on Billy\u2019s wall told him that it helped them to keep going, too.

How much more pitiful it is when the person who falls has had all the advantages!\nMalachi Constant lay in the wide gutter of his kidney-shaped swimming pool, sleeping the sleep of a drunkard. There was a quarter of an inch of warm water in the gutter. Constant was fully dressed in blue-green evening shorts and a dinner jacket of gold brocade. His clothes were soaked.\nHe was all alone.\nThe pool had once been covered uniformly by an undulating blanket of gardenias. But a persistent morning breeze had moved the blooms to one end of the pool, as though folding a blanket to the foot of a bed. In folding back the blanket, the breeze revealed a pool bottom paved with broken glass, cherries, twists of lemon peel, peyotl buttons, slices of orange, stuffed olives, sour onions, a television set, a hypodermic syringe, and the ruins of a white grand piano.

"sentiment": ["\u201cMandarax,\u201d she said, \u201cturns out to be a very good teacher of the art of flower arranging.\u201d That was what she had been so proud of being, of course. But her self-respect had been severely crippled by the discovery that a little black box could not only teach what she taught, but could do so in a thousand different tongues.\n\u201cI was going to tell you. I meant to tell you,\u201d he said. This was another lie, and her learning that Mandarax knew ikebana was as improbable as her guessing the combination to a bank vault. She had been very reluctant to learn how to work Mandarax, and would remain so until she died.\nBut, by golly if she hadn\u2019t fiddled with the buttons there on the Omoo until, suddenly, Mandarax was telling her that the most beautiful flower arrangements had one, two, or at the most three, elements. In arrangements of three elements, said Mandarax, all three might be the same, or two of the three might be the same, but all three should never be different. Mandarax told her the ideal ratios between the altitudes of the elements in arrangements of more than one element, and between the elements and the diameters and altitudes of their vases or bowls\u2014or sometimes baskets.\nIkebana turned out to be as easily codified as the practice of modern medicine.\n*Zenji Hiroguchi had not himself taught Mandarax ikebana or anything else it knew. He had left that to underlings. The underling who taught Mandarax ikebana had simply taken a tape recorder to Hisako\u2019s famous ikebana class, and then boiled things down.\n*Zenji said to Hisako that he had had Mandarax learn ikebana as a pleasant surprise for Mrs. Onassis, to whom he intended to present the instrument on the final night of \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d \u201cI did it for her,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause she is supposed to be such a lover of beauty.\u201d\nThis happened to be the truth, but Hisako did not believe him. That was how bad things had become back in 1986. Nobody believed anybody anymore, since there was so much lying going on.\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Hisako, \u201cI am sure you did it for Mrs. Onassis, and to honor your wife as well.

by Craig Unger, published in early 2004, that humiliating, shameful, blood-soaked year.\n10\nA sappy woman from Ypsilanti sent me a letter a few years back. She knew I was sappy, too, which is to say a lifelong northern Democrat in the Franklin Delano Roosevelt tradition, a friend of the working stiffs. She was about to have a baby\u2014not mine\u2014and she wanted to know if it was a bad thing to bring such a sweet and innocent creature into a world as bad as this one.\nShe wrote, \u201cI\u2019d love to know your thoughts for a woman of 43 who is finally going to have a child but is wary of bringing a new life into such a frightening world.\u201d\nDon\u2019t do it! I wanted to tell her. It could be another George W. Bush or Lucrezia Borgia. The kid would be lucky to be born into a society where even the poor people are overweight but unlucky to be in one without a national health plan or decent public education for most, where lethal injection and warfare are forms of entertainment, and where it costs an arm and a leg to go to college. This would not be the case if the kid were a Canuck or Swede or Limey or Frog or Kraut. So either go on practicing safe sex or emigrate.\nBut I replied that what made being alive almost worthwhile for me, besides music, was all the saints I met, who could be anywhere. By saints I meant people who behaved decently in a strikingly indecent society.\nJoe, a young man from Pittsburg, came up to me with one request: \u201cPlease tell me it will all be okay.\u201d\n\u201cWelcome to Earth, young man,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s hot in the summer and cold in the winter.

I have to take my shoes off and have them scanned by an X-ray machine because some guy tried to blow up an airliner with his sneakers. And I thought, I feel like I\u2019m in a world not even Kurt Vonnegut could have imagined. So now that I find I can ask you such questions, tell me, could you have imagined it?

did not like this place much, in case some alumni secretary or chaplain is about to burst into tears. It was my father\u2019s fault. He said I should become a chemist like my brother, and not waste my time and his money on subjects he considered so much junk jewelry\u2014literature, history, philosophy. I had no talent for science. What was infinitely worse: all my fraternity brothers were engineers.\n\u201cI probably would have adored this hellhole, if I had been allowed to study and discuss the finer things in Ufe. Also: I would not have become a writer.\n\u201cI eventually wound up on academic probation. I was accelerating my course at the time\u2014because of the war. My instructor in organic chemistry was my lab partner in biochemistry. He was fit to be tied.\n\u201cAnd one day I came down with pneumonia. It is such a dreamy disease. Pneumonia used to be called \u2019the old people\u2019s friend.\u2019 It can be a young person\u2019s friend, too. All that you feel is that you are sleepy and that it is time to go. I did not die, so far as I know\u2014but I left Cornell, and I\u2019ve never come back until now.\n\u201cGood evening, fellow Cornellians. I am here to congratulate The Cornell Daily Sun on its one-hundredth anniversary. To place this event in historical perspective: the Sun is now forty years younger than the saxophone, and sixty years older than the electric guitar.\n\u201cIt was a family to me\u2014one that included women. Once a week we allowed coeds to put together a woman\u2019s page, but I never got to know any of them. They always seemed so burned up about something. I never did find out what it was. It must have been something over at the sorority house.\n\u201cI pity you Sun people of today for not having truly great leaders to write about\u2014Roosevelt and Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek and Stalin on the side of virtue, and Hitler and Mussolini and Emperor Hirohito on the side of sin.\n\u201cOh, sure, we have another world war coming, and another great depression, but where are the leaders this time? All you have is a lot of ordinary people standing around with their thumbs up their ass.\n\u201cHere is what we must do, if glamour is to be restored to those who lead us into catastrophes, out of catastrophes, and then back into catastrophes again: We must oudaw television and set an example for our children by worshiping the silver screens in motion picture palaces every week.\n\u201cWe should see moving and talking images of leaders only once a week in newsreels.

This time Brother Starbuck is going to bend those proud Harvard knees, and he\u2019s going to pray with you.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d hate to disappoint Him,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHave you ever done anything else?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I used to do: disappoint Jesus every day.\u201d\nI do not mean to sketch this blubbering leviathan as a religious hypocrite, nor am I entitled to. He had so opened himself to the consolations of religion that he had become an imbecile. In my time at the White House I had feared him as much as my ancestors must have feared Ivan the Terrible, but now I could be as impudent as I liked with him. He was no more sensitive to slights and jokes at his expense than a village idiot.\nMay I say, further, that on this very day Emil Larkin puts his money where his mouth is. A wholly owned subsidiary of my division here at RAMJAC, Heartland House, a publisher of religious books in Cincinnati, Ohio, published Larkin\u2019s autobiography, Brother, Won\u2019t You Pray with Me?, six weeks ago. All of Larkin\u2019s royalties, which could well come to half a million dollars or more, excluding motion-picture and paperback rights, are to go to the Salvation Army.\n\u201cWho told you where I was?\u201d I asked him. I was sorry he had found me. I had hoped to get out of prison without his asking me to pray with him one last time.\n\u201cClyde Carter,\u201d he said.", -0.015589080459770113], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["dr", 0.0898876404494382], ["breed", 0.056179775280898875], ["pefko", 0.0449438202247191], ["explain", 0.033707865168539325], ["guards", 0.033707865168539325], ["guard", 0.02247191011235955], ["year", 0.02247191011235955], ["laboratory", 0.02247191011235955], ["badge", 0.02247191011235955], ["horvath", 0.02247191011235955], ["charlatan", 0.02247191011235955], ["left", 0.02247191011235955], ["control", 0.011235955056179775], ["thoughtfully", 0.011235955056179775], ["heavily", 0.011235955056179775], ["elevators", 0.011235955056179775], ["national", 0.011235955056179775], ["turned", 0.011235955056179775], ["clear", 0.011235955056179775], ["scientist", 0.011235955056179775], ["armed", 0.011235955056179775], ["arm", 0.011235955056179775], ["pink", 0.011235955056179775], ["funny", 0.011235955056179775], ["lapel", 0.011235955056179775], ["rose", 0.011235955056179775], ["kindergarten", 0.011235955056179775], ["secret", 0.011235955056179775], ["unadorned", 0.011235955056179775], ["black", 0.011235955056179775], ["passed", 0.011235955056179775], ["grand", 0.011235955056179775], ["answer", 0.011235955056179775], ["granite", 0.011235955056179775], ["brick", 0.011235955056179775], ["hoenikker", 0.011235955056179775], ["indicating", 0.011235955056179775], ["nice", 0.011235955056179775], ["explaining", 0.011235955056179775], ["entrance", 0.011235955056179775], ["good", 0.011235955056179775], ["august", 0.011235955056179775], ["confidential", 0.011235955056179775], ["moved", 0.011235955056179775], ["dumber", 0.011235955056179775], ["stories", 0.011235955056179775], ["touching", 0.011235955056179775], ["understand", 0.011235955056179775], ["breast", 0.011235955056179775], ["smiled", 0.011235955056179775], ["smile", 0.011235955056179775], ["foyer", 0.011235955056179775], ["building", 0.011235955056179775], ["mourned", 0.011235955056179775], ["couldn", 0.011235955056179775], ["16", 0.011235955056179775], ["climbed", 0.011235955056179775], ["urged", 0.011235955056179775], ["ceremoniously", 0.011235955056179775], ["protection", 0.011235955056179775], ["steps", 0.011235955056179775], ["security", 0.011235955056179775], ["soft", 0.011235955056179775], ["top", 0.011235955056179775]], "sentiment": ["\u201cIf there\u2019s something you don\u2019t understand,\u201d urged Dr. Breed, \u201cask Dr. Horvath to explain it.

was there with his booby-trapped sister and mother and his normal father, and I asked him, \u201cWhat do you think of us now, Lieutenant Patton?\u201d He was the goat of our class, meaning he had the lowest grade average. So had General George Patton been, again no relative of Jack\u2019s, who had been such a great leader in World War II.\nWhat Jack replied, of course, unsmilingly, was that he had to laugh like hell.\n7\nI HAVE BEEN reading issues of the Tarkington College alumni magazine, The Musketeer, going all the way back to its first issue, which came out in 1910. It was so named in honor of Musket Mountain, a high hill not a mountain, on the western edge of the campus, at whose foot, next to the stable, so many victims of the escaped convicts are buried now.\nEvery proposed physical improvement of the college plant triggered a storm of protest. When Tarkington graduates came back here, they wanted it to be exactly as they remembered it. And 1 thing at least never did change, which was the size of the student body, stabilized at 300 since 1925. Meanwhile, of course, the growth of the prison population on the other side of the lake, invisible behind walls, was as irresistible as Thunder Beaver, as Niagara Falls.\nJudging from letters to The Musketeer, I think the change that generated the most passionate resistance was the modernization of the Lutz Carillon soon after World War II, a memorial to Ernest Hubble Hiscock. He was a Tarkington graduate who at the age of 21 was a nose-gunner on a Navy bomber whose pilot crashed his plane with a full load of bombs onto the flight deck of a Japanese aircraft carrier in the Battle of Midway during World War II.\nI would have given anything to die in a war that meaningful.\nME? I WAS in show business, trying to get a big audience for the Government on TV by killing real people with live ammunition, something the other advertisers were not free to do.\nThe other advertisers had to fake everything.\nOddly enough, the actors always turned out to be a lot more believable on the little screen than we were.

It had been accepted years ago, apparently, for the date on the magazine was April, 1962. Trout found it by chance in a bin of tame old magazines near the front of the store. They were underpants magazines.\nWhen he bought the magazine, the cashier supposed Trout was drunk or feeble-minded. All he was getting, the cashier thought, was pictures of women in their underpants. Their legs were apart, all right, but they had on underpants, so they were certainly no competition for the wide-open beavers on sale in the back of the store.\n\u201cI hope you enjoy it,\u201d said the cashier to Trout. He meant that he hoped Trout would find some pictures he could masturbate to, since that was the only point of all the books and magazines.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for an arts festival,\u201d said Trout.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAs for the story itself, it was entitled \u201cThe Dancing Fool.\u201d Like so many Trout stories, it was about a tragic failure to communicate.\nHere was the plot: A flying saucer creature named Zog arrived on Earth to explain how wars could be prevented and how cancer could be cured. He brought the information from Margo, a planet where the natives conversed by means of farts and tap dancing.\nZog landed at night in Connecticut.
