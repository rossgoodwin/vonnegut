1992\nSagaponack, NY\nTO MARC LEEDS\nDear Marc\u2014\nRest assured that I think of you often, and that the bell you gave me is on my mantelpiece. I have been slow to answer your good letter of more than a month ago because my domestic life continues to be a shitstorm. My wife demanded a divorce, but then, as her love life failed to take the course she thought it would, she wants me back again. She thought she had another escort and meal ticket, but she was mistaken. Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, \u201cIt might have been.\u201d\n[\u2026] I should have warned you that Putnam is a bottom line operation, no more interested in art and learning than a department store. I suppose you know that soon after it published Hocus Pocus it became one more property of the Japanese.\nOn occasion, Nature can be surprisingly merciful. It has always been the case with me that when my life is a mess I can find some relief by writing. So I am, after a year of hacking out trash on my IBM Selectric, at last in control of material which can be another novel. I feel good about it. It is called Timequake. Like this country, it should be completely finished in another year.\nCheers,", 0.1720588235294118], "title": "Letters"}}
