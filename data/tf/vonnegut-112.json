The last time I saw you, you were certainly one of the nicest people I had ever seen. Now I hear that you are learning to dance. That makes you just about perfect.\nOctober 2, 1965\n[Iowa City]\nTO JANE VONNEGUT\nDearest Jane:\nThings are a lot better. I went riding at the Bourjailys\u2019 farm yesterday afternoon with Mrs. Bourjaily (Tina), found that I loved it, still rode damn well. I had forgotten that I ever did anything physical damn well, but, by God, even I must admit that I ride damn well. Vance doesn\u2019t care for the sport. He is a great hunter, a blood sport man. Max, of course, despises all blood sport men, and I kind of think he is right. Only Vance has turned out to be a most generous, wise, and friendly man. I stayed for supper, and the Algrens came. They\u2019re fine, too. Nelson gave me a big red sticker for my little automobile. It said, \u201cSTOP THE WAR IN VIET NAM!\u201d I stuck it on my car, but the car was wet, and the sticker blew off before I was half way home, and I\u2019m just as glad. My gladness doesn\u2019t have anything to do with how I feel about Viet Nam. It has to do with how I feel about stickers.\nI haven\u2019t moved into my new quarters yet, will probably do so in about five days. Two very clean Chinamen are living there now, for very temporary shelter. They\u2019ll be leaving soon. The apartment is the entire first floor of a Victorian mansion. It is on seven acres, has an orchard, a grape arbor, a barn. It\u2019s on a hill. This is a hilly place, which surprised me, and the river is lovely. You can just about imagine what the first floor of such a house is like: an entrance hall, a parlor to the right of it, a dining room back of that, and a kitchen as modern as ours back of that, and a porch back of that. And then, to one side of the dining room, and back of the entrance hall, a luxury bedroom and bath. The furnishings are gorgeous\u2014pieces belonging to the same astonishing period as the house. There is a washing machine in the basement. The Chinamen have been sleeping in separate areas, one (they all look alike to me) in the bedroom, and one on a bed set up in the entrance hall. It will be fun spotting two beds for Edith and Nanny. If Edith wanted to come out right away, she could have the bed in the front hall, which isn\u2019t nearly as exposed as it sounds. Everybody comes and goes by the back porch.\nPaul Engle, who is about to leave for a nine-month tour of Europe, has been conscience-stricken about my bad living quarters and the hugeness of my classes. I am carrying as heavy a load as anybody in the English Department, which isn\u2019t the way things are supposed to be at all with a Writer in Residence. Anyway, he has gotten me this great house, and has just begged the head of the English Department, Dr. Gerber, to give me a raise from $8,500 to $12,500\u2014a raise instead of the cash bonus he originally suggested to help me afford the better house. He thinks what will happen is that I will get maybe a $1,000 raise, at least. If I got only that much, it would mean that suddenly my rent was all taken care of. Not bad. And I might get more.\nYour adoring husband,\nK", 0.1988296227581942], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["trout", 0.03208556149732621], ["clara", 0.03208556149732621], ["zine", 0.0213903743315508], ["kilgore", 0.0213903743315508], ["monica", 0.0213903743315508], ["bums", 0.016042780748663103], ["american", 0.016042780748663103], ["cigar", 0.016042780748663103], ["staff", 0.0106951871657754], ["wouldn", 0.0106951871657754], ["coast", 0.0106951871657754], ["people", 0.0106951871657754], ["rivers", 0.0106951871657754], ["contests", 0.0106951871657754], ["won", 0.0106951871657754], ["unknown", 0.0106951871657754], ["nerve", 0.0106951871657754], ["attack", 0.0106951871657754], ["life", 0.0106951871657754], ["academy", 0.0106951871657754], ["gas", 0.0106951871657754], ["patriot", 0.0106951871657754], ["work", 0.0106951871657754], ["lie", 0.0106951871657754], ["sick", 0.0106951871657754], ["beauty", 0.0106951871657754], ["reach", 0.0106951871657754], ["persons", 0.0106951871657754], ["order", 0.0106951871657754], ["exclusive", 0.0053475935828877], ["departed", 0.0053475935828877], ["office", 0.0053475935828877], ["cheerful", 0.0053475935828877], ["radio", 0.0053475935828877], ["prince", 0.0053475935828877], ["strikingly", 0.0053475935828877], ["limbs", 0.0053475935828877], ["tv", 0.0053475935828877], ["hated", 0.0053475935828877], ["unhappy", 0.0053475935828877], ["indian", 0.0053475935828877], ["version", 0.0053475935828877], ["hope", 0.0053475935828877], ["woman", 0.0053475935828877], ["victims", 0.0053475935828877], ["cots", 0.0053475935828877], ["battlefields", 0.0053475935828877], ["safe", 0.0053475935828877], ["flew", 0.0053475935828877], ["hale", 0.0053475935828877], ["frankenstein", 0.0053475935828877], ["creed", 0.0053475935828877], ["large", 0.0053475935828877], ["lose", 0.0053475935828877], ["accompanied", 0.0053475935828877], ["studios", 0.0053475935828877], ["set", 0.0053475935828877], ["neighborhood", 0.0053475935828877], ["regret", 0.0053475935828877], ["dreamboat", 0.0053475935828877], ["idea", 0.0053475935828877], ["street", 0.0053475935828877], ["skulls", 0.0053475935828877], ["cigars", 0.0053475935828877], ["spirited", 0.0053475935828877], ["driving", 0.0053475935828877], ["greeks", 0.0053475935828877], ["wrecked", 0.0053475935828877], ["dudley", 0.0053475935828877], ["children", 0.0053475935828877], ["bazooka", 0.0053475935828877], ["public", 0.0053475935828877], ["pepper", 0.0053475935828877], ["monster", 0.0053475935828877], ["tending", 0.0053475935828877], ["free", 0.0053475935828877], ["disappeared", 0.0053475935828877], ["broken", 0.0053475935828877], ["triage", 0.0053475935828877], ["thrown", 0.0053475935828877], ["deserved", 0.0053475935828877], ["involved", 0.0053475935828877], ["citizens", 0.0053475935828877], ["thing", 0.0053475935828877], ["smoke", 0.0053475935828877], ["confronted", 0.0053475935828877], ["asked", 0.0053475935828877], ["point", 0.0053475935828877], ["billions", 0.0053475935828877], ["indoors", 0.0053475935828877], ["message", 0.0053475935828877], ["armed", 0.0053475935828877], ["millions", 0.0053475935828877], ["story", 0.0053475935828877], ["ancient", 0.0053475935828877], ["stretch", 0.0053475935828877], ["west", 0.0053475935828877], ["museum", 0.0053475935828877], ["system", 0.0053475935828877], ["needed", 0.0053475935828877], ["peppers", 0.0053475935828877], ["limousine", 0.0053475935828877], ["war", 0.0053475935828877], ["hospital", 0.0053475935828877], ["box", 0.0053475935828877], ["depressing", 0.0053475935828877], ["carrying", 0.0053475935828877], ["smoking", 0.0053475935828877], ["nathan", 0.0053475935828877], ["recovering", 0.0053475935828877], ["guards", 0.0053475935828877], ["country", 0.0053475935828877], ["awakened", 0.0053475935828877], ["beautiful", 0.0053475935828877], ["turned", 0.0053475935828877], ["fuck", 0.0053475935828877], ["cbs", 0.0053475935828877], ["nation", 0.0053475935828877], ["chauffeur", 0.0053475935828877], ["52nd", 0.0053475935828877], ["sidewalks", 0.0053475935828877], ["jerry", 0.0053475935828877], ["member", 0.0053475935828877], ["huffmobile", 0.0053475935828877], ["broadcasting", 0.0053475935828877], ["swore", 0.0053475935828877], ["steered", 0.0053475935828877], ["picture", 0.0053475935828877], ["columbia", 0.0053475935828877], ["shelter", 0.0053475935828877], ["destructive", 0.0053475935828877], ["gallery", 0.0053475935828877], ["energized", 0.0053475935828877], ["broadcast", 0.0053475935828877], ["practiced", 0.0053475935828877], ["alarm", 0.0053475935828877], ["vehicles", 0.0053475935828877], ["warm", 0.0053475935828877], ["wounded", 0.0053475935828877], ["senior", 0.0053475935828877], ["smoked", 0.0053475935828877]], "sentiment": ["The last thing to come out of the box was hope. It flew away.\nI didn\u2019t make that depressing story up. Neither did Kilgore Trout. Ancient Greeks did.\nThis is the point I want to make, though: Frankenstein\u2019s monster was unhappy and destructive, whereas the people Trout energized in the neighborhood of the Academy, although most of them wouldn\u2019t have won any beauty contests, were by and large cheerful and public-spirited.\nI have to say most of them wouldn\u2019t have won any beauty contests. There was at least one strikingly beautiful woman involved. That was a member of the Academy\u2019s office staff. That was Clara Zine. Monica Pepper is certain that Clara Zine was the one who was smoking the cigar that set off the smoke alarm in the picture gallery. When confronted by Monica, Clara Zine swore that in her whole life she had never smoked a cigar, that she hated cigars, and she disappeared.\nI have no idea what has become of her.\nClara Zine and Monica were tending the wounded in the former Museum of the American Indian, which Trout had turned into a hospital, when Monica asked Clara about the cigar, and then Clara departed in a huffmobile.\nTrout, carrying what had become his bazooka, and accompanied by Dudley Prince and the other two armed guards, had thrown out all the bums who were still in the shelter. They did that in order to free up the cots for people with broken limbs or skulls or whatever, who needed and deserved to lie down where it was warm even more than the bums did.\nIt was triage, such as Kilgore Trout had seen practiced on World War Two battlefields. \u201cI only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country,\u201d said the American patriot Nathan Hale. \u201cFuck the bums!\u201d said the American patriot Kilgore Trout.\nIt was Jerry Rivers, the chauffeur of the Peppers\u2019 stretch limousine, however, who steered his dreamboat around wrecked vehicles and their victims, often driving on sidewalks, to reach the studios of the Columbia Broadcasting System down on West 52nd Street. Rivers awakened the staff there with, \u201cYou were sick, but now you\u2019re well again, and there\u2019s work to do.\u201d And then he got them to broadcast that same message on both radio and TV from coast to coast.\nIn order to get them to do that, though, he had to tell them a lie. He said everybody was recovering from a nerve gas attack by persons unknown. So the first version of Kilgore\u2019s Creed to reach millions in the nation, and then billions in the world, was this: \u201cThis is a CBS exclusive! There has been a nerve gas attack by persons unknown. You were sick, but now you\u2019re well again, and there\u2019s work to do.

I was wearing the clothes\u2014fur-collared impresario\u2019s cloak and blue serge suit\u2014I had been captured in. I was also carrying, for whimsy, a cane.

took shelter in an echoing meat locker which was hollowed in living rock under the slaughterhouse. There was an iron staircase with iron doors at the top and bottom.\nDown in the locker were a few cattle and sheep and pigs and horses hanging from iron hooks. So it goes. The locker had empty hooks for thousands more. It was naturally cool. There was no refrigeration. There was candlelight. The locker was whitewashed and smelled of carbolic acid. There were benches along a wall. The Americans went to these, brushing away flakes of whitewash before they sat down.\nHoward W. Campbell, Jr., remained standing, like the guards. He talked to the guards in excellent German. He had written many popular German plays and poems in his time, and had married a famous German actress named Resi North. She was dead now, had been killed while entertaining troops in the Crimea. So it goes.\nNothing happened that night. It was the next night that about one hundred and thirty thousand people in Dresden would die. So it goes. Billy dozed in the meat locker. He found himself engaged again, word for word, gesture for gesture, in the argument with his daughter with which this tale began.\n\u201cFather,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are we going to do with you?\u201d And so on. \u201cYou know who I could just kill?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWho could you kill?\u201d said Billy.\n\u201cThat Kilgore Trout.\u201d\nKilgore Trout was and is a science-fiction writer, of course. Billy had not only read dozens of books by Trout\u2014he has also become Trout\u2019s friend, to the extent that anyone can become a friend of Trout, who is a bitter man.\nTrout lives in a rented basement in Ilium, about two miles from Billy\u2019s nice white home. He himself has no idea how many novels he has written\u2014possibly seventy-five of the things. Not one of them has made money. So Trout keeps body and soul together as a circulation man for the Ilium Gazette, manages newspaper delivery boys, bullies and flatters and cheats little kids.\nBilly met him for the first time in 1964. Billy drove his Cadillac down a back alley in Ilium, and he found his way blocked by dozens of boys and their bicycles. A meeting was in progress. The boys were harangued by a man in a full beard.

The child\u2019s hair was jet black, bristly\u2014and the\u2019 black bristles grew in a violently counter-clockwise swirl.\nThe child was left-handed. The ball rested on his right fist, and he prepared to hit it with his left.\nHis eyes were deep-set, like his father\u2019s eyes. And his eyes were luminous under their black-thatched eaves. They glowed with an unshared rage.\nThose rage-filled eyes flicked this way, then that. Their movements rattled the fielders, drawing them away from their positions, convincing them that the slow, stupid ball was going to come at them with terrible speed, was going to tear them to pieces if they dared to get in the way.\nThe alarm inspired by the boy at bat was felt by the teacher, too. She was in the traditional position for an umpire in German batball, between first and second base, and she was terrified. She was a frail old lady name Isabel Fenstermaker. She was seventy-three, and had been a Jehovah\u2019s Witness before having her memory cleaned out. She had been shanghaied while trying to sell a copy of The Watchtower to a Martian agent in Duluth.\n\"Now, Chrono\u2014\" she said simperingly, \"it\u2019s only a game, you know.\"\nThe sky was suddenly blackened by a formation of a hundred flying saucers, the blood-red ships of the Martian Parachute Ski Marines. The combined cooing of the ships was a melodious thunder that rattled the school-house windowpanes.\nBut, as a measure of the importance young Chrono gave to German batball when he came to bat, not a single child looked up at the sky.\nYoung Chrono, having brought the fielders and Miss Fenstermaker to the brink of nervous collapse, now put the ball down by his feet, took from his pocket a short strip of metal that was his good-luck piece.

telling teenage girls that they can get pregnant if they\u2019re not careful and so on, would surely consider Terry Kitchen\u2019s concept of non-epiphanies blasphemous. But I can\u2019t think of anybody who tried harder than he did to find worthwhile errands to run for God. He could have had brilliant careers in law or business or finance or politics. He was a magnificent pianist, and a great athlete, too. He might have stayed in the Army and soon become a general and maybe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nWhen I met him, though, he had given all that up in order to be a painter, even though he couldn\u2019t draw for sour apples, and had never had an art lesson in his life! \u201cSomething\u2019s just got to be worth doing!\u201d he said. \u201cAnd painting is one of the few things I haven\u2019t tried.\u201d\nA lot of people, I know, think that Terry could draw realistically, if he wanted to do so. But their only proof of that is a small patch in a painting that used to hang in my foyer here. He never gave the picture a title, but it is now generally known as Magic Window.\nExcept for one little patch, that picture is a typical Kitchen airbrush view of a brightly colored storm system as viewed from an orbiting satellite, or whatever you want to call it. But the little patch, if examined carefully, turns out to be an upside-down copy of John Singer Sargent\u2019s full-length \u201cPortrait of Madame X,\u201d with her famous milk-white shoulders and ski-jump nose and so on.\nI\u2019m sorry, folks: that whimsical insert, that magic window, wasn\u2019t Terry\u2019s work, and couldn\u2019t have been Terry\u2019s work. It was done at Terry\u2019s insistence by a hack illustrator with the unlikely name of Rabo Karabekian.\nTerry Kitchen said that the only moments he ever experienced as non-epiphanies, when God left him alone, were those following sex and the two times he took heroin.\n22\nBULLETIN FROM THE PRESENT: Paul Slazinger has gone to Poland, of all places. According to The New York Times this morning, he was sent there for a week by the international writers\u2019 organization called \u201cPEN\u201d\u2014as a part of a delegation to investigate the plight of his suffocated colleagues there.\nPerhaps the Poles will reciprocate, and investigate his plight in turn. Who is more to be pitied, a writer bound and gagged by policemen or one living in perfect freedom who has nothing more to say?\nBulletin from the present: the widow Berman has installed an old-fashioned pool table dead center in my living room, having sent the furniture it displaced to Home Sweet Home Moving and Storage.

He connects his hand and paintbrush to the deeper, quieter, more mysterious parts of his mind\u2014and he paints pictures of what he sees and feels down there.\n\u201cThis accounts for the pleasurable shock of recognition we experience when we look at what he does.\n\u201cHow nice!\n\u201cHooray for Syd Solomon! I say. He is certainly more enterprising and useful than all the quack holy men who meditate deeply, who then announce smugly that it is impossible for them to express what they have seen and felt.\n\u201cThe heck with inarticulate meditators! And three cheers for all artists who dare to show and tell.\n\u201cSince we are here to dedicate a library, let us especially applaud those artists we call writers. By golly, aren\u2019t writers wonderful? They don\u2019t just keep their meditations to themselves. They very commonly give themselves migraine headaches and ulcers, and destroy their livers and their marriages, too, doing their best to show and tell.\n\u201cI once learned how to be the other sort of meditator, the sort that doesn\u2019t show and tell.
