I have to offer you good jobs. I don\u2019t mind doing that, though, and I\u2019ll tell you why: She never told me to do anything that didn\u2019t turn out to be in the best interests of the company. I used to say that I never wanted to work for anybody, but working for Mrs. Jack Graham has been the greatest privilege of my life.\u201d He meant it.\nHe did not mind making us all vice-presidents. The company had seven hundred vice-presidents of this and that on the top level, the corporate level, alone. When you got out into the subsidiaries, of course, the whole business of presidents and vice-presidents started all over again.\n\u201cYou know what she looks like?\u201d Ubriaco wanted to know.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her recently,\u201d said Leen. This was an urbane lie. He had never seen her, which was a matter of public record. He would confess to me later that he did not even know how he had come to Mrs. Graham\u2019s attention. He thought she might have seen an article on him in the Diners Club magazine, which had featured him in their \u201cMan on the Move\u201d department.\nIn any event, he was abjectly loyal to her. He loved and feared his idea of Mrs. Graham the way Emil Larkin loved and feared his idea of Jesus Christ. He was luckier than Larkin in his worship, of course, since the invisible superior being over him called him up and wrote him letters and told him what to do.\nHe actually said one time, \u201cWorking for Mrs. Graham has been a religious experience for me. I was adrift, no matter how much money I was making. My life had no purpose until I became president of RAMJAC and placed myself at her beck and call.\u201d\nAll happiness is religious, I have to think sometimes.\nLeen said he would talk to us one by one in his library. \u201cMrs. Graham didn\u2019t tell me about your backgrounds, what your special interests might be\u2014so you\u2019re just going to have to tell me about yourselves.\u201d He said for Ubriaco to come into the library first, and asked the rest of us to wait in the living room. \u201cIs there anything my butler can bring you to drink?\u201d he said.\nClewes didn\u2019t want anything. Edel asked for a beer. I, still hoping to blow the dream wide open, ordered a pousse-caf\u00e9, a rainbow-colored drink that I had never seen, but which I had studied while earning my Doctor of Mixology degree. A heavy liqueur was put into the bottom of the glass, then a lighter one of a different color was carefully spooned in on top of that, and then a lighter one still on top of that, and on and on, with each bright layer undisturbed by the one above or below.\nLeen was impressed with my order.

And, coming from the Hamming heat into that chilliness, I sneezed.\nThere were fresh flowers on my bedside table, but my bed had not yet been made. There wasn\u2019t even a pillow on the bed. There was simply a bare, brand-new Beautyrest mattress. And there weren\u2019t any coat hangers in the closet; and there wasn\u2019t any toilet paper in the bathroom.\nSo I went out in the corridor to see if there was a chambermaid who would equip me a little more completely. There wasn\u2019t anybody out there, but there was a door open at the far end and very faint sounds of life.\nI went to this door and found a large suite paved with dropcloths.

The Art World certainly wasn\u2019t any the poorer for what he had done. I had the obvious thought: \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle he didn\u2019t slash his wrists as well.\u201d\nThis was a great big beautiful Anglo-Saxon sleeping there, like Fred Jones a model for a Dan Gregory illustration of a story about an ideal American hero. And when he and I went places together, we really did look like Jones and Gregory. Not only that, but Kitchen treated me as respectfully as Fred had treated Gregory, which was preposterous! Fred had been a genuine, dumb, sweet lunk, whereas my own buddy, sleeping there, was a graduate of Yale Law School, could have been a professional pianist or tennis player or golfer.\nHe had inherited a world of talent along with that straight razor. His father was a first-rate cellist and chess player and horticulturalist, as well as a corporation lawyer and a pioneer in winning civil rights for the black people.\nMy sleeping buddy had also outranked me in the Army, as a lieutenant colonel in the Paratroops, and in deeds of derring-do! But he chose to stand in awe of me because I could do one thing he could never do, which was to draw or paint a likeness of anything my eye could see.\nAs for my own work there in the studio, the big fields of color before which I could stand intoxicated for hour after hour: they were meant to be beginnings. I expected them to become more and more complicated as I slowly but surely closed in on what had so long eluded me: soul, soul, soul.\nI woke him up, and said I would buy him an early supper at the Cedar Tavern. I didn\u2019t tell him about the big deal I had pulled off in Florence, since he couldn\u2019t be a part of it. He wouldn\u2019t get his hands on the spray rig for two more days.\nWhen the Contessa Portomaggiore died, incidentally, her collection would include sixteen Terry Kitchens.\n\u201cEarly supper\u201d meant early drinking too. There were already three painters at what had become our regular table in the back. I will call them \u201cPainters X, Y and Z.\u201d And, lest I give aid and comfort to Philistines eager to hear that the first Abstract Expressionists were a bunch of drunks and wild men, let me say who these three weren\u2019t.", 0.12681400039354584], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["door", 0.07017543859649122], ["weems", 0.05263157894736842], ["carney", 0.03508771929824561], ["foltz", 0.03508771929824561], ["roll", 0.03508771929824561], ["ballroom", 0.03508771929824561], ["fred", 0.03508771929824561], ["remembering", 0.017543859649122806], ["help", 0.017543859649122806], ["cried", 0.017543859649122806], ["mirrors", 0.017543859649122806], ["poised", 0.017543859649122806], ["yells", 0.017543859649122806], ["lips", 0.017543859649122806], ["farewell", 0.017543859649122806], ["mirror", 0.017543859649122806], ["open", 0.017543859649122806], ["staircase", 0.017543859649122806], ["dying", 0.017543859649122806], ["thinking", 0.017543859649122806], ["god", 0.017543859649122806], ["people", 0.017543859649122806], ["going", 0.017543859649122806], ["crack", 0.017543859649122806], ["stepped", 0.017543859649122806], ["bye", 0.017543859649122806], ["leaned", 0.017543859649122806], ["ripped", 0.017543859649122806], ["good", 0.017543859649122806], ["late", 0.017543859649122806], ["glass", 0.017543859649122806], ["bullets", 0.017543859649122806], ["shattering", 0.017543859649122806], ["stairs", 0.017543859649122806], ["white", 0.017543859649122806], ["magic", 0.017543859649122806], ["broken", 0.017543859649122806], ["pandemonium", 0.017543859649122806], ["side", 0.017543859649122806], ["lifeless", 0.017543859649122806], ["silence", 0.017543859649122806], ["shots", 0.017543859649122806], ["time", 0.017543859649122806], ["nice", 0.017543859649122806], ["sank", 0.017543859649122806], ["waited", 0.017543859649122806], ["left", 0.017543859649122806]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThere he goes!\u201d cried Foltz.\n\u201cLike going through a door!\u201d said Carney.\n\u201cGod help us!\u201d said Fred.\nWeems stepped out of the ballroom and onto the stairs.

in the Universe,\u201d the scientist promised, \u201cour seed will find it and bloom.\u201d\nOne of the most depressing things about the space program so far, of course, was that it had demonstrated that fecundity was one hell of a long way off, if anywhere. Dumb people like Dwayne and Grace, and even fairly smart people like the sheriff, had been encouraged to believe that there was hospitality out there, and that Earth was just a piece of shit to use as a launching platform.\nNow Earth really was a piece of shit, and it was beginning to dawn on even dumb people that it might be the only inhabitable planet human beings would ever find.\nGrace was in tears over being sued by her daughter, and the list of charges she was reading was broken into multiple images by the tears. \u201cOh God, oh God, oh God\u2014\u201d she said, \u201cshe\u2019s talking about things I forgot all about, but she never forgot a thing. She\u2019s talking about something that happened when she was only four years old.\u201d\nDwayne was reading charges against himself, so he didn\u2019t ask Grace what awful thing she was supposed to have done when Wanda June was only four, but here it was: Poor little Wanda June drew pretty pictures with a crayon all over the new living-room wallpaper to make her mother happy. Her mother blew up and spanked her instead. Since that day, Wanda June claimed, she had not been able to look at any sort of art materials without trembling like a leaf and breaking out into cold sweats. \u201cThus was I deprived,\u201d Wanda June\u2019s lawyer had her say, \u201cof a brilliant and lucrative career in the arts.\u201d\nDwayne meanwhile was learning that he had ruined his daughter\u2019s opportunities for what her lawyer called an \u201cadvantageous marriage and the comfort and love therefrom.\u201d Dwayne had done this, supposedly, by being half in the bag whenever a suitor came to call. Also, he was often stripped to the waist when he answered the door, but still had on his cartridge belt and his revolver. She was even able to name a lover her father had lost for her: John L. Newcomb, who had finally married somebody else. He had a very good job now. He was in command of the security force at an arsenal out in South Dakota, where they stockpiled cholera and bubonic plague.\nThe sheriff had still more bad news to deliver, and he knew he would have an opportunity to deliver it soon enough. Poor Dwayne and Grace were bound to ask him, \u201cWhat made her do this to us?\u201d The answer to that question would be more bad news, which was that Wanda June was in jail, charged with being the head of a shoplifting ring. The only way she could avoid prison was to prove that everything she was and did was her parents\u2019 fault.\nMeanwhile, Senator Flem Snopes of Mississippi, Chairman of the Senate Space Committee, had appeared on the television screen. He was very happy about the Big Space Fuck, and he said it had been what the American space program had been aiming toward all along. He was proud, he said, that the United States had seen fit to locate the biggest jizzum-freezing plant in his \u2019I\u2019il ol\u2019 home town,\u201d which was Mayhew.\nThe word \u201cjizzum\u201d had an interesting history, by the way. It was as old as \u201cfuck\u201d and \u201cshit\u201d and so on, but it continued to be excluded from dictionaries, long after the others were let in. This was because so many people wanted it to remain a truly magic word\u2014the only one left.\nAnd when the United States announced that it was going to do a truly magical thing, was going to fire sperm at the Andromeda Galaxy, the populace corrected its government. Their collective unconscious announced that it was time for the last magic word to come into the open. They insisted that sperm was nothing to fire at another galaxy. Only jizzum would do. So the Government began using that word, and it did something that had never been done before, either: it standardized the way the word was spelled.", 0.08648150334513972], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["people", 0.02586206896551724], ["convicts", 0.02586206896551724], ["tb", 0.017241379310344827], ["government", 0.017241379310344827], ["common", 0.017241379310344827], ["prisons", 0.017241379310344827], ["trustees", 0.017241379310344827], ["body", 0.017241379310344827], ["country", 0.017241379310344827], ["wealth", 0.017241379310344827], ["shells", 0.017241379310344827], ["form", 0.017241379310344827], ["managed", 0.008620689655172414], ["money", 0.008620689655172414], ["accurate", 0.008620689655172414], ["devastators", 0.008620689655172414], ["matsumoto", 0.008620689655172414], ["brain", 0.008620689655172414], ["paper", 0.008620689655172414], ["including", 0.008620689655172414], ["stores", 0.008620689655172414], ["thieves", 0.008620689655172414], ["easy", 0.008620689655172414], ["prison", 0.008620689655172414], ["circle", 0.008620689655172414], ["worse", 0.008620689655172414], ["walls", 0.008620689655172414], ["communities", 0.008620689655172414], ["cheerful", 0.008620689655172414], ["die", 0.008620689655172414], ["seldom", 0.008620689655172414], ["52", 0.008620689655172414], ["bad", 0.008620689655172414], ["inside", 0.008620689655172414], ["street", 0.008620689655172414], ["gladiator", 0.008620689655172414], ["wire", 0.008620689655172414], ["merchandising", 0.008620689655172414], ["townies", 0.008620689655172414], ["cough", 0.008620689655172414], ["busting", 0.008620689655172414], ["protect", 0.008620689655172414], ["robberies", 0.008620689655172414], ["place", 0.008620689655172414], ["gunfights", 0.008620689655172414], ["mad", 0.008620689655172414], ["duty", 0.008620689655172414], ["auschwitz", 0.008620689655172414], ["jesus", 0.008620689655172414], ["impossible", 0.008620689655172414], ["lesson", 0.008620689655172414], ["negotiable", 0.008620689655172414], ["devastation", 0.008620689655172414], ["strong", 0.008620689655172414], ["fast", 0.008620689655172414], ["lot", 0.008620689655172414], ["rapes", 0.008620689655172414], ["athena", 0.008620689655172414], ["controlled", 0.008620689655172414], ["germs", 0.008620689655172414], ["convert", 0.008620689655172414], ["enterprises", 0.008620689655172414], ["chemicals", 0.008620689655172414], ["understand", 0.008620689655172414], ["factories", 0.008620689655172414], ["builds", 0.008620689655172414], ["rage", 0.008620689655172414], ["originally", 0.008620689655172414], ["will", 0.008620689655172414], ["calcium", 0.008620689655172414], ["classes", 0.008620689655172414], ["making", 0.008620689655172414], ["escapes", 0.008620689655172414], ["reminders", 0.008620689655172414], ["abstract", 0.008620689655172414], ["moved", 0.008620689655172414], ["mine", 0.008620689655172414], ["stratosphere", 0.008620689655172414], ["caused", 0.008620689655172414], ["ringed", 0.008620689655172414], ["huge", 0.008620689655172414], ["spartacus", 0.008620689655172414], ["responsible", 0.008620689655172414], ["relatives", 0.008620689655172414], ["build", 0.008620689655172414], ["barbed", 0.008620689655172414], ["bombardiers", 0.008620689655172414], ["clearer", 0.008620689655172414], ["demanding", 0.008620689655172414], ["000", 0.008620689655172414], ["warden", 0.008620689655172414], ["coming", 0.008620689655172414], ["representations", 0.008620689655172414], ["friends", 0.008620689655172414], ["lower", 0.008620689655172414], ["liquid", 0.008620689655172414], ["attempting", 0.008620689655172414], ["crucifixions", 0.008620689655172414], ["element", 0.008620689655172414], ["person", 0.008620689655172414], ["portion", 0.008620689655172414], ["slaves", 0.008620689655172414]], "sentiment": ["What Warden Matsumoto had said about people like them was accurate.

They were mad at the Government for not making sure that escapes from prison were impossible. The more they ran on like that, the clearer it became that it was their Government, not mine or the convicts\u2019 or the Townies\u2019.

The shells are calcium, the most common element in the walls of many prisons, including Athena. This place is ringed by barbed wire. So was Auschwitz.\nIf I die of TB, it will be because my body could not build prisons fast enough and strong enough.\nIs there a lesson there? Not a cheerful one.\nIF THE TRUSTEES were bad, the convicts were worse. I would be the last person to say otherwise.

I will never know why. It was nothing I did on my end. It could have been caused by something the mouse on my end did. The mouse had gone away. It could have been fooling with the telephone wires in the wall. Or maybe, in the basement of my brother\u2019s building in New York City, somebody was putting a tap on his line. Maybe a private detective, working for his wife, wanted to get the goods on him\u2014to be used in a divorce action later on. Anything is possible.\nThen the telephone came alive again. Felix was talking about coming home to Midland City to rediscover his roots. He said the exact opposite of what Bunny Hoover had said to me. He said that everybody in New York City was phony, and that it was the people of Midland City who were real. He named a lot of friends from high school. He was going to drink beer with them and go hunting with them.\nHe mentioned some girls, too. It wasn\u2019t quite clear what he could do with them, since they were all married, and had children, or had left town. But he didn\u2019t mention Celia Hoover, and I didn\u2019t remind him of her\u2014didn\u2019t tell him that she had become a crazy old bat, and that she had just taken the drugstore apart.\nIt\u2019s interesting that he didn\u2019t mention Celia for this reason: He would later declare, under the influence of drugs a doctor had prescribed for him, that she was the only woman he had ever loved, and that he should have married her.\nCelia was dead by then.\n24\nI WOULD BE GLAD to attempt a detailed analysis of Celia Hoover\u2019s character, if I thought her character had much of anything to do with her suicide by Drno. As a pharmacist, though, I see no reason not to give full credit to amphetamine.\nHere is the warning which the law requires as a companion now for each shipment of amphetamine as it leaves the factory:\n\u201cAmphetamine has been extensively abused.

\u2026\nMY LAWYER HERE in Jerusalem, Mr. Alvin Dobrowitz, has told me that I would surely win my case if I could produce one witness who had seen me in the company of the man known to me as Colonel Frank Wirtanen.\nI met Wirtanen three times: before the war, immediately after the war, and finally, in the back of a vacant store across the street from the residence of The Reverend Doctor Lionel J. D. Jones, D.D.S., D.D. Only at the first meeting, the meeting on the park bench, did anyone see us together. And those who saw us were no more likely to fix us in their memories than were the squirrels and birds.\nThe second time I met him was in Wiesbaden, Germany, in the dining hall of what had once been an officers\u2019 candidate school of the Engineers Corps of the Wehrmacht. There was a great mural on the wall of that dining hall, a tank coming down a lovely, winding country lane. The sun was shining in the mural. The sky was clear. This bucolic scene was about to be shattered.\nIn a thicket, in the foreground of the mural, was a merry little band of steel-helmeted Robin Hoods, engineers whose latest prank was to mine the lane and to implement the impending merriment with an anti-tank gun and a light machine gun.\nThey were so happy.\nHow did I get to Wiesbaden?\nI was taken from a Third Army prisoner-of-war pen near Ohrdruf on April 15, three days after my capture by Lieutenant Bernard B. O\u2019Hare.\nI was driven to Wiesbaden in a jeep, was guarded by a first lieutenant whose name is unknown to me. We didn\u2019t talk much. I did not interest him. He spent the entire trip in a slow-smoldering rage about something that had nothing to do with me. Had he been slighted, insulted, cheated, maligned, grievously misunderstood?
