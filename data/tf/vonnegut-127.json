[\u2026]\nMy publishing plans are these: (1) to deliver a book I owe to Holt for a small advance, and (2) look around.\nThe Holt book is going slowly, since I have a heavy teaching load out here and am vaguely screwed up. Maybe it will be done in about six months. I sure hope so.\nA good movie deal is just now pending. I have also put in for a Guggenheim. If either one pans out, I will become a full-time writer again.\nIf you have a proposition, you might tell my agent about it.

Sadism, of course, is joy while inflicting pain on others. Sadomasochism means getting one\u2019s rocks off while hurting others, while being hurt by others, or while hurting oneself.\nBorden said doing without those words nowadays was like trying to talk about life without words for beer or water.\nThe only contemporary American writer we could think of who had given us a new word, and surely not because he is a famous pervert, which he isn\u2019t, was Joseph Heller. The title of his first novel, Catch-22, is defined this way in my Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary: \u201cA problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem.\u201d\nRead the book!\nI told Borden what Heller said in an interview when he was asked if he feared death. Heller said he had never experienced a root-canal job. Many people he knew had. From what they told him about it, Heller said, he guessed he, too, could stand one, if he had to.\nThat was how he felt about death, he said.\nThat puts me in mind of a scene from a play of George Bernard Shaw\u2019s, his manmade timequake Back to Methuselah. The whole play is ten hours long! The last time it was performed in its entirety was in 1922, the year I was born.\nThe scene: Adam and Eve, who have been around for a long time now, are waiting at the gate of their prosperous and peaceful and beautiful farm for the annual visit from their landlord, God. During every previous visit, and there have been hundreds of them by now, they could tell Him only that everything was nice and that they were grateful.\nThis time, though, Adam and Eve are all keyed up, scared but proud. They have something new they want to talk to God about. So God shows up, genial, big and hale and hearty, like my grandfather the brewer Albert Lieber. He asks if everything is satisfactory, and thinks He knows the answer, since what He has created is as perfect as He can make it.", 0.18436520376175553], "title": "Timequake"},

When he spoke, it was in the tone of the pedant once more, the wielder of profundities. \"No, I won\u2019t take the boy. I feel as Pi Ying felt about you\u2014that you, as Americans, are the enemy, whether an official state of war exists or not. I look upon you as prisoners of war.\n\"However, as long as there is no official state of war, I have no choice, as a representative of my government, but to see that all of you are conducted safely through the lines. This was my plan when I resumed the game where Pi Ying left off. Your being freed has nothing to do with my personal feelings, nor with the outcome of the game. My winning would have delighted me and taught you a valuable lesson. But it would have made no difference in your fates.\" He lighted his cigarette and continued to look at them with severity.\n\"That\u2019s very chivalrous of you, Major,\" said Kelly.\n\"A matter of practical politics, I assure you. It wouldn\u2019t do to precipitate an incident between our countries just now. For a Russian to be chivalrous with an American is a spiritual impossibility, a contradiction in terms. In a long and bitter history, we\u2019ve learned and learned well to reserve our chivalry for Russians.\" His expression became one of complete contempt. \"Perhaps you\u2019d like to play another game, Colonel\u2014plain chess with wooden chessmen, without Pi Ying\u2019s refinement.

She blabbed hysterically about Billy and the airplane crash, and then she put her car in gear and crossed the median divider, leaving her exhaust system behind.\nWhen she arrived at the hospital, people rushed to the windows to see what all the noise was. The Cadillac, with both mufflers gone, sounded like a heavy bomber coming in on a wing and a prayer. Valencia turned off the engine, but then she slumped against the steering wheel, and the horn brayed steadily. A doctor and a nurse ran out to find out what the trouble was. Poor Valencia was unconscious, overcome by carbon monoxide. She was a heavenly azure.\nOne hour later she was dead. So it goes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBilly knew nothing about it. He dreamed on, and traveled in time and so forth. The hospital was so crowded that Billy couldn\u2019t have a room to himself. He shared a room with a Harvard history professor named Bertram Copeland Rumfoord. Rumfoord didn\u2019t have to look at Billy, because Billy was surrounded by white linen screens on rubber wheels. But Rumfoord could hear Billy talking to himself from time to time.\nRumfoord\u2019s left leg was in traction. He had broken it while skiing. He was seventy years old, but had the body and spirit of a man half that age. He had been honeymooning with his fifth wife when he broke his leg. Her name was Lily. Lily was twenty-three.\nJust about the time poor Valencia was pronounced dead, Lily came into Billy\u2019s and Rumfoord\u2019s room with an armload of books. Rumfoord had sent her down to Boston to get them. He was working on a one-volume history of the United States Army Air Corps in World War Two. The books were about bombings and sky battles that had happened before Lily was even born.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cYou guys go on without me,\u201d said Billy Pilgrim deliriously, as pretty little Lily came in. She had been an a-go-go girl when Rumfoord saw her and resolved to make her his own. She was a high school dropout. Her I.Q. was 103. \u201cHe scares me,\u201d she whispered to her husband about Billy Pilgrim.\n\u201cHe bores the hell out of me!\u201d Rumfoord replied boomingly. \u201cAll he does in his sleep is quit and surrender and apologize and ask to be left alone.\u201d Rumfoord was a retired brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve, the official Air Force Historian, a full professor, the author of twenty-six books, a multimillionaire since birth, and one of the great competitive sailors of all time. His most popular book was about sex and strenuous athletics for men over sixty-five.

His mother and father had also been good-looking. He was from a good-looking family. Despite the fact that it was so hot, *Wait would not take off his shirt\u2014because he was so ashamed of all the scars he had from punishments inflicted by various foster parents. Later, when he was a prostitute on the island of Manhattan, his clients would find those scars, made by cigarettes and coat hangers and belt buckles and so on, very exciting.\n*Wait was not looking for sexual opportunities. He had just about made up his mind to light out for Manhattan, and he did not want to do anything which might give the police an excuse for locking him up. He was well known to the police, who frequently questioned him about this or that burglary or whatever, although he had never committed an actual crime. The police were always watching him anyway. They would say to him things like \u201cSooner or later, Sonny, you\u2019re going to make a big mistake.\u201d\nSo Mrs. Hoover appeared in the front door in a skimpy bathing suit. There was a swimming pool out back. Her face was all raddled and addled, and her teeth were bad, but she still had a very beautiful figure. She asked him if he wouldn\u2019t like to come into the house, which was air-conditioned, and cool off with a glass of ice tea or lemonade.\nThe next thing *Wait knew, they were having sex in there, and she was saying they were two of a kind, both of them lost, and kissing his scars and so on.\nMrs. Hoover conceived, and gave birth to a son nine months later, which Mr. Hoover believed to be his own. It was a good-looking boy, who would grow up to be a good dancer and very musical, just like *Wait.\n*Wait heard about the baby after he moved to Manhattan, but he could never consider it a relative. He would go years without thinking about it. And then his big brain would suddenly tell him for no good reason that somewhere in the world there was this young male walking around who wouldn\u2019t be in this world, if it weren\u2019t for him. It would make him feel creepy. That was much too big a result for such a little accident.\nWhy would he have wanted a son back then? It was the farthest thing from his mind.\nThe sexual prime for human males today, incidentally, comes at the age of six or so. When a six-year-old comes across a female in heat, there is no stopping him from engaging in sexual intercourse.\nAnd I pity him, because I can still remember what I was like when I was sixteen. It was hell to be that excited. Then as now, orgasms gave no relief. Ten minutes after an orgasm, guess what? Nothing would do but that you have another one. And there was homework besides!\n4", 0.10722868217054264], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["genius", 0.034482758620689655], ["slazinger", 0.02586206896551724], ["working", 0.02586206896551724], ["ideas", 0.02586206896551724], ["good", 0.017241379310344827], ["read", 0.017241379310344827], ["team", 0.017241379310344827], ["revolution", 0.017241379310344827], ["fail", 0.017241379310344827], ["york", 0.017241379310344827], ["times", 0.017241379310344827], ["three", 0.017241379310344827], ["life", 0.017241379310344827], ["specialists", 0.017241379310344827], ["person", 0.017241379310344827], ["ludicrous", 0.008620689655172414], ["midnight", 0.008620689655172414], ["years", 0.008620689655172414], ["yearn", 0.008620689655172414], ["human", 0.008620689655172414], ["invariably", 0.008620689655172414], ["paul", 0.008620689655172414], ["find", 0.008620689655172414], ["title", 0.008620689655172414], ["writing", 0.008620689655172414], ["citizen", 0.008620689655172414], ["worth", 0.008620689655172414], ["lunatic", 0.008620689655172414], ["seemingly", 0.008620689655172414], ["downright", 0.008620689655172414], ["learned", 0.008620689655172414], ["consist", 0.008620689655172414], ["shapes", 0.008620689655172414], ["clothes", 0.008620689655172414], ["ignored", 0.008620689655172414], ["people", 0.008620689655172414], ["second", 0.008620689655172414], ["dumb", 0.008620689655172414], ["strawberry", 0.008620689655172414], ["sorts", 0.008620689655172414], ["told", 0.008620689655172414], ["specialist", 0.008620689655172414], ["opening", 0.008620689655172414], ["activity", 0.008620689655172414], ["universe", 0.008620689655172414], ["minds", 0.008620689655172414], ["loud", 0.008620689655172414], ["fresh", 0.008620689655172414], ["community", 0.008620689655172414], ["highly", 0.008620689655172414], ["brought", 0.008620689655172414], ["open", 0.008620689655172414], ["standing", 0.008620689655172414], ["arts", 0.008620689655172414], ["capable", 0.008620689655172414], ["trillion", 0.008620689655172414], ["eleven", 0.008620689655172414], ["lot", 0.008620689655172414], ["painful", 0.008620689655172414], ["sort", 0.008620689655172414], ["field", 0.008620689655172414], ["successful", 0.008620689655172414], ["exploded", 0.008620689655172414], ["exactly", 0.008620689655172414], ["volume", 0.008620689655172414], ["testifies", 0.008620689655172414], ["unrealistic", 0.008620689655172414], ["peculiar", 0.008620689655172414], ["circulation", 0.008620689655172414], ["work", 0.008620689655172414], ["easier", 0.008620689655172414], ["will", 0.008620689655172414], ["matter", 0.008620689655172414], ["minutes", 0.008620689655172414], ["history", 0.008620689655172414], ["pound", 0.008620689655172414], ["unjust", 0.008620689655172414], ["mind", 0.008620689655172414], ["general", 0.008620689655172414], ["nonfiction", 0.008620689655172414], ["admires", 0.008620689655172414], ["politics", 0.008620689655172414], ["began", 0.008620689655172414], ["sciences", 0.008620689655172414], ["intelligent", 0.008620689655172414], ["day", 0.008620689655172414], ["rarest", 0.008620689655172414], ["membership", 0.008620689655172414], ["mad", 0.008620689655172414], ["serious", 0.008620689655172414], ["authentic", 0.008620689655172414], ["ago", 0.008620689655172414], ["understands", 0.008620689655172414], ["changes", 0.008620689655172414], ["materials", 0.008620689655172414], ["claims", 0.008620689655172414]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWhy ask me?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou read The New York Times every day,\u201d she said.\nSo I told her that the Universe began as an eleven-pound strawberry which exploded at seven minutes past midnight three trillion years ago.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d she said.\n\u201cAll I can tell you is what I read in The New York Times,\u201d I said.\nPaul Slazinger has had all his clothes and writing materials brought here. He is working on his first volume of nonfiction, to which he has given this title: The Only Way to Have a Successful Revolution in Any Field of Human Activity.\nFor what it is worth: Slazinger claims to have learned from history that most people cannot open their minds to new ideas unless a mind-opening team with a peculiar membership goes to work on them. Otherwise, life will go on exactly as before, no matter how painful, unrealistic, unjust, ludicrous, or downright dumb that life may be.\nThe team must consist of three sorts of specialists, he says. Otherwise, the revolution, whether in politics or the arts or the sciences or whatever, is sure to fail.\nThe rarest of these specialists, he says, is an authentic genius\u2014a person capable of having seemingly good ideas not in general circulation. \u201cA genius working alone,\u201d he says, \u201cis invariably ignored as a lunatic.\u201d\nThe second sort of specialist is a lot easier to find: a highly intelligent citizen in good standing in his or her community, who understands and admires the fresh ideas of the genius, and who testifies that the genius is far from mad. \u201cA

Only two major subjects remain to be covered: loneliness and boredom. No matter how old we are, we are going to be bored and lonely during what remains of our lives.\n\u201cWe are so lonely because we don\u2019t have enough friends and relatives. Human beings are supposed to live in stable, like-minded, extended families of fifty people or more. In Nigeria it\u2019s common for Ibos to have a thousand relatives who know them quite well. When a baby is born, it is taken on a long trip, so it can meet all its relatives. This sort of thing is still quite common in Europe today, although the number one-thousand is far too high for there. When we or our ancestors came to America, though, we were agreeing, among other things, to do without such families. It is a painful, unhuman agreement to make. Emotionally, it is hideously expensive.\n\u201cYour class spokesperson mourned the collapse of the institution of marriage in this country. Marriage is collapsing because our families are too small. A man cannot be a whole society to a woman, and a woman cannot be a whole society to a man. We try, but it is scarcely surprising that so many of us go to pieces.\n\u201cSo I recommend that everybody here join all sorts of organizations, no matter how ridiculous, simply to get more people in his or her life. It does not matter much if all the other members are morons. Quantities of relatives of any sort are what we need.\n\u201cAs for boredom: Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, a German philosopher who died seventy-eight years ago, had this to say: \u2019Against boredom even the gods contend in vain.\u2019 We are supposed to be bored. It is a part of life. Learn to put up with it, or you will not be what I have declared the members of this graduating class to be: mature women and men.\n\u201cI come to a close now by noting that the news magazines, whose business is to know and understand everything, have found this year\u2019s graduates to be apathetic. This year\u2019s graduates have tired blood. They need Geritol. Well, as a member of a zippier generation, with sparkle in its eyes and a snap in its stride, let me tell you what kept us as high as kites a lot of the time: hatred. All my life I\u2019ve had people to hate\u2014from Hitler to Nixon, not that those two are at all comparable in their villainy. It is a tragedy, perhaps, that human beings can get so much energy and enthusiasm from hate. If you want to feel ten feet tall, as though you could run a hundred miles without stopping, hate beats pure cocaine any day. Hitler resurrected Germany, a beaten, bankrupt, half-starved nation, with hatred and nothing more. Imagine that.\n\u201cSo it seems quite likely to me that the class of 1978 in the United States of America is not in fact apathetic, but only looks that way to people who are used to getting their ecstasies from hatred. The members of the class of 1978 are not sleepy, are not listless, are not apathetic. They are simply performing the experiment of doing without hate. Hate is the missing vitamin in their diet, and they have sensed correctly that hate, in the long run, is about as nourishing as cyanide.\n\u201cThis is a very exciting thing they are doing, and I wish them well.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOne reason I feel the need to be funnier on paper than most of my colleagues is that I have a German name, which can be counted on to remind almost any sort of American for at least a microsecond of German enemies in two world wars. I myself, a prisoner of war of the Germans, am so reminded for at least that microsecond when I hear a German name.

One of her duties as a widow, she had learned, was to provide dramatic proof to the neighboring wives that, bad as their husbands might be at times, life without them would be worse.\nAnnie didn\u2019t spoil this illusion for Doris June by telling her about the letters\u2014telling her what she had discovered so late in life about womanly happiness, telling her about one man, at least, who could make her happy from as far away as Schenectady.\nSometimes other women\u2019s husbands came to the farm, too, gruff and formal, to perform some man\u2019s chore that their wives had noticed needed doing\u2014patching a roof, putting a new packing in the pump, greasing the idle machinery in the barn. They knew she was a virtuous widow, and respected her severely for it. They hardly spoke.\nSometimes Annie wondered how the husbands would act if they knew about the letters. Maybe they would think she was a loose woman, then, and accept her formal invitations for coffee which were meant to be declined. They might even make remarks with double meanings and full of shy flirtation\u2014the sort of remarks they made to the shameless girl behind the coffee counter in the diner in town.\nIf she\u2019d shown the men the letters, they would have read something dirty into them, she thought, when the letters weren\u2019t at all like that, really. They were spiritual, they were poetry, and she didn\u2019t even know or care what the man who wrote them looked like.\nSometimes the minister came for a visit, too, a bleak, fleshless, dust-colored old man, who was overjoyed by her deathlike peace and moral safety.\n\u201cYou make me want to go on, Mrs. Cowper,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish you could talk to our young people sometime. They don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible for a person to live a Christian life in this modern day and age.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you,\u201d said Annie. \u201cI think all young people are kind of wild, and settle down later.

It wasn\u2019t the one containing the inkpad and her pens and paper and her will and all that. The shoe she took off was crammed with memorabilia. There were hypocritical love letters from me, as I\u2019ve said. But she was particularly eager for me to see a snapshot of what she called \u201c\u2026 my two favorite men.\u201d\nIt was a picture of my one-time idol, Kenneth Whistler, the Harvard-educated labor organizer, shaking hands with a small and goofy-looking college boy. The boy was myself. I had ears like a loving cup.\nThat was when the police finally came clumping in to get me.\n\u201cI\u2019ll rescue you, Walter,\u201d said Mary Kathleen. \u201cThen we\u2019ll rescue the world together.\u201d\nI was relieved to be getting away from her, frankly. I tried to seem regretful about our parting. \u201cTake care of yourself, Mary Kathleen,\u201d I said. \u201cIt looks like this is goodbye.\u201d\n17\nI HUNG THAT SNAPSHOT of Kenneth Whistler and myself, taken in the autumn of Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-five, dead center in the Great Depression, on my office wall at RAMJAC\u2014next to the circular about stolen clarinet parts. It was taken by Mary Kathleen, with my bellows camera, on the morning after we first heard Whistler speak. He had come all the way to Cambridge from Harlan County, Kentucky, where he was a miner and a union organizer, to address a rally whose purpose was to raise money and sympathy for the local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Abrasives and Adhesives Workers.\nThe union was run by communists then. It is run by gangsters now. As a matter of fact, the start of my prison sentence overlapped with the end of one being served at Finletter by the lifetime president of the I.B.A.A.W. His twenty-three-year-old daughter was running the union from her villa in the Bahamas while he was away. He was on the telephone to her all the time. He told me that the membership was almost entirely black and Hispanic now. It was lily-white back in the thirties\u2014Scandinavians mostly. I don\u2019t think a black or Hispanic would have been allowed to join back in the good old days.\nTimes change.", 0.17753623188405795], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["crosby", 0.06666666666666667], ["newt", 0.05555555555555555], ["pissants", 0.03333333333333333], ["hand", 0.03333333333333333], ["talking", 0.022222222222222223], ["feller", 0.022222222222222223], ["size", 0.022222222222222223], ["damn", 0.022222222222222223], ["men", 0.022222222222222223], ["affectionately", 0.022222222222222223], ["bar", 0.022222222222222223], ["spoke", 0.022222222222222223], ["shoulder", 0.022222222222222223], ["frankly", 0.022222222222222223], ["pissant", 0.022222222222222223], ["ding", 0.011111111111111112], ["real", 0.011111111111111112], ["adjusted", 0.011111111111111112], ["better", 0.011111111111111112], ["san", 0.011111111111111112], ["proposed", 0.011111111111111112], ["ham", 0.011111111111111112], ["seat", 0.011111111111111112], ["pleasantly", 0.011111111111111112], ["cups", 0.011111111111111112], ["thinks", 0.011111111111111112], ["physical", 0.011111111111111112], ["speak", 0.011111111111111112], ["gallant", 0.011111111111111112], ["provided", 0.011111111111111112], ["weight", 0.011111111111111112], ["cried", 0.011111111111111112], ["call", 0.011111111111111112], ["god", 0.011111111111111112], ["monstrous", 0.011111111111111112], ["strangers", 0.011111111111111112], ["lorenzo", 0.011111111111111112], ["pretty", 0.011111111111111112], ["sighted", 0.011111111111111112], ["drunkard", 0.011111111111111112], ["illusion", 0.011111111111111112], ["associations", 0.011111111111111112], ["toast", 0.011111111111111112], ["fellers", 0.011111111111111112], ["lowe", 0.011111111111111112], ["human", 0.011111111111111112], ["handicap", 0.011111111111111112], ["big", 0.011111111111111112], ["couple", 0.011111111111111112], ["humiliating", 0.011111111111111112], ["admiration", 0.011111111111111112], ["hoping", 0.011111111111111112], ["wives", 0.011111111111111112], ["sweethearts", 0.011111111111111112], ["ling", 0.011111111111111112], ["term", 0.011111111111111112], ["59", 0.011111111111111112], ["belts", 0.011111111111111112], ["straightened", 0.011111111111111112], ["shuddered", 0.011111111111111112], ["times", 0.011111111111111112], ["glancing", 0.011111111111111112], ["man", 0.011111111111111112], ["hung", 0.011111111111111112], ["fasten", 0.011111111111111112], ["commented", 0.011111111111111112]], "sentiment": ["He proposed a gallant toast. \u201cSweethearts and wives,\u201d he cried.\n59\nFASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS\nI WAS IN THE BAR with Newt and H.

["\u201cSiki?\u201d said the Shah.\n\u201cThis is EPICAC XIV,\u201d said Halyard. \u201cIt\u2019s an electronic computing machine\u2014a brain, if you like. This chamber alone, the smallest of the thirty-one used, contains enough wire to reach from here to the moon four times. There are more vacuum tubes in the entire instrument than there were vacuum tubes in the State of New York before World War II.\u201d He had recited these figures so often that he had no need for the descriptive pamphlet that was passed out to visitors.\nKhashdrahr told the Shah.\nThe Shah thought it over, snickered shyly, and Khashdrahr joined him in the quiet, Oriental merriment.\n\u201cShah said,\u201d said Khashdrahr, \u201cpeople in his land sleep with smart women and make good brains cheap. Save enough wire to go to moon a thousand times.\u201d\nHalyard chuckled appreciatively, as he was paid to do, wiped aside the tears engendered by his ulcer, and explained that cheap and easy brains were what was wrong with the world in the bad old days, and that EPICAC XIV could consider simultaneously hundreds or even thousands of sides of a question utterly fairly, that EPICAC XIV was wholly free of reason-muddying emotions, that EPICAC XIV never forgot anything\u2014that, in short, EPICAC XIV was dead right about everything. And Halyard added in his mind that the procedure described by the Shah had been tried about a trillion times, and had yet to produce a brain that could be relied upon to do the right thing once out of a hundred opportunities.\nThey were passing the oldest section of the computer now, what had been the whole of EPICAC I, but what was now little more than an appendix or tonsil of EPICAC XIV. Yet, EPICAC I had been intelligent enough, dispassionate enough, retentive enough to convince men that he, rather than they, had better do the planning for the war that was approaching with stupifying certainty. The ancient phrase used by generals testifying before appropriation committees, \u201call things considered,\u201d was given some validity by the ruminations of EPICAC I, more validity by EPICAC II, and so on, through the lengthening series. EPICAC could consider the merits of high-explosive bombs as opposed to atomic weapons for tactical support, and keep in mind at the same time the availability of explosives as opposed to fissionable materials, the spacing of enemy foxholes, the labor situation in the respective processing industries, the probable mortality of planes in the face of enemy antiaircraft technology, and on and on, if it seemed at all important, to the number of cigarettes and Cocoanut Mound Bars and Silver Stars required to support a high-morale air force. Given the facts by human beings, the war-born EPICAC series had offered the highly informed guidance that the reasonable, truth-loving, brilliant, and highly trained core of American genius could have delivered had they had inspired leadership, boundless resources, and two thousand years.\nThrough the war, and through the postwar years to the present, EPICAC\u2019s nervous system had been extended outward through Carlsbad Caverns\u2014intelligence bought by the foot and pound and kilowatt. With each addition, a new, unique individual had been born, and now Halyard, the Shah, and Khashdrahr were arriving at the bunting-covered platform, where the President of the United States of America, Jonathan Lynn, would dedicate to a happier, more efficient tomorrow, EPICAC XIV.\nThe trio sat down on folding chairs and waited quietly with the rest of the distinguished company. Whenever there was a break in the group\u2019s whispering, EPICAC\u2019s hummings and clickings could be heard\u2014the sounds attendant to the flow of electrons, now augmenting one another, now blocking, shuttling through a maze of electromagnetic crises to a condition that was translatable from electrical qualities and quantities to a high grade of truth.\nEPICAC XIV, though undedicated, was already at work, deciding how many refrigerators, how many lamps, how many turbine-generators, how many hub caps, how many dinner plates, how many door knobs, how many rubber heels, how many television sets, how many pinochle decks\u2014how many everything America and her customers could have and how much they would cost. And it was EPICAC XIV who would decide for the coming years how many engineers and managers and research men and civil servants, and of what skills, would be needed in order to deliver the goods; and what I.Q. and aptitude levels would separate the useful men from the useless ones, and how many Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps men and how many soldiers could be supported at what pay level and where, and \u2026", 0.22628018631695102], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["helmholtz", 0.06923076923076923], ["selma", 0.046153846153846156], ["room", 0.03076923076923077], ["file", 0.03076923076923077], ["office", 0.023076923076923078], ["files", 0.023076923076923078], ["suite", 0.015384615384615385], ["lincoln", 0.015384615384615385], ["lunch", 0.015384615384615385], ["school", 0.015384615384615385], ["ritter", 0.015384615384615385], ["principal", 0.015384615384615385], ["card", 0.015384615384615385], ["secrets", 0.015384615384615385], ["caught", 0.015384615384615385], ["switchboard", 0.015384615384615385], ["high", 0.015384615384615385], ["numbers", 0.015384615384615385], ["impression", 0.007692307692307693], ["secrecy", 0.007692307692307693], ["scattered", 0.007692307692307693], ["precarious", 0.007692307692307693], ["sociability", 0.007692307692307693], ["switches", 0.007692307692307693], ["shocked", 0.007692307692307693], ["human", 0.007692307692307693], ["kneeling", 0.007692307692307693], ["staff", 0.007692307692307693], ["glimpse", 0.007692307692307693], ["concerned", 0.007692307692307693], ["writing", 0.007692307692307693], ["program", 0.007692307692307693], ["meant", 0.007692307692307693], ["random", 0.007692307692307693], ["confidential", 0.007692307692307693], ["seemingly", 0.007692307692307693], ["hands", 0.007692307692307693], ["peeked", 0.007692307692307693], ["lost", 0.007692307692307693], ["fields", 0.007692307692307693], ["offices", 0.007692307692307693], ["kneel", 0.007692307692307693], ["side", 0.007692307692307693], ["view", 0.007692307692307693], ["dexterity", 0.007692307692307693], ["accomplishment", 0.007692307692307693], ["weight", 0.007692307692307693], ["testing", 0.007692307692307693], ["jump", 0.007692307692307693], ["individual", 0.007692307692307693], ["buzzed", 0.007692307692307693], ["aptitudes", 0.007692307692307693], ["preferences", 0.007692307692307693], ["literally", 0.007692307692307693], ["consisting", 0.007692307692307693], ["red", 0.007692307692307693], ["told", 0.007692307692307693], ["noise", 0.007692307692307693], ["business", 0.007692307692307693], ["blinked", 0.007692307692307693], ["leadership", 0.007692307692307693], ["represented", 0.007692307692307693], ["reason", 0.007692307692307693], ["quietly", 0.007692307692307693], ["simple", 0.007692307692307693], ["height", 0.007692307692307693], ["wasn", 0.007692307692307693], ["open", 0.007692307692307693], ["unexplained", 0.007692307692307693], ["toppled", 0.007692307692307693], ["futility", 0.007692307692307693], ["entered", 0.007692307692307693], ["meeting", 0.007692307692307693], ["dismal", 0.007692307692307693], ["crane", 0.007692307692307693], ["hour", 0.007692307692307693], ["drawer", 0.007692307692307693], ["work", 0.007692307692307693], ["weren", 0.007692307692307693], ["balance", 0.007692307692307693], ["thorough", 0.007692307692307693], ["helped", 0.007692307692307693], ["heard", 0.007692307692307693], ["mouse", 0.007692307692307693], ["excused", 0.007692307692307693], ["things", 0.007692307692307693], ["holds", 0.007692307692307693], ["handed", 0.007692307692307693], ["potential", 0.007692307692307693], ["copying", 0.007692307692307693], ["conclusion", 0.007692307692307693], ["notebook", 0.007692307692307693], ["deserted", 0.007692307692307693], ["foyer", 0.007692307692307693], ["talk", 0.007692307692307693]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWhat does she do during the lunch hour?\u201d said Helmholtz.\n\u201cShe holds down the switchboard in the principal\u2019s office,\u201d said Crane, \u201cwhile the staff is out to lunch.\u201d\nHelmholtz excused himself, and he went to the principal\u2019s office to have a talk with Selma Ritter. The office was actually a suite, consisting of a foyer, a meeting room, two offices, and a file room.\nWhen Helmholtz entered the suite, his first impression was that there was no one in it. The switchboard was deserted. The switches buzzed and blinked in dismal futility.\nAnd then Helmholtz heard what was little more than a mouse noise in the file room. He went to the room quietly, peeked in.\nSelma Ritter was kneeling by an open file drawer, writing something in her notebook.\nHelmholtz was not shocked. He didn\u2019t jump to the conclusion that Selma was looking into something that wasn\u2019t any of her business\u2014for the simple reason that he didn\u2019t believe in secrets. As far as Helmholtz was concerned, there weren\u2019t any secrets in Lincoln High School.\nSelma took a rather different view of secrecy. What she had her hands in were the confidential files, the files that told, among other things, what everyone\u2019s I.Q. was. When Helmholtz caught her red-handed, Selma literally lost her balance, toppled to one side from her precarious kneel.\nHelmholtz helped her up. And while he was doing it, he caught a glimpse of the file card Selma had been copying from. The card had unexplained numbers scattered over it, seemingly at random.\nThe numbers meant nothing to Helmholtz, since he had never used the files. They represented not only an individual\u2019s I.Q. but his sociability index, his dexterity, his weight, his leadership potential, his height, his work preferences, and his aptitudes in six different fields of human accomplishment.

I hadn\u2019t realized that he and she had been an item when they were both at Tarkington, but I guess they were. She certainly never told me about it. At any rate, when I was working over at Athena, I got an announcement of their impending wedding down there, forwarded from Scipio.\nBut evidently that fell through. I imagine her drinking and her insistence on pursuing an art career, even though she wasn\u2019t talented, frightened the old novelist.\nSLAZINGER WAS NO prize himself, of course.\nAFTER THE PRISON break, I told the GRIOT\u2122 here all I knew about Pamela, and asked it to guess what might become of her after her breakup with Paul Slazinger. GRIOT\u2122 had her die of cirrhosis of the liver. I gave the machine the same set of facts a second time, and it had her freezing to death in a doorway in Chicago.\nThe prognosis was not good.\nAFTER LEAVING PAMELA, whose basic problem wasn\u2019t me but alcohol, I started to climb Musket Mountain, intending to think things out under the water tower. But I was met by Zuzu Jack-son, who was coming down. She said she had been under the water tower for hours, trying to think up dreams to replace those we had had of running off to Venice.\nShe said that maybe she would run off to Venice alone, and take Polaroid pictures of tourists getting in and out of gondolas.\nThe prognosis for her was a lot better than for Pamela, short-term anyway. At least she wasn\u2019t an addict, and at least she wasn\u2019t all alone in the world, even if all she had was Tex.

our time, Dr. Gorman Tarbell.\nThe assets I brought to the Pine Institute were general, chiefly the skills that go with a doctor\u2019s degree in business administration. I might as easily have applied these assets to running a tricycle factory or an amusement park. I was not in any way the creator of the theories that brought us to and through Armageddon. I arrived on the scene quite late, when much of the important thinking had been done.\nSpiritually, and in terms of sacrifice, the name of Dr. Tarbell should head the list of real contributors to the campaign and victory.\nChronologically, the list should probably begin with the late Dr. Selig Schildknecht, of Dresden, Germany, who spent, by and large fruitlessly, the last half of his life and inheritance in trying to get someone to pay attention to his theories on mental illness. What Schildknecht said, in effect, was that the only unified theory of mental illness that seemed to fit all the facts was the most ancient one, which had never been disproved. He believed that the mentally ill were possessed by the Devil.\nHe said so in book after book, all printed at his own expense, since no publisher would touch them, and he urged that research be undertaken to find out as much as possible about the Devil, his forms, his habits, his strong points, his weaknesses.\nNext on the list is an American, my former employer, Jessie L. Pine of Verdigris. Many years ago, Pine, an oil millionaire, ordered 200 feet of books for his library. The book dealer saw an opportunity to get rid of, among other gems, the collected works of Dr. Selig Schildknecht. Pine assumed that the Schildknecht volumes, since they were in a foreign language, contained passages too hot to be printed in English. So he hired the head of the University of Oklahoma\u2019s German Department to read them to him.\nFar from being infuriated by the book dealer\u2019s selection, Pine was overjoyed. All his life he\u2019d felt humiliated by his lack of education, and here he\u2019d found a man with five university degrees whose fundamental philosophy agreed with his own, to wit: \u201cOnliest thing in the world that\u2019s wrong with folks is that the Devil\u2019s got aholt of some of \u2019em.\u201d\nIf Schildknecht had managed to hold on to life a little longer, he wouldn\u2019t have died penniless. As it was, he missed the founding of the Jessie L. Pine Institute by only two years. From the moment of that founding on, every spurt from half the oil wells in Oklahoma was a nail in the Devil\u2019s coffin. And it was a slow day, indeed, when an opportunist of one sort or another didn\u2019t board a train for the marble halls rising in Verdigris.\nThe list, if I were to continue it, would get rather long, for thousands of men and women, a few of them intelligent and honest, began to explore the paths of research indicated by Schildknecht, while Pine followed doggedly with haversacks of fresh currency. But most of these men and women were jealous, incompetent passengers on one of the greatest gravy trains in history. Their experiments, usually awfully expensive, were principally satires on the ignorance and credulity of their benefactor, Jessie L. Pine.\nNothing would have come of all the millions spent, and I, for one, would have drawn my amazing paycheck without trying to deserve it, if it hadn\u2019t been for the living martyr of Armageddon, Dr. Gorman Tarbell.", 0.10608076563958918], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
