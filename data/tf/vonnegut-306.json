The desk, big enough for a helicopter to land on, was a gift from the Cornell alumni, and a silver plate on one corner said so. Justification of the lavish gift was inlaid in precious woods on the desk top: the football scores run up by the Big Red during the past five seasons. The why and wherefore of this object, at least, would leave no questions in the minds of future archaeologists.\n\u201cFrom East and West the crashing echoes answering call,\u201d cried the young voices, and Doctor Roseberry found it extremely difficult to concentrate on the two documents before him: a memo from the dean of the School of Arts and Sciences, a quaint, antique man in a quaint, antique part of the university; and a five-year-old letter from a carping alumnus who objected to the deportment of the team when off the playing field. The memo from the dean said that a Mr. Ewing J. Halyard had arrived in town in order to show the university to the Shah of Bratpuhr, and, incidentally, to make up a seventeen-year-old credit deficiency in physical education. The memo asked that Doctor Roseberry assign one of his staff to the chore of giving Halyard the final physical-education tests the next morning.\n\u201cCornell victorious!\nThe champions of all!\u201d\ncame the voices.\nDoctor Roseberry was inclined to react ironically to the last line of the song. \u201cCertainly, victorious last year, four years afore that,\u201d he muttered in his pregnant solitude. But here was another year that might not look so hot inlaid in rosewood. \u201cTomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,\u201d he said wearily.

She asks that I give the State of Indiana a copy of my latest novel, Deadeye Dick. I have complied with this request.\nSince books are to libraries what asphalt is to highway departments, I assume that Indiana is also asking donations from suppliers of asphalt for her roads. Or has it been decided that asphalt is worth good money, and that books are not?\nIt may be that whoever told Linda Walton to write that letter supposed that I myself get all the books I want for free. I in fact must pay for them what bookstores pay. So what I have sent you represents an actual outlay of about $7.00, plus postage and the price of a bookbag, plus a fair amount of my time, which may indeed be worthless. Let us forget the time. Are all of Indiana\u2019s suppliers of goods making equivalent sacrifices? Or are they to be more respected than I am for the way they make their livings? Are they more manly, more practical, less decorative?\nIf you have a cost accountant, he can easily prove to you that Ms. Walton\u2019s letter to me cost far more than one copy of Deadeye Dick.
