more about Dresden until I was asked by Franklin Library in 1976 to write a special introduction to a deluxe edition they were bringing out of my novel, Slaughterhouse-Five.\nI said this:\nThis is a book about something that happened to me a long time ago (1944)\u2014and the book itself is now something else that happened to me a long time ago (1969).\nTime marches on\u2014and the key event in this book, which is the fire-bombing of Dresden, is now a fossilized memory, sinking ever deeper into the tar pit of history. If American school children have heard of it at all, they are surely in doubt as to whether it happened in World War One or Two. Nor do I think they should care much.\nI, for one, am not avid to keep the memory of the fire-bombing fresh. I would of course be charmed if people continued to read this book for years to come, but not because I think there are important lessons to be learned from the Dresden catastrophe. I myself was in the midst of it, and learned only that people can become so enraged in war that they will burn great cities to the ground, and slay the inhabitants thereof.\nThat was nothing new.\nI write this in October of 1976, and it so happens that only two nights ago I saw a screening of Marcel Ophul\u2019s new documentary on war crimes, \u201cThe Memory of Justice,\u201d which included movies, taken from the air, of the Dresden raid\u2014at night. The city appeared to boil, and I was down there somewhere.\nI was supposed to appear onstage afterwards, with some other people who had had intimate experiences with Nazi death camps and so on, and to contribute my notions as to the meaning of it all.\nAtrocities celebrate meaninglessness, surely. I was mute. I did not mount the stage. I went home.\nThe Dresden atrocity, tremendously expensive and meticulously planned, was so meaningless, finally, that only one person on the entire planet got any benefit from it. I am that person.

He was one of the leaders of the Yippie movement of the 1960s and was arrested and tried for conspiracy and inciting to riot as a result of his part in the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Police broke up the protests in a violent confrontation, and Hoffman was arrested, along with seven other leaders. In 1971 he published a book called Steal This Book, which gave advice on how to live without paying for anything. In 1973 he was arrested and charged with intent to sell cocaine and maintained that undercover police agents had entrapped him by planting suitcases of cocaine in his office. In the spring of \u201974 he skipped bail, had cosmetic surgery, and hid from authorities for several years. He gave himself up in 1980, was sentenced to a year in prison, but was released after four months. In one of his trials he quoted Thomas Paine, one of the leaders of the American Revolution: \u201cEvery age and generation must be as free to act for itself in all cases as the age and generations which preceded it.\u2026 Man has no property in man; neither has any generation a property in the generations which are to follow.\u201d\nDear Mr. Lefcourt:\nI am writing about your client, Mr. Abbie Hoffman.

\u201cWhat\u2019s the word for \u2018army\u2019? \u2026 How do I ask for the bathroom? \u2026 What\u2019s the word for \u2018sick\u2019? \u2026 \u2018well\u2019? \u2026 \u2018dish\u2019? \u2026 \u2018brother\u2019? \u2026 \u2018shoe\u2019?\u201d My phlegmatic instructors tired, and one handed me a pamphlet purporting to make German easy for the man in the foxhole.\n\u201cSome of the first pages are missing,\u201d the donor explained as I jumped from the truck before the burgomaster\u2019s stone farmhouse. \u201cUsed \u2019em for cigarette papers,\u201d he said.\nIt was early morning when I knocked at the burgomaster\u2019s door. I stood on the step like a bit player in the wings, with the one line I was to deliver banging around an otherwise empty head. The door swung open. \u201cDolmetscher,\u201d I said.\nThe burgomaster himself, old, thin, and nightshirted, ushered me into the first-floor bedroom that was to be mine. He pantomimed as well as spoke his welcome, and a sprinkling of \u201cDanke sch\u00f6n\u201d was adequate dolmetsching for the time being. I was prepared to throttle further discussion with \u201cIch weiss nicht, was soll es bedeuten, dass ich so traurig bin.\u201d This would have sent him padding off to bed, convinced that he had a fluent, albeit shot-full-of-Weltschmerz, Dolmetscher. The stratagem wasn\u2019t necessary. He left me alone to consolidate my resources.\nChief among these was the mutilated pamphlet. I examined each of its precious pages in turn, delighted by the simplicity of transposing English into German. With this booklet, all I had to do was run my finger down the left-hand column until I found the English phrase I wanted, and then rattle off the nonsense syllables printed opposite in the right-hand column. \u201cHow many grenade launchers have you?\u201d for instance, was Vee feel grenada vairfair habben zee? Impeccable German for \u201cWhere are your tank columns?\u201d proved to be nothing more troublesome than Vo zint eara pantzer shpitzen? I mouthed the phrases: \u201cWhere are your howitzers? How many machine guns have you? Surrender! Don\u2019t shoot! Where have you hidden your motorcycle? Hands up! What unit are you from?\u201d\nThe pamphlet came to an abrupt end, toppling my spirits from manic to depressive. The Pennsylvania Dutchman had smoked up all the rear-area pleasantries, the pamphlet\u2019s first half, leaving me with nothing to work with but the repartee of hand-to-hand fighting.\nAs I lay sleepless in bed, the one drama in which I could play took shape in my mind\u2026.\nDOLMETSCHER (to BURGOMASTER\u2019S DAUGHTER): I don\u2019t know what will become of me, I am so sad. (Embraces her.)\nBURGOMASTER\u2019S DAUGHTER (with yielding shyness): The air is cool, and it\u2019s getting dark, and the Rhine is flowing quietly.\n(DOLMETSCHER seizes BURGOMASTER\u2019S DAUGHTER, carries her bodily into his room.)", 0.11885346520763188], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
