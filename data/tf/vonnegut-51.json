And welcome to Lewis Benjamin Brague [Brague\u2019s new baby boy].\nI\u2019ve squandered all my time on short stories and scripts that haven\u2019t sold, for the most part. It was a gamble worth taking\u2014but, like most gambles, it didn\u2019t pay off. So I haven\u2019t got a book and I haven\u2019t got any money.\nWell, neither bitch is quite justified. I\u2019ve got a little money left, and I\u2019ve got a book going. It\u2019s going to be a good book, Harry. We\u2019re just all going to have to be patient.\nHe who travels fastest travels alone, and my wife is pregnant for the third time.\nThere\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll finish this book this year. I want to finish it very much, and I\u2019m busting to get at it and keep at it all day, every day. But I\u2019ve got to earn that freedom with short stories.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do now, and I think I\u2019ll make it. I\u2019ve got an office in downtown Osterville now, shared with a C.P.A.

He leapt out of his overstuffed leather chair. He stamped his feet. He flapped his arms.\nHe put his livid face directly over the patient. He snarled and barked things like this: \u201cWhen will you ever learn that nobody cares anything about you, you, you, you boring, insignificant piece of poop? Your whole problem is you think you matter! Get over that, or sashay your stuck-up butt the hell out of here!\u201d\n18\nA bum on a cot next to Trout\u2019s asked him what he was writing. It was the opening paragraph of \u201cDr. Schadenfreude.\u201d Trout said it was a story. The bum said maybe Trout could get some money from the people next door. When Trout heard it was the American Academy of Arts and Letters next door, he said, \u201cIt might as well be a Chinese barber college as far as I\u2019m concerned. I don\u2019t write literature. Literature is all those la-di-da monkeys next door care about.\n\u201cThose artsy-fartsy twerps next door create living, breathing, three-dimensional characters with ink on paper,\u201d he went on. \u201cWonderful! As though the planet weren\u2019t already dying because it has three billion too many living, breathing, three-dimensional characters!\u201d\nThe only people next door, actually, of course, were Monica and Zoltan Pepper, and the three-man day shift of armed guards, headed by Dudley Prince. Monica had given her office and janitorial staffs the day off for last-minute Christmas shopping. As it happened, they were all Christian or agnostic or apostate.\nThe night shift of armed guards would be entirely Muslim. As Trout would write at Xanadu, in My Ten Years on Automatic Pilot: \u201cMuslims do not believe in Santa Claus.\u201d\n\u201cIn my entire career as a writer,\u201d said Trout in the former Museum of the American Indian, \u201cI created only one living, breathing, three-dimensional character. I did it with my ding-dong in a birth canal. Ting-a-ling!\u201d He was referring to his son Leon, the deserter from the United States Marines in time of war, subsequently decapitated in a Swedish shipyard.\n\u201cIf I\u2019d wasted my time creating characters,\u201d Trout said, \u201cI would never have gotten around to calling attention to things that really matter: irresistible forces in nature, and cruel inventions, and cockamamie ideals and governments and economies that make heroes and heroines alike feel like something the cat drug in.\u201d\nTrout might have said, and it can be said of me as well, that he created caricatures rather than characters. His animus against so-called mainstream literature, moreover, wasn\u2019t peculiar to him.

She was amazed by the answer, wanted to protest that it couldn\u2019t possibly be hers. \"Pointless,\" she\u2019d said.\nMoments later, she asked the woman thickly, \"What was in that needle?\"\n\"What was in the needle, honey bunch?

And Hitler turned into a baby, Billy Pilgrim supposed. That wasn\u2019t in the movie. Billy was extrapolating. Everybody turned into a baby, and all humanity, without exception, conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve, he supposed.\nBilly saw the war movies backwards then forwards\u2014and then it was time to go out into his backyard to meet the flying saucer. Out he went, his blue and ivory feet crushing the wet salad of the lawn. He stopped, took a swig of the dead champagne. It was like 7-Up. He would not raise his eyes to the sky, though he knew there was a flying saucer from Tralfamadore up there. He would see it soon enough, inside and out, and he would see, too, where it came from soon enough\u2014soon enough.\nOverhead he heard the cry of what might have been a melodious owl, but it wasn\u2019t a melodious owl. It was a flying saucer from Tralfamadore, navigating in both space and time, therefore seeming to Billy Pilgrim to have come from nowhere all at once. Somewhere a big dog barked.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe saucer was one hundred feet in diameter, with portholes around its rim. The light from the portholes was a pulsing purple. The only noise it made was the owl song. It came down to hover over Billy, and to enclose him in a cylinder of pulsing purple light. Now there was the sound of a seeming kiss as an airtight hatch in the bottom of the saucer was opened. Down snaked a ladder that was outlined in pretty lights like a Ferris wheel.\nBilly\u2019s will was paralyzed by a zap gun aimed at him from one of the portholes. It became imperative that he take hold of the bottom rung of the sinuous ladder, which he did. The rung was electrified, so that Billy\u2019s hands locked onto it hard. He was hauled into the airlock, and machinery closed the bottom door. Only then did the ladder, wound onto a reel in the airlock, let him go. Only then did Billy\u2019s brain start working again.\nThere were two peepholes inside the airlock\u2014with yellow eyes pressed to them. There was a speaker on the wall. The Tralfamadorians had no voice boxes. They communicated telepathically. They were able to talk to Billy by means of a computer and a sort of electric organ which made every Earthling speech sound.\n\u201cWelcome aboard, Mr. Pilgrim,\u201d said the loudspeaker. \u201cAny questions?\u201d\nBilly licked his lips, thought a while, inquired at last: \u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\u201cThat is a very Earthling question to ask, Mr. Pilgrim.

until it is hungry. It then waddles down to the ocean and swims slowly and not all that ably until it is a few meters from shore. Then it dives like a submarine, and stuffs itself with seaweed, which is at that time indigestible. The seaweed is going to have to be cooked before it is digestible.\nSo the marine iguana pops to the surface, swims ashore, and sits on the lava in the sunshine again. It is using itself for a covered stewpot, getting hotter and hotter while the sunshine cooks the seaweed. It continues to stare into the middle distance at nothing, as before, but with this difference: It now spits up increasingly hot saltwater from time to time.\nDuring the million years I have spent in these islands, the Law of Natural Selection has found no way to improve, or, for that matter, to worsen this particular survival scheme.\nKing knew that six persons had actually reached Guayaquil, and were in the Hotel El Dorado at that very moment, still expecting to take \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d This was a minor shock to him. He had assumed that those who had made their own arrangements to get there would surely stay away, since the news from the area was so bad.\nHe had the names of all six. One was entirely unknown to him, a Canadian named Willard Flemming. That was actually James Wait, of course. King could not imagine how this person had gotten onto the passenger list, which, with the exception of Mary Hepburn and a Japanese veterinarian and his wife, was supposed to be composed of newsmakers and trend-setters of the highest potency.\nIt puzzled King that Mary Hepburn was down there, but not her husband, Roy. He hadn\u2019t heard that Roy was dead. And he knew something about the Hepburns, even though they were complete nobodies on a passenger list of celebrities, because they were the very first persons to sign up for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d That was at a time when King had reason to doubt that any really famous person could be induced to make the trip.\nWhen the Hepburns signed on, in fact, King had played with the idea of turning them into mini-celebrities somehow, with appearances on talk shows and newspaper interviews and so on. He would never meet them, but he did talk to Mary on the telephone, hoping against hope that there might be something interesting about the Hepburns, even though they held the most ordinary sorts of jobs in a drab industrial town with the highest unemployment rate in the country. One or the other might have a famous ancestor or relative, or Roy might have been a hero in some war, or they might have won a lottery, or they might have suffered a recent tragedy, or whatever.\nAnd parts of King\u2019s conversation with Mary back in January had gone like this:\n\u201cWell\u2014I am a distant relative of Daniel Boone,\u201d she said. \u201cMy maiden name was Boone, and I was born in Kentucky.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d said King. \u201cYou\u2019re his great-great-great-granddaughter or what?\u201d", 0.06781045751633988], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["gregory", 0.03125], ["woman", 0.025], ["dan", 0.01875], ["marilee", 0.01875], ["photographs", 0.0125], ["art", 0.0125], ["people", 0.0125], ["hard", 0.0125], ["cars", 0.0125], ["pullman", 0.0125], ["station", 0.0125], ["pictures", 0.0125], ["darker", 0.0125], ["passenger", 0.0125], ["spot", 0.0125], ["time", 0.0125], ["flapper", 0.00625], ["madison", 0.00625], ["beauties", 0.00625], ["limited", 0.00625], ["josephine", 0.00625], ["years", 0.00625], ["course", 0.00625], ["hugged", 0.00625], ["cocky", 0.00625], ["skin", 0.00625], ["touch", 0.00625], ["darkest", 0.00625], ["hadn", 0.00625], ["thinking", 0.00625], ["photographer", 0.00625], ["sentence", 0.00625], ["father", 0.00625], ["young", 0.00625], ["realize", 0.00625], ["platform", 0.00625], ["tail", 0.00625], ["going", 0.00625], ["easy", 0.00625], ["whiter", 0.00625], ["women", 0.00625], ["read", 0.00625], ["massacre", 0.00625], ["posed", 0.00625], ["seemingly", 0.00625], ["bound", 0.00625], ["minded", 0.00625], ["excluded", 0.00625], ["killed", 0.00625], ["easily", 0.00625], ["gifted", 0.00625], ["theaters", 0.00625], ["scott", 0.00625], ["restaurants", 0.00625], ["snapshots", 0.00625], ["hair", 0.00625], ["gorillas", 0.00625], ["substitute", 0.00625], ["closer", 0.00625], ["confirm", 0.00625], ["god", 0.00625], ["pioneer", 0.00625], ["chimpanzees", 0.00625], ["berman", 0.00625], ["illustrations", 0.00625], ["toenails", 0.00625], ["flashbulb", 0.00625], ["commercial", 0.00625], ["story", 0.00625], ["refused", 0.00625], ["twentieth", 0.00625], ["costumed", 0.00625], ["golly", 0.00625], ["central", 0.00625], ["days", 0.00625], ["finest", 0.00625], ["letters", 0.00625], ["character", 0.00625], ["number", 0.00625], ["empress", 0.00625], ["long", 0.00625], ["artists", 0.00625], ["illustrating", 0.00625], ["ring", 0.00625], ["hotels", 0.00625], ["fire", 0.00625], ["guess", 0.00625], ["remains", 0.00625], ["caught", 0.00625], ["funnily", 0.00625], ["custom", 0.00625], ["lot", 0.00625], ["leeringly", 0.00625], ["mermaid", 0.00625], ["circe", 0.00625], ["eyes", 0.00625], ["champion", 0.00625], ["successful", 0.00625], ["train", 0.00625], ["dead", 0.00625], ["apprentice", 0.00625], ["polly", 0.00625], ["glamorous", 0.00625], ["locked", 0.00625], ["lecherous", 0.00625], ["skull", 0.00625], ["inside", 0.00625], ["work", 0.00625], ["weren", 0.00625], ["hoping", 0.00625], ["century", 0.00625], ["portraits", 0.00625], ["mind", 0.00625], ["middle", 0.00625], ["wonderful", 0.00625], ["kissed", 0.00625], ["looked", 0.00625], ["afraid", 0.00625], ["began", 0.00625], ["cave", 0.00625], ["fitzgerald", 0.00625], ["equipment", 0.00625], ["recognition", 0.00625], ["copying", 0.00625], ["grand", 0.00625], ["typewriter", 0.00625], ["poor", 0.00625], ["camera", 0.00625], ["mother", 0.00625], ["kid", 0.00625], ["succeeded", 0.00625], ["wife", 0.00625], ["greet", 0.00625], ["thought", 0.00625], ["races", 0.00625], ["doubted", 0.00625], ["left", 0.00625]], "sentiment": ["So when I became an apprentice to Dan Gregory, I was going into the ring with the world\u2019s champion of commercial art. His illustrations must have made any number of gifted young artists give up on art, thinking, \u201cMy God, I could never do anything that wonderful.\u201d\nI was a really cocky kid, I now realize. From the very first, when I began copying Gregory, I was saying to myself, in effect, \u201cIf I work hard enough, by golly, I can do that, too!\u201d\nSo there I was in Grand Central Station, with everybody but me being hugged and kissed by everybody, seemingly. I had doubted that Dan Gregory would come to greet me, but where was Marilee?\nDid she know what I looked like? Of course. I had sent her many self-portraits, and snapshots taken by my mother, too.\nFather, by the way, refused to touch a camera, saying that all it caught was dead skin and toenails and hair which people long gone had left behind. I guess he thought photographs were a poor substitute for all the people killed in the massacre.\nEven if Marilee hadn\u2019t seen those pictures of me, I would have been easy to spot, since I was the darkest passenger by far on any of the Pullman cars. Any passenger much darker than me in those days would have been excluded by custom from Pullman cars\u2014and almost all hotels and theaters and restaurants.\nWas I sure I could spot Marilee at the station? Funnily enough: no. She had sent me nine photographs over the years, which are now bound together with her letters. They were made with the finest equipment by Dan Gregory himself, who could easily have become a successful photographer. But Gregory had also costumed and posed her each time as a character in some story he was illustrating\u2014the Empress Josephine, an F. Scott Fitzgerald flapper, a cave woman, a pioneer wife, a mermaid, tail and all, and so on. It was and remains hard to believe that these weren\u2019t pictures of nine different women.\nThere were many beauties on the platform, since the Twentieth Century Limited was the most glamorous train of its time. So I locked eyes with woman after woman, hoping to fire the flashbulb of recognition inside her skull. But all I succeeded in doing, I am afraid, was to confirm for each woman that the darker races were indeed leeringly lecherous, being closer than the whiter ones to the gorillas, the chimpanzees.\nPolly Madison, a.k.a.

I paint or draw pictures, and Joe makes prints of some of them, one by one, color by color, by means of the time-consuming, archaic silk screen process, practiced by almost nobody else any more: squeegeeing inks through cloths and onto paper. This process is so painstaking and tactile, almost balletic, that each print Joe makes is a painting in its own right.\nOur partnership\u2019s name, Origami Express, is my tribute to the many-layered packages Joe makes for prints he sends for me to sign and number. The logo for Origami, made by Joe, isn\u2019t his picture of a picture I sent him, but of a picture by me that he found in my novel Breakfast of Champions.

But readers insist on the very same thing. They want our pages to look very much like pages they have seen before.\nWhy? It is because they themselves have a tough job to do, and they need all the help they can get from us. They have to identify thousands of little marks on paper, and make sense of them immediately. They have to read, an art so difficult that most people do not really master it even after having studied it all through grade school and high school\u2014for twelve long years.\nSo this discussion, like all discussions of literary styles, must finally acknowledge that our stylistic options as writers are neither numerous nor glamorous, since our readers are bound to be such imperfect artists. Our audience requires us to be sympathetic and patient teachers, ever willing to simplify and clarify\u2014whereas we would rather soar high above the crowd, singing like nightingales.\nThat is the bad news. The good news is that we Americans are governed under a unique Constitution, which allows us to write whatever we please without fear of punishment. So the most meaningful aspect of our styles, which is what we choose to write about, is unlimited.\nAlso: we are members of an egalitarian society, so there is no reason for us to write, in case we are not classically educated aristocrats, as though we were classically educated aristocrats.\nFor a discussion of literary style in a narrower sense, in a more technical sense, I commend to your attention The Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr., and E. B. White (Macmillan, 1979). It contains such rules as this: \u201cA participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject,\u201d and so on. E. B. White is, of course, one of the most admirable literary stylists this country has so far produced.\nYou should realize, too, that no one would care how well or badly Mr. White expressed himself, if he did not have perfectly enchanting things to say.\n5\nSELF-INTERVIEW\nTHIS SELF-INTERVIEW FROM The Paris Review No. 69, 1977, appears here with the permission of The Viking Press, which gets out collections of Paris Review interviews and owns the copyrights to all of them.", 0.09581978319783199], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["charley", 0.10416666666666667], ["ned", 0.08333333333333333], ["robert", 0.041666666666666664], ["going", 0.041666666666666664], ["looked", 0.041666666666666664], ["nancy", 0.041666666666666664], ["managed", 0.020833333333333332], ["lightly", 0.020833333333333332], ["prosit", 0.020833333333333332], ["mind", 0.020833333333333332], ["argument", 0.020833333333333332], ["crosby", 0.020833333333333332], ["ready", 0.020833333333333332], ["table", 0.020833333333333332], ["ease", 0.020833333333333332], ["stood", 0.020833333333333332], ["skoal", 0.020833333333333332], ["mud", 0.020833333333333332], ["unable", 0.020833333333333332], ["crying", 0.020833333333333332], ["smile", 0.020833333333333332], ["friend", 0.020833333333333332], ["wheedle", 0.020833333333333332], ["eye", 0.020833333333333332], ["drink", 0.020833333333333332], ["innkeeper", 0.020833333333333332], ["glamour", 0.020833333333333332], ["wrong", 0.020833333333333332], ["plan", 0.020833333333333332], ["bar", 0.020833333333333332], ["sound", 0.020833333333333332], ["sighed", 0.020833333333333332], ["radiant", 0.020833333333333332], ["amused", 0.020833333333333332], ["hope", 0.020833333333333332], ["time", 0.020833333333333332], ["affection", 0.020833333333333332]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYou sound that way,\u201d said Nancy. \u201cWhat did I say wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2014nothing to do with you,\u201d said Robert.

I said.\n\u201cThem was the last words of Caryl Chessman,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess they\u2019ll be your last words, too.\u201d\nCaryl Chessman was a convicted kidnapper and rapist, but not a murderer, who spent twelve years on death row in California. He made all his own appeals for stays of execution, and he learned four languages and wrote two bestselling books before he was put into an airtight tank with windows in it, and made to breathe cyanide gas.\nAnd his last words were indeed, as Clyde said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\u201cWell now, listen,\u201d said Clyde. \u201cWhen you get yourself a bartending job up there in New York, I just know you\u2019re going to wind up owning that bar inside of two years\u2019 time.\u201d This was kindness on his part, and not genuine optimism. Clyde was trying to help me be brave. \u201cAnd after you\u2019ve got the most popular bar in New York,\u201d he went on, \u201cI just hope you\u2019ll remember Clyde and maybe send for him.

By that time I\u2019ll be able to fix your locks, too.\u201d\nI knew he had been considering enrolling in The Illinois Institute of Instruction course in locksmithing.

Clyde and I were crossing the vast parade ground at its center. I with my bedding in my arms. This was where young infantrymen, the glory of their nation, had performed at one time, demonstrating their eagerness to do or die. Now I, too, I thought, had served my country in uniform, had at every moment for two years done precisely what my country had asked me to do. It had asked me to suffer. It had not asked me to die.\nThere were faces at some of the windows\u2014feeble old felons with bad hearts, bad lungs, bad livers, what have you. But there was only one other figure on the parade ground itself. He was dragging a large canvas trash bag after himself as he picked up papers with a spike at the end of a long stick. He was small and old, like me. When he saw us coming, he positioned himself between us and the Administration Building, and he pointed his spike at me, indicating that he had something very important to say to me.

I dunno.

He looked over his shoulder, perceived that they were being followed by a white Oldsmobile Toronado with a black vinyl roof. This four hundred horsepower, front-wheel drive vehicle was burbling along at about three miles an hour, ten feet behind them and close to the curb.\nThat was the last thing Trout remembered\u2014seeing the Oldsmobile back there.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe next thing he knew, he was on his hands and knees on a handball court underneath the Queensboro Bridge at Fifty-ninth Street, with the East River nearby. His trousers and underpants were around his ankles. His money was gone. His parcels were scattered around him\u2014the tuxedo, the new shirt, the books. Blood seeped from one ear.\nThe police caught him in the act of pulling up his trousers. They dazzled him with a spotlight as he leaned against the backboard of the handball court and fumbled foolishly with his belt and the buttons on his fly. The police supposed that they had caught him committing some public nuisance, had caught him working with an old man\u2019s limited palette of excrement and alcohol.\nHe wasn\u2019t quite penniless. There was a ten-dollar bill in the watch pocket of his pants.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was determined at a hospital that Trout was not seriously hurt. He was taken to a police station, where he was questioned. All he could say was that he had been kidnapped by pure evil in a white Oldsmobile. The police wanted to know how many people were in the car, their ages, their sexes, the colors of their skins, their manners of speech.\n\u201cFor all I know, they may not even have been Earthlings,\u201d said Trout. \u201cFor all I know, that car may have been occupied by an intelligent gas from Pluto.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.05995670995670996], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["kleinhans", 0.03508771929824561], ["kniptash", 0.03508771929824561], ["crayons", 0.02631578947368421], ["eggs", 0.02631578947368421], ["talk", 0.02631578947368421], ["ears", 0.017543859649122806], ["coleman", 0.017543859649122806], ["cellar", 0.017543859649122806], ["butter", 0.017543859649122806], ["green", 0.017543859649122806], ["basement", 0.008771929824561403], ["bombed", 0.008771929824561403], ["yellow", 0.008771929824561403], ["crayon", 0.008771929824561403], ["flavor", 0.008771929824561403], ["ground", 0.008771929824561403], ["grape", 0.008771929824561403], ["writing", 0.008771929824561403], ["orange", 0.008771929824561403], ["jars", 0.008771929824561403], ["sitting", 0.008771929824561403], ["food", 0.008771929824561403], ["lunch", 0.008771929824561403], ["hands", 0.008771929824561403], ["experimentally", 0.008771929824561403], ["day", 0.008771929824561403], ["morning", 0.008771929824561403], ["skyline", 0.008771929824561403], ["rock", 0.008771929824561403], ["rack", 0.008771929824561403], ["set", 0.008771929824561403], ["begged", 0.008771929824561403], ["house", 0.008771929824561403], ["sneaked", 0.008771929824561403], ["railed", 0.008771929824561403], ["taunted", 0.008771929824561403], ["purple", 0.008771929824561403], ["noon", 0.008771929824561403], ["mason", 0.008771929824561403], ["laid", 0.008771929824561403], ["emerged", 0.008771929824561403], ["hopefully", 0.008771929824561403], ["marching", 0.008771929824561403], ["full", 0.008771929824561403], ["dresden", 0.008771929824561403], ["refused", 0.008771929824561403], ["step", 0.008771929824561403], ["staring", 0.008771929824561403], ["ahead", 0.008771929824561403], ["terrible", 0.008771929824561403], ["pockets", 0.008771929824561403], ["asked", 0.008771929824561403], ["wads", 0.008771929824561403], ["snug", 0.008771929824561403], ["thoughtfully", 0.008771929824561403], ["splintered", 0.008771929824561403], ["three", 0.008771929824561403], ["wonderful", 0.008771929824561403], ["stuffed", 0.008771929824561403], ["white", 0.008771929824561403], ["threw", 0.008771929824561403], ["dispirited", 0.008771929824561403], ["spit", 0.008771929824561403], ["boys", 0.008771929824561403], ["ha", 0.008771929824561403], ["pouch", 0.008771929824561403], ["women", 0.008771929824561403], ["keeping", 0.008771929824561403], ["hour", 0.008771929824561403], ["strawberry", 0.008771929824561403], ["dirty", 0.008771929824561403], ["listen", 0.008771929824561403], ["temper", 0.008771929824561403], ["hoping", 0.008771929824561403], ["gnawing", 0.008771929824561403], ["days", 0.008771929824561403], ["ii", 0.008771929824561403], ["protruded", 0.008771929824561403], ["cotton", 0.008771929824561403], ["pink", 0.008771929824561403], ["lemon", 0.008771929824561403], ["detail", 0.008771929824561403], ["triumphantly", 0.008771929824561403], ["cartridge", 0.008771929824561403], ["knew", 0.008771929824561403], ["hand", 0.008771929824561403], ["notebook", 0.008771929824561403], ["plenty", 0.008771929824561403], ["pleaded", 0.008771929824561403], ["thoughts", 0.008771929824561403], ["tufts", 0.008771929824561403], ["charges", 0.008771929824561403], ["wards", 0.008771929824561403], ["punishment", 0.008771929824561403], ["relief", 0.008771929824561403], ["pulled", 0.008771929824561403], ["left", 0.008771929824561403]], "sentiment": ["\u201cAnd then what\u2019d she do?\u201d said Kniptash.
