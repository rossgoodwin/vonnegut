Typical. I wonder now how on Earth I could have done what they say I\u2019ve done, and am reminded of Tony Costa, a murderer of perhaps twenty women, about whom I did a story for Life magazine so long ago. We corresponded some after he was put away with the Boston Strangler in Bridgewater State Prison in Massachusetts. He said a person like him couldn\u2019t possibly have done what people said he\u2019d done.\nI am reminded, too, of what Samuel Johnson said about Gulliver\u2019s Travels: \u201cOnce you\u2019d thought of the little people, the rest was obvious.\u201d Once I survived the firebombing of the Florence of the Elbe as a captured PFC, maybe the rest was obvious.\nAnd, on my Word of Honor, you were my mentor when we were very young. I\u2019ve said that before, but maybe you didn\u2019t hear me. And I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re still O.K. Me, too. Damned if we didn\u2019t survive the Second Battle of the Somme.\nCheers and love as always\u2014\nKurt\nAugust 7, 1999\nSagaponack, NY\nTO DON FARBER", 0.11398148148148149], "title": "Letters"}}
