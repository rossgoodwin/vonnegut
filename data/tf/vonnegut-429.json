NOTE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nKurt\u2019s letters, which he wrote on the typewriter (he was proud of being a Luddite who never switched to computers) sometimes contained spelling errors that he didn\u2019t bother to correct, and I have silently made those corrections for smoother reading. I have also silently corrected punctuation errors. A few of Kurt\u2019s later letters were written all in caps, though the content didn\u2019t indicate any need for such an emphasis, and I have put them in upper/lower case. (As an old typewriter user, my guess is that the key was already locked on caps and he didn\u2019t bother to change it.) I have also removed underlinings, which were often added by hand in the earlier years. In some instances I have removed passages of certain letters\u2014most often to avoid repetition, or to leave out commonplace details such as telephone numbers or lines that the passage of time has made irrelevant or obscure. These deletions are marked with an ellipsis between brackets. In most instances I have removed addresses, except when it seemed the address would be of interest. I have sometimes had to infer the place Kurt was writing from when the letter didn\u2019t make it clear and he did not include a return address. In such cases the presumed location is marked within brackets.\nThanks first of all to my longtime friend Mark Vonnegut and my newfound friend Don Farber for making this book possible. Thanks to Don, Mark, and Kurt\u2019s daughters Edith and Nanette Vonnegut for generously providing letters for this book.\nMy thanks to the many friends of Kurt who shared not only letters but also valuable information based on their friendship with him. These gracious and generous friends include Mary Jane \u201cMajie\u201d Failey, who was a friend of his from childhood throughout his life; Victor Jose, another lifelong friend, from the time they were members of the Owls Club at Shortridge High School to the Chicago News Bureau as fellow journalists after returning home from the Army after World War II and on many of Kurt\u2019s trips home to Indianapolis; and Sidney Offit and Dr. Robert Maslansky, Kurt\u2019s good friends in New York. S. Miller Harris, his valued friend and mentor from their days on The Cornell Sun and throughout his life, has been a great mine of information for me and generous in providing it. At ninety, he is my role model and hero, still working and loving what he does. I found him on Facebook.\nThe first and perhaps most perceptive critic of Vonnegut\u2019s work was Robert Scholes, whose book The Fabulators gave the earliest appraisal of Vonnegut\u2019s writing. A research professor at Brown University in the department of modern culture and media, his many articles and books include, recently, The Rise and Fall of English. He became a friend of Vonnegut\u2019s and gave me important letters and information.\nProfessor Jerome Klinkowitz of the University of Northern Iowa was one of the early academic advocates of Vonnegut\u2019s work and an important friend, whom I met because of Kurt\u2019s introduction in 1972. He has been an invaluable resource in my work on this book and through his critical books on Vonnegut, most recently Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s America. Jerry and Julie Klinkowitz supplied invaluable research and support throughout this project.\nThanks to Charles Shields for generously sharing letters and background information.", 0.1869033189033189], "title": "Letters"}}
