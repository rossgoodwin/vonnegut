I have written you twice so far\u2014in care of Jill\u2019s brother in Paris and in care of American Express in Athens. In each case I enclosed an application for an American Express card, which must be signed by you. There is a ten-dollar bill for walking-around money in the one to Athens. I will keep trying.\nJane and I read your letters to each other over the telephone. We celebrate you. We find nothing to complain of. You are doing what my father and grandfather did when they were your age, what used to be a conventional thing for middle class people aspiring to lives of cultivation to do: You are making le grand tour. Father and Grandfather both sketched, and, as you know, became architects. When they got home, they could lift all sorts of design details from their sketches.\nI enclose yet another American Express application. All you have to do is to sign your name where I have placed a red X, and then return the form to me airmail. You might also tell me where I should send the card when I get it. It should be a place where you will pick up the card not just maybe, but without fail.\nMy book, \u201cMary Kathleen O\u2019Looney,\u201d is progressing nicely at last. It might be finished by the first of next year, which would make me as merry as a bird. Finishing at last will be like having a curse or a tumor removed. After that, I may really feel like tooling off to Rome to see you, or whatever.\nEverybody in the family, so far as I know, is in booming health. I have been waiting to hear the first jokes about the Polish Pope. This evening I heard my first three. (1.) His first miracle was to make a blind man lame. (2.) His first official act was to pardon Roman Polanski. (3.)

Cleveland, he learned, had bought a lot of cheap pipe from another company, and Cleveland was going to be sorry about it in about twenty years. The Navy had specified Creon pipe for all buildings under construction, he learned, and nobody was going to be sorry. It was a little-known fact, he learned, that the whole world stood in awe of American pipe-making capabilities.\nHe also found out who the woman on the first tee was. She had been brought to the dance by Arvin Borders, bachelor manager of the Creon Works. Borders had met her in New York. She was a small-time actress, the widow of a jazz musician, the mother of two very young daughters.\nAndy found out all this from the bartender. Arvin Borders, \u201cMr. Pipe\u201d himself, came into the bar and craned his neck, looking for somebody. He was carrying two highballs. The ice in both glasses had melted.\n\u201cStill haven\u2019t seen her, Mr. Borders,\u201d the bartender called to him, and Borders nodded unhappily and left.\n\u201cWho haven\u2019t you seen?\u201d Andy asked the bartender.\nAnd the bartender told him all he knew about the widow. He also gave Andy the opinion, out of the corner of his mouth, that General Forge and Foundry Company headquarters in Ilium, New York, knew about the romance and took a very dim view of it. \u201cYou tell me where, in all of Creon,\u201d the bartender said to Andy, \u201ca pretty, young New York actress could fit in.\u201d\nThe woman went by her stage name, which was Hildy Matthews, Andy learned. The bartender didn\u2019t have any idea who her husband had been.\nAndy went into the ballroom to tell his Pipe-Dreamers to play a little better for a weeping lady on the golf course, and he found Arvin Borders talking to them.
