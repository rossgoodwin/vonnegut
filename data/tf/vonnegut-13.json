\u201cKay\u201d to distinguish him from his father, Kurt, Sr.) from Camp Atterbury, outside Indianapolis, when Vonnegut returned home from his service with the U.S. Army during WWII. Uncle Alex had taken Kurt\u2019s older sister, Alice, with him on the trip.\nDear Ella:\nKay is home. At lunch yesterday noon Kurt told me that Alice had telephoned to her. Kay had called from Camp Atterbury. Would they please call for him at about 3 o\u2019clock; he felt certain that he would be able to get away at that time. I was pleased that Kurt asked me to go with him and Alice to get the boy. It was the first time I had been at Atterbury. What an immense place: barracks, barracks stretching over many square miles and thousands of soldiers and many German Prisoners of War. We went to the Officers\u2019 Club No. 1, where Kay had told us to meet him. It was ten minutes after three, but no Kay anywhere in sight. Juke boxes playing and soldiers and Wacs dancing. A busy ice-cream stand, with pies and Coca-Cola also available. Alice was nervous. She feared she might vomit. We got Coca-Colas and sat on the front porch. A dozen soldiers sitting around passing the time away. The general atmosphere was boredom.\nIn the distance we saw a tall lad approaching, carrying a big heavy bag. Could it be Kay? Those long legs. It might be; it was! We let Alice go to meet him. A hug and a kiss. \u201cNow, no emotions, please!\u201d Kay pleaded. They both wiped their eyes. A hug from his father. A formal handshake from me. The big bag was picked up and carried to Kurt\u2019s Dodge car. Kay opened the back of the car and threw the heavy bag in. He is tall as ever, the same long eyelashes but, oh, that face! Well browned from the recuperation center at Le Havre and the fifteen-day trip across the Atlantic.\n\u201cI want to drive the car!\u201d He drove us home. I wish I could have taken down in shorthand or, better yet, I wish I could have had a dictaphone to record what that lad of twenty-two years (he\u2019ll be 23 in November\u2014November 11th) told us. He speaks well. He is articulate. And he spoke continuously from Atterbury to Indianapolis. But what did he say? What didn\u2019t he say! What hasn\u2019t he seen? What hasn\u2019t he endured and suffered.\nNothing that I can write here will give an adequate impression of what we heard. Mind you, he was driving and talking, and it\u2019s only some forty-odd miles from Atterbury to Louise Adams\u2019 house where Jimbo had been parked for the afternoon. As a result of his experiences after being taken prisoner on that ghastly day when the 106th Division was suddenly and quite unexpectedly overwhelmed, he lost forty-five pounds. \u201cI had never been really hungry before. I did not know what it means to be thirsty. To be really hungry is a strange sensation. You go nuts! But you mustn\u2019t give up. If you give up\u2014if you don\u2019t care, if you lie down and don\u2019t care, your kidneys go bad and you piss blood, and then you can\u2019t get up again and you just wilt away.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do they say over here about the bombing of Dresden?\u201d Yes, we told him that we knew that Dresden had been bombed. He saw Dresden before it all happened\u2014in 24 hours! He was in the midst of it\u2014confined with 150 Prisoners in the Municipal Slaughter House, which was not bombed. \u201cAs one guy said, \u2018Well, there were one hundred and fifty pigs here, and now 150 Infantry Prisoners.\u2019 Now you lie down in any part of Dresden and see all over the area that once was that beautiful, beautiful city. Hardly fifty houses standing in the vast area. And don\u2019t think it was not an outrage to destroy that city! You can\u2019t imagine what it means. And who was killed? Two hundred fifty thousand men\u2014mostly older men, of course\u2014and all the women and all the children. You cannot describe what it means to be bombed. And think of it!

American industry, the railroads, was waiting for me at the far end of the blue tunnel. We hadn\u2019t met before. This great American died in 1926 at the age of seventy-one when I was only four years old.\nI thanked him for words of his, which I quote again and again in lectures: \u201cAs long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I am of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\u201d\nHe asked me how those words were received here on Earth in America nowadays. I said they were ridiculed. \u201cPeople snicker and snort,\u201d I said. He asked what our fastest growing industry was. \u201cThe building of prisons,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat a shame,\u201d he said. And then he asked me how the Sermon on the Mount was going over these days. And then he spread his wings and flew away.\nthis is kurt vonnegut.\nDuring my controlled near-death experience this morning, I had a continental breakfast with Harold Epstein, who died recently on his one-and-a-half-acre estate in Larchmont. He died of what can only be called natural causes, since he was ninety-four. This sweet man was a certified public accountant who, after a heart attack thirty-four years ago, surrendered in the company of his sweet wife Esta to what he himself called \u201cGarden Insanity.\u201d\nEsta is still among us, and I hope she\u2019s listening. These two love birds, Harold and Esta Epstein, traveled around the world four times, seeking, and often finding, wonderful new plants for American gardens, although neither one of them had any formal training as a horticulturist. At the time Harold\u2019s soul traded his old flesh for new flesh in Heaven, he was president emeritus of the American Rock Garden Society, the Greater New York Orchid Society, and the Northeast Region of the American Rhododendron Society.\nI asked him for a WNYC sound bite I could use in summing up his life after his heart attack so long ago. He said, \u201cMy only regret is that everybody couldn\u2019t be as happy as we were.\u201d The late Harold Epstein said that the first thing he did after he got to Heaven, after picking a flower he\u2019d never seen before, was to thank God for the priceless gift of garden insanity.\njack kevorkian and i thought\nwe knew all the risks I was taking during the controlled near-death experiences he has been giving me.

He was, the General had said, to help with the haying.\nHe turned over, pulled the sheet over his head, and closed his eyes. Haley dreamed of saying good night to his mother and father, of wishing them, handsome and young in evening clothes, a pleasant time at their party. He dreamed of the friends who had come to get him the next morning, to tell him that he must stay with them for a little while, that there had been an automobile accident, that he mustn\u2019t cry, that he must be a man. . . . He had cried.\nIII.\nHaley was awakened the next morning by a banging on his door, a shout by his ear, and the shock of a cold washcloth on his face. He sat upright and saw the General standing at the foot of the cot, squat, fat, and laughing. A towel was knotted about the man\u2019s abdomen; with another he was rubbing his bare chest to a glowing pink. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the music business, boy; you\u2019re a farmer now. Take a cold shower, and be down for breakfast in ten minutes, or you don\u2019t eat,\u201d he trumpeted.\n\u201cYessir,\u201d said Haley. Ten minutes later he was seated, puffing and shivering, at the long kitchen table, ducking his head now and then to avoid the flying elbows of Annie, who was energetically making flapjacks on the range behind him. The hot water faucet in the shower stall had been a cruel fraud, he reflected resentfully. The glare from the naked bulb that hung over the table hurt his eyes. He looked away from it to the blackness outside the windows and realized with sleepy awe that he would be seeing a sunrise for the first time in his life. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, after waiting fruitlessly for someone\u2014Annie, Hope, or the General\u2014to acknowledge his presence.\nThe General and Hope sat across the table from him. Both gave him cursory nods. Hope\u2019s expression was sullen, and the General\u2019s boisterous spirits of a few minutes ago seemed to have fled. Haley supposed that they were still nourishing the unpleasantness of the previous afternoon. Uncomfortable in that sort of silence, Haley tried to break it again. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice morning,\u201d he said.\nThe General looked up. \u201cBrush your teeth this morning, boy?\u201d\n\u201cYessir.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the General firmly. \u201cDirtiest place in the world, next to the fingernails, the human mouth is.\u201d\n\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d muttered Hope. Haley was grateful that only he seemed to have heard her. The General gave no sign, devoting his full attention to the flapjacks Annie had placed before him. As had been the case at supper the night before, the General was the first to be served. Haley gathered that it was customary not to talk during breakfast.", -0.0009308198261686594], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["haley", 0.03571428571428571],

Is that it, sir?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, allrighty. You just watch the bulletin board. Annie keeps it up for me, and it\u2019ll help you stay out of mischief. Your name appeared on it for the first time today.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did it say about me?\u201d asked Haley, with a trace of anxiety.\n\u201cYou get up at 5 sharp, take a cold shower, brush your teeth for two minutes, pick up your pajamas and hang them on the hook inside the closet door; eat breakfast, go help with the haying, eat lunch, go out and hay some more; eat supper, listen to the radio for an hour, brush your teeth for two minutes, take a cold shower, hang up your clothes, and go to bed. Every minute\u2019s accounted for,\u201d said the General proudly. He looked again at the kitchen clock. \u201cH-hour,\u201d he announced, and D-squad marched out into the vermilion sunrise.\nBy 11 a.m. the wagon was stacked high with the day\u2019s sixth load of hay. The hay, the General had explained to Haley, had been pounded and bound into bales by a machine that had passed over the field the day before. The dense bundles were as high as Haley\u2019s chest, weighed about half of what he imagined Hope to weigh, and were as wide and thick as the General\u2019s middle. There was room for three more bales on top. Haley hung his baling hook on a wheel spoke, swept away the sweat that streamed into his eyes, and begged for a rest.\n\u201cYou just had a rest period, Haley,\u201d said the General. \u201cYou\u2019ll find you won\u2019t get tired as quickly if you keep at it steadily. Breaking up your rhythm with rest periods all the time, no wonder you\u2019re pooped. You\u2019ll never get your second wind that way.\u201d He was atop the load, reins in hand, with Hope seated beside him, her legs dangling over the side.\nHaley shook his head wearily, and sat down on the ground, panting, wishing to Heaven that the nightmare of heat, creeping time, and lamed muscles would end. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right in a minute, I guess \u2014 soon as I get my breath,\u201d he said. Mr. Banghart, who had been working on the opposite side of the wagon, walked over to him and told him to climb onto the wagon, that he would finish the load.\n\u201cLet him learn to pull his own weight, Mr. Banghart,\u201d warned the General. \u201cHe can do it. Come on, boy, three to go.\u201d\nLimply, painfully, Haley sank his hook into a nearby bale. He worried it along the ground to the wagon. Hope waited, hook poised, for him to swing it upward to where she could catch it and drag it into place.\n\u201cPut your back into it, boy,\u201d shouted the General, and Haley swung the bale.

I don\u2019t know what we are now. Telephoners, I guess. We telephone a lot\u2014or I do, anyway, late at night.\nA couple of weeks after I telephoned my old war buddy, Bernard V. O\u2019Hare, I really did go to see him. That must have been in 1964 or so\u2014whatever the last year was for the New York World\u2019s Fair. Eheu, fugaces labuntur anni. My name is Yon Yonson. There was a young man from Stamboul.\nI took two little girls with me, my daughter, Nanny, and her best friend, Allison Mitchell. They had never been off Cape Cod before. When we saw a river, we had to stop so they could stand by it and think about it for a while. They had never seen water in that long and narrow, unsalted form before. The river was the Hudson. There were carp in there and we saw them. They were as big as atomic submarines.\nWe saw waterfalls, too, streams jumping off cliffs into the valley of the Delaware. There were lots of things to stop and see\u2014and then it was time to go, always time to go. The little girls were wearing white party dresses and black party shoes, so strangers would know at once how nice they were. \u201cTime to go, girls,\u201d I\u2019d say. And we would go.\nAnd the sun went down, and we had supper in an Italian place, and then I knocked on the front door of the beautiful stone house of Bernard V. O\u2019Hare. I was carrying a bottle of Irish whiskey like a dinner bell.\nI met his nice wife, Mary, to whom I dedicate this book. I dedicate it to Gerhard M\u00fcller, the Dresden taxi driver, too. Mary O\u2019Hare is a trained nurse, which is a lovely thing for a woman to be.\nMary admired the two little girls I\u2019d brought, mixed them in with her own children, sent them all upstairs to play games and watch television. It was only after the children were gone that I sensed that Mary didn\u2019t like me or didn\u2019t like something about the night. She was polite but chilly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice cozy house you have here,\u201d I said, and it really was.\n\u201cI\u2019ve fixed up a place where you can talk and not be bothered,\u201d she said.\n\u201cGood,\u201d I said, and I imagined two leather chairs near a fire in a paneled room, where two old soldiers could drink and talk. But she took us into the kitchen. She had put two straight-backed chairs at a kitchen table with a white porcelain top. That table top was screaming with reflected light from a two-hundred-watt bulb overhead. Mary had prepared an operating room. She put only one glass on it, which was for me. She explained that O\u2019Hare couldn\u2019t drink the hard stuff since the war.", 0.1404871889627987], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["constant", 0.09183673469387756], ["rumfoord", 0.07142857142857142], ["hand", 0.030612244897959183], ["palm", 0.02040816326530612], ["man", 0.02040816326530612], ["deny", 0.02040816326530612], ["small", 0.02040816326530612], ["luck", 0.02040816326530612], ["shook", 0.02040816326530612], ["concept", 0.01020408163265306], ["phenomenon", 0.01020408163265306], ["suddenly", 0.01020408163265306], ["attribute", 0.01020408163265306], ["wave", 0.01020408163265306], ["hard", 0.01020408163265306], ["fantastically", 0.01020408163265306], ["ceiling", 0.01020408163265306], ["trade", 0.01020408163265306], ["single", 0.01020408163265306], ["financially", 0.01020408163265306], ["likes", 0.01020408163265306], ["aspect", 0.01020408163265306], ["forgot", 0.01020408163265306], ["wonderful", 0.01020408163265306], ["liking", 0.01020408163265306], ["shrugged", 0.01020408163265306], ["bullied", 0.01020408163265306], ["horny", 0.01020408163265306], ["betelgeuse", 0.01020408163265306], ["thought", 0.01020408163265306], ["guess", 0.01020408163265306], ["tone", 0.01020408163265306], ["calluses", 0.01020408163265306], ["sun", 0.01020408163265306], ["reminded", 0.01020408163265306], ["imagined", 0.01020408163265306], ["unquestionable", 0.01020408163265306], ["won", 0.01020408163265306], ["labors", 0.01020408163265306], ["electrical", 0.01020408163265306], ["perfectly", 0.01020408163265306], ["tingled", 0.01020408163265306], ["inferior", 0.01020408163265306], ["callused", 0.01020408163265306], ["node", 0.01020408163265306], ["head", 0.01020408163265306], ["good", 0.01020408163265306], ["happy", 0.01020408163265306], ["doomed", 0.01020408163265306], ["male", 0.01020408163265306], ["handshake", 0.01020408163265306], ["leisure", 0.01020408163265306], ["charming", 0.01020408163265306], ["extending", 0.01020408163265306], ["moment", 0.01020408163265306], ["touching", 0.01020408163265306], ["putting", 0.01020408163265306], ["demonstrating", 0.01020408163265306], ["hands", 0.01020408163265306], ["active", 0.01020408163265306], ["materialization", 0.01020408163265306], ["strong", 0.01020408163265306], ["opportunity", 0.01020408163265306], ["class", 0.01020408163265306], ["feeling", 0.01020408163265306], ["clawlike", 0.01020408163265306], ["flow", 0.01020408163265306], ["days", 0.01020408163265306], ["unmistakable", 0.01020408163265306], ["looked", 0.01020408163265306], ["conversation", 0.01020408163265306], ["female", 0.01020408163265306], ["superiority", 0.01020408163265306], ["invitation", 0.01020408163265306], ["simply", 0.01020408163265306], ["shaking", 0.01020408163265306]], "sentiment": ["\"That might be putting it a little too strong,\" said Constant.\n\"You won\u2019t deny you\u2019ve had fantastically good luck financially,\" said Rumfoord.\nConstant shook his head. \"No. That would be hard to deny,\" he said.\n\"And to what do you attribute this wonderful luck of yours?\" said Rumfoord.\nConstant shrugged. \"Who knows?\" he said. \"I guess somebody up there likes me,\" he said.\nRumfoord looked up at the ceiling. \"What a charming concept\u2014someone\u2019s liking you up there.\"\nConstant, who had been shaking hands with Rumfoord during the conversation, thought of his own hand, suddenly, as small and clawlike.\nRumfoord\u2019s palm was callused, but not horny like the palm of a man doomed to a single trade for all of his days.

at Kennedy International Airport in New York City. He had just pauperized and deserted his seventeenth wife\u2014a seventy-year-old widow in Skokie, Illinois, right outside Chicago. Guayaquil sounded to him like the last place she would ever think of looking for him.\nThis woman was so ugly and stupid, she probably never should have been born. And yet Wait was the second person to have married her.\nAnd he wasn\u2019t going to stay at the El Dorado very long, either, since he had bought a ticket for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d from the travel agent who had a desk in the lobby. It was late in the afternoon now, and hotter than the hinges of hell outside. There was no breeze outside, but he did not care, since he was inside, and the hotel was air conditioned, and he would soon be away from there anyway. His ship, the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, was scheduled to sail at high noon on the very next day, which was Friday, November 28, 1986\u2014a million years ago.\nThe bay for which Wait\u2019s means of transportation was named fanned south from the Gal\u00e1pagos Island of Genovesa. Wait had never heard of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands before. He expected them to be like Hawaii, where he had once honeymooned, or Guam, where he had once hidden out\u2014with broad white beaches and blue lagoons and swaying palms and nut-brown native girls.\nThe travel agent had given him a brochure which described the cruise, but Wait hadn\u2019t looked inside it yet. It was supine on the bar in front of him. The brochure was truthful about how forbidding most of the islands were, and warned prospective passengers, as the hotel travel agent had not warned Wait, that they had better be in reasonably good physical condition and have sturdy boots and rough clothing, since they would often have to wade ashore and scramble up rock faces like amphibious infantry.\nDarwin Bay was named in honor of the great English scientist Charles Darwin, who had visited Genovesa and several of its neighbors for five weeks back in 1835\u2014when he was a mere stripling of twenty-six, nine years younger than Wait. Darwin was then the unpaid naturalist aboard Her Majesty\u2019s Ship Beagle, on a mapping expedition that would take him completely around the world and would last five years.\nIn the cruise brochure, which was intended to delight nature-lovers rather than pleasure-seekers, Darwin\u2019s own description of a typical Gal\u00e1pagos Island was reproduced, and was taken from his first book, The Voyage of the Beagle:\n\u201cNothing could be less inviting than the first appearance. A broken field of black basaltic lava, thrown into the most rugged waves, and crossed by great fissures, is everywhere covered by stunted, sun-burnt brushwood, which shows little signs of life. The dry and parched surface, being heated by the noon-day sun, gave to the air a close and sultry feeling, like that from a stove: we fancied even that the bushes smelt unpleasantly.\u201d\nDarwin continued: \u201cThe entire surface \u2026 seems to have been permeated, like a sieve, by the subterranean vapours: here and there the lava, whilst soft, had been blown into great bubbles; and in other parts, the tops of caverns similarly formed have fallen in, leaving circular parts with steep sides.\u201d He was vividly reminded, he wrote, \u201c\u2026. of those parts of Staffordshire, where the great iron foundries are most numerous.\u201d\nThere was a portrait of Darwin behind the bar at the El Dorado, framed in shelves and bottles\u2014an enlarged reproduction of a steel engraving, depicting him not as a youth in the islands, but as a portly family man back home in England, with a beard as lush as a Christmas wreath. That same portrait was on the bosom of T-shirts for sale in the boutique, and Wait had bought two of those. That was what Darwin looked like when he was finally persuaded by friends and relatives to set down on paper his notions of how life forms everywhere, including himself and his friends and relatives, and even his Queen, had come to be as they were in the nineteenth century. He thereupon penned the most broadly influential scientific volume produced during the entire era of great big brains. It did more to stabilize people\u2019s volatile opinions of how to identify success or failure than any other tome. Imagine that! And the name of his book summed up its pitiless contents: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.", 0.08918246237889092], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["died", 0.030927835051546393], ["private", 0.020618556701030927], ["close", 0.020618556701030927], ["paul", 0.020618556701030927], ["edith", 0.020618556701030927], ["beach", 0.020618556701030927], ["york", 0.020618556701030927], ["slazinger", 0.020618556701030927], ["witch", 0.020618556701030927], ["word", 0.020618556701030927], ["city", 0.020618556701030927], ["afternoon", 0.020618556701030927], ["swim", 0.010309278350515464], ["love", 0.010309278350515464], ["human", 0.010309278350515464], ["spooky", 0.010309278350515464], ["modern", 0.010309278350515464], ["head", 0.010309278350515464], ["years", 0.010309278350515464], ["embarrassed", 0.010309278350515464], ["heard", 0.010309278350515464], ["erotic", 0.010309278350515464], ["mile", 0.010309278350515464], ["maidstone", 0.010309278350515464], ["sea", 0.010309278350515464], ["soul", 0.010309278350515464], ["art", 0.010309278350515464], ["border", 0.010309278350515464], ["egg", 0.010309278350515464], ["inn", 0.010309278350515464], ["iguana", 0.010309278350515464], ["write", 0.010309278350515464], ["eye", 0.010309278350515464], ["persuaded", 0.010309278350515464], ["stuck", 0.010309278350515464], ["summed", 0.010309278350515464], ["twenty", 0.010309278350515464], ["house", 0.010309278350515464], ["physique", 0.010309278350515464], ["dressed", 0.010309278350515464], ["parents", 0.010309278350515464], ["wandered", 0.010309278350515464], ["autobiography", 0.010309278350515464], ["gutshot", 0.010309278350515464], ["hamptons", 0.010309278350515464], ["time", 0.010309278350515464], ["reply", 0.010309278350515464], ["public", 0.010309278350515464], ["hates", 0.010309278350515464], ["knowing", 0.010309278350515464], ["scrambled", 0.010309278350515464], ["staying", 0.010309278350515464], ["ludicrous", 0.010309278350515464], ["relationship", 0.010309278350515464], ["sitting", 0.010309278350515464], ["mess", 0.010309278350515464], ["incidentally", 0.010309278350515464], ["met", 0.010309278350515464], ["reason", 0.010309278350515464], ["eyed", 0.010309278350515464], ["sunbathe", 0.010309278350515464], ["half", 0.010309278350515464], ["condition", 0.010309278350515464], ["staring", 0.010309278350515464], ["village", 0.010309278350515464], ["distance", 0.010309278350515464], ["woman", 0.010309278350515464], ["terrible", 0.010309278350515464], ["room", 0.010309278350515464], ["embarrassment", 0.010309278350515464], ["elected", 0.010309278350515464], ["fully", 0.010309278350515464], ["dog", 0.010309278350515464], ["walked", 0.010309278350515464], ["patch", 0.010309278350515464], ["ugly", 0.010309278350515464], ["sand", 0.010309278350515464], ["berman", 0.010309278350515464], ["curious", 0.010309278350515464], ["senior", 0.010309278350515464], ["dip", 0.010309278350515464], ["hello", 0.010309278350515464], ["fact", 0.010309278350515464], ["minded", 0.010309278350515464]], "sentiment": ["There is nothing erotic about our relationship.

Enough is enough.\nHere is how we met: she wandered onto my private beach alone one afternoon, not knowing it was private. She had never heard of me, since she hates modern art. She didn\u2019t know a soul in the Hamptons, and was staying in the Maidstone Inn in the village about a mile and a half from here. She had walked from there to the public beach, and then across my border.\nI went down for my afternoon dip, and there she was, fully dressed, and doing what Paul Slazinger does so much of: sitting on sand and staring out to sea. The only reason I minded her being there, or anybody\u2019s being there, was my ludicrous physique and the fact I would have to take off my eye patch before I went in. There\u2019s quite a mess under there, not unlike a scrambled egg. I was embarrassed to be seen up close.\nPaul Slazinger says, incidentally, that the human condition can be summed up in just one word, and this is the word: Embarrassment.\nSo I elected not to swim, but to sunbathe some distance away from her.\nI did, however, come close enough to say, \u201cHello.\u201d\nThis was her curious reply: \u201cTell me how your parents died.\u201d\nWhat a spooky woman! She could be a witch. Who but a witch could have persuaded me to write my autobiography?\nShe has just stuck her head in the room to say that it was time I went to New York City, where I haven\u2019t been since Edith died.

The Red Badge of Courage, The Iliad and The Odyssey, Crime and Punishment, The Bible, and \u201cThe Charge of the Light Brigade\u201d\u2014are all about what a bummer it is to be a human being? (Isn\u2019t it such a relief to have somebody say that?)\nEvolution can go to hell as far as I am concerned. What a mistake we are. We have mortally wounded this sweet life-supporting planet\u2014the only one in the whole Milky Way\u2014with a century of transportation whoopee. Our government is conducting a war against drugs, is it? Let them go after petroleum. Talk about a destructive high! You put some of this stuff in your car and you can go a hundred miles an hour, run over the neighbor\u2019s dog, and tear the atmosphere to smithereens. Hey, as long as we are stuck with being homo sapiens, why mess around? Let\u2019s wreck the whole joint. Anybody got an atomic bomb? Who doesn\u2019t have an atomic bomb nowadays?\nBut I have to say this in defense of humankind: In no matter what era in history, including the Garden of Eden, everybody just got here. And, except for the Garden of Eden, there were already all these games going on that could make you act crazy, even if you weren\u2019t crazy to begin with. Some of the crazymaking games going on today are love and hate, liberalism and conservatism, automobiles and credit cards, golf, and girls\u2019 basketball.\nI am one of America\u2019s Great Lakes people, her freshwater people, not an oceanic but a continental people. Whenever I swim in an ocean, I feel as though I am swimming in chicken soup.\nLike me, many American socialists were freshwater people. Most Americans don\u2019t know what the socialists did during the first half of the past century with art, with eloquence, with organizing skills, to elevate the self-respect, the dignity and political acumen of American wage earners, of our working class.\nThat wage earners, without social position or higher education or wealth, are of inferior intellect is surely belied by the fact that two of the most splendid writers and speakers on the deepest subjects in American history were self-taught workmen. I speak, of course, of Carl Sandburg the poet from Illinois, and Abraham Lincoln of Kentucky, then Indiana, and finally Illinois. Both, may I say, were continental, freshwater people like me. Another freshwater person and splendid speaker was the Socialist Party candidate Eugene Victor Debs, a former locomotive fireman who had been born to a middle class family in Terra Haute, Indiana.\nHooray for our team!\n\u201cSocialism\u201d is no more an evil word than \u201cChristianity.\u201d Socialism no more prescribed Joseph Stalin and his secret police and shuttered churches than Christianity prescribed the Spanish Inquisition. Christianity and socialism alike, in fact, prescribe a society dedicated to the proposition that all men, women, and children are created equal and shall not starve.\nAdolf Hitler, incidentally, was a two-fer. He named his party the National Socialists, the Nazis. Hitler\u2019s swastika wasn\u2019t a pagan symbol, as so many people believe. It was a working person\u2019s Christian cross, made of axes, of tools.\nAbout Stalin\u2019s shuttered churches, and those in China today: Such suppression of religion was supposedly justified by Karl Marx\u2019s statement that \u201creligion is the opium of the people.\u201d Marx said that back in 1844, when opium and opium derivatives were the only effective painkillers anyone could take. Marx himself had taken them. He was grateful for the temporary relief they had given him. He was simply noticing, and surely not condemning, the fact that religion could also be comforting to those in economic or social distress.

business school graduates dominate book publishing. They feel that money spent on someone\u2019s first novel is good money down a rat hole. They are right. It almost always is.\nSo, as I say, I think I belong to America\u2019s last generation of novelists. Novelists will come one by one from now on, not in seeming families, and will perhaps write only one or two novels, and let it go at that. Many will have inherited or married money.\nThe most influential of my bunch, in my opinion, is still J. D. Salinger, although he has been silent for years. The most promising was perhaps Edward Lewis Wallant, who died so young. And it is my thinking about the death of James Jones two years ago, who was not all that young, who was almost exactly my age, which accounts for the autumnal mood of this book. There have been other reminders of my own mortality, to be sure, but the death of Jones is central\u2014perhaps because I see his widow Gloria so often and because he, too, was a self-educated midwesterner, and because he, too, in a major adventure for all of us, which was the Second World War, had been an enlisted man. And let it here be noted that the best-known members of my literary generation, if they wrote about war, almost unanimously despised officers and made heroes of sketchily educated, aggressively unaristocratic enlisted men.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJames Jones told me one time that his publisher and Ernest Hemingway\u2019s, Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, had once hoped to get Jones and Hemingway together\u2014so that they could enjoy each other\u2019s company as old warriors.\nJones declined, by his own account, because he did not regard Hemingway as a fellow soldier. He said Hemingway in wartime was free to come and go from the fighting as pleased, and to take time off for a fine meal or woman or whatever. Real soldiers, according to Jones, damn well had to stay where they were told, or go where they were told, and eat swill, and take the worst the enemy had to throw at them day after day, week after week.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt may be that the most striking thing about members of my literary generation in retrospect will be that we were allowed to say absolutely anything without fear of punishment. Our American heirs may find it incredible, as most foreigners do right now, that a nation would want to enforce as a law something which sounds more like a dream, which reads as follows:\n\u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d\nHow could a nation with such a law raise its children in an atmosphere of decency? It couldn\u2019t\u2014it can\u2019t. So the law will surely be repealed soon for the sake of children.", 0.24331259018759024], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["george", 0.059322033898305086], ["jenny", 0.03389830508474576], ["wasn", 0.025423728813559324], ["mart", 0.025423728813559324], ["big", 0.01694915254237288], ["stopped", 0.01694915254237288], ["toes", 0.01694915254237288], ["story", 0.01694915254237288], ["cab", 0.01694915254237288], ["close", 0.01694915254237288], ["throat", 0.01694915254237288], ["drink", 0.01694915254237288], ["bottle", 0.01694915254237288], ["time", 0.01694915254237288], ["shoes", 0.00847457627118644], ["toddled", 0.00847457627118644], ["booze", 0.00847457627118644], ["windshield", 0.00847457627118644], ["eyes", 0.00847457627118644], ["milk", 0.00847457627118644], ["slunk", 0.00847457627118644], ["thinking", 0.00847457627118644], ["jim", 0.00847457627118644], ["day", 0.00847457627118644], ["window", 0.00847457627118644], ["crying", 0.00847457627118644], ["glanced", 0.00847457627118644], ["orange", 0.00847457627118644], ["smile", 0.00847457627118644], ["weeks", 0.00847457627118644], ["good", 0.00847457627118644], ["couple", 0.00847457627118644], ["drinking", 0.00847457627118644], ["years", 0.00847457627118644], ["realize", 0.00847457627118644], ["chuckled", 0.00847457627118644], ["morning", 0.00847457627118644], ["audience", 0.00847457627118644], ["miles", 0.00847457627118644], ["truth", 0.00847457627118644], ["sigh", 0.00847457627118644], ["forgot", 0.00847457627118644], ["laboratory", 0.00847457627118644], ["blue", 0.00847457627118644], ["clock", 0.00847457627118644], ["told", 0.00847457627118644], ["body", 0.00847457627118644], ["shut", 0.00847457627118644], ["scientific", 0.00847457627118644], ["seconds", 0.00847457627118644], ["sonny", 0.00847457627118644], ["staring", 0.00847457627118644], ["boy", 0.00847457627118644], ["flawless", 0.00847457627118644], ["spilt", 0.00847457627118644], ["beautiful", 0.00847457627118644], ["three", 0.00847457627118644], ["van", 0.00847457627118644], ["top", 0.00847457627118644], ["watering", 0.00847457627118644], ["hey", 0.00847457627118644], ["stuck", 0.00847457627118644], ["white", 0.00847457627118644], ["head", 0.00847457627118644], ["baloney", 0.00847457627118644], ["stinging", 0.00847457627118644], ["depressing", 0.00847457627118644], ["excuse", 0.00847457627118644], ["controlling", 0.00847457627118644], ["sunshiny", 0.00847457627118644], ["pull", 0.00847457627118644], ["rippling", 0.00847457627118644], ["trick", 0.00847457627118644], ["silly", 0.00847457627118644], ["yelled", 0.00847457627118644], ["streak", 0.00847457627118644], ["heart", 0.00847457627118644], ["ready", 0.00847457627118644], ["life", 0.00847457627118644], ["juice", 0.00847457627118644], ["breakfast", 0.00847457627118644], ["poetry", 0.00847457627118644], ["ducked", 0.00847457627118644], ["party", 0.00847457627118644], ["hamming", 0.00847457627118644], ["moving", 0.00847457627118644], ["cleared", 0.00847457627118644], ["refrigerator", 0.00847457627118644], ["kid", 0.00847457627118644], ["presto", 0.00847457627118644], ["dared", 0.00847457627118644], ["truck", 0.00847457627118644], ["gha", 0.00847457627118644], ["spend", 0.00847457627118644], ["talk", 0.00847457627118644]], "sentiment": ["It was such a silly story, I forgot it as soon as I\u2019d chuckled at it.

This great humanitarian, and he was a humanitarian in the profoundest sense of the word, took command of the Roman Empire in a degenerate period strikingly like our own. Harlotry, divorce, alcoholism, liberalism, homosexuality, pornography, abortion, venality, murder, labor racketeering, juvenile delinquency, cowardice, atheism, extortion, slander, and theft were the height of fashion. Rome was a paradise for gangsters, perverts, and the lazy working man, just as America is now. As in America now, forces of law and order were openly attacked by mobs, children were disobedient, had no respect for their parents or their country, and no decent woman was safe on any street, even at high noon! And cunning, sharp-trading, bribing foreigners were in the ascendency everywhere. And ground under the heels of the big city money-changers were the honest farmers, the backbone of the Roman Army and the Roman soul.\nWhat could be done? Well, there were soft-headed liberals then as there are bubble-headed liberals now, and they said what liberals always say after they have led a great nation to such a lawless, self-indulgent, polyglot condition: \"Things have never been better! Look at all the freedom! Look at all the equality! Look how sexual hypocrisy has been driven from the scene! Oh boy! People used to get all knotted up inside when they thought about rape or fornication. Now they can do both with glee!\"\nAnd what did the terrible, black-spirited, non-fun-loving conservatives of those happy days have to say? Well, there weren't many of them left. They were dying off in ridiculed old age. And their children had been turned against them by the liberals, by the purveyors of synthetic sunshine and moonshine, by the something-for-nothing political strip-teasers, by the people who loved everybody, including the barbarians, by people who loved the barbarians so much they wanted to open all the gates, have all the soldiers lay their weapons down, and let the barbarians come in!\nThat was the Rome that Caesar Augustus came home to, after defeating those two sex maniacs, Antony and Cleopatra, in the great sea battle of Actium. And I don't think I have to re-create the things he thought when he surveyed the Rome he was said to rule. Let us take a moment of silence, and let each think what he will of the stews of today.\nThere was a moment of silence, too, about thirty seconds that seemed to some like a thousand years.\nAnd what methods did Caesar Augustus use to put this disorderly house in order? He did what we are so often told we must never, ever do, what we are told will never, ever work: he wrote morals into law, and he enforced those unenforceable laws with a police force that was cruel and unsmiling. He made it illegal for a Roman to behave like a pig. Do you hear me? It became illegal! And Romans caught acting like pigs were strung up by their thumbs, thrown down wells, fed to lions, and given other experiences that might impress them with the desirability of being more decent and reliable than they were. Did it work? You bet your boots it did! Pigs miraculously disappeared! And what do we call the period that followed this now-unthinkable oppression? Nothing more nor less, friends and neighbors, than \"The Golden Age of Rome.\"\nAm I suggesting that we follow this gory example? Of course I am. Scarcely a day has passed during which I have not said in one way or another: \"Let us force Americans to be as good as they should be.\" Am I in favor of feeding labor crooks to lions? Well, to give those who get such satisfaction from imagining that I am covered with primordial scales a little twinge of pleasure, let me say, \"Yes. Absolutely. This afternoon, if it can be arranged.\" To disappoint my critics, let me add that I am only fooling. I am not entertained by cruel and unusual punishments, not in the least. I am fascinated by the fact that a carrot and a stick can make a donkey go, and that his Space Age discovery may have some application in the world of human beings.\nAnd so on. The Senator said that the carrot and the stick had been built into the Free Enterprise System, as conceived by the Founding Fathers, but that do-gooders, who thought people shouldn't ever have to struggle for anything, had buggered the logic of the system beyond all recognition.\nIn summation: he said, I see two alternatives before us. We can write morals into law, and enforce those morals harshly, or we can return to a true Free Enterprise System, which has the sink-or-swim justice of Caesar Augustus built into it. I emphatically favor the latter alternative. We must be hard, for we must become again a nation of swimmers, with the sinkers quietly disposing of themselves. I have spoken of another hard time in ancient history. In case you have forgotten the name of it, I shall refresh your memories: \"The Golden Age of Rome,\" friends and neighbors, \"The Golden Age of Rome.\"\nAs for friends who might have helped Eliot through his time of troubles: he didn't have any.

We were in his Plymouth sedan. He was driving. Some fifteen years later he would be arrested for driving through a red light. It would be discovered that he had not had a driver\u2019s license for twenty years\u2014which means that he was not licensed even on the day we had lunch with Powers Hapgood.\nHis house was out in the country some. When we got to the edge of the city, he said that if we were lucky we would see a funny dog. It was a German shepherd, he said, who could hardly stand up because he had been hit so often by automobiles. The dog still came tottering out to chase them, his eyes filled with bravery and rage.\nBut the dog did not appear that day. He really did exist. I would see him another day, when I was driving alone. He was crouched down on the shoulder of the road, ready to sink his teeth into my right front tire. But his charge was a pitiful thing to see. His rear end hardly worked at all anymore. He might as well have been dragging a steamer trunk with the power in his front feet alone.\nThat was the day on which the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut back to the day on which I lunched with Powers Hapgood:\nWhen Father put the car into his garage, he finally said something about the lunch.

Borgorov was struggling up the path from far below. \u201cIt\u2019s no curiosity, and you know it, Josef,\u201d said Peter. \u201cWhat happened to those ants is happening to us.\u201d\n\u201cHush!\u201d said Josef desperately.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the ones without pincers, Josef.

about nothing but the ammunition business, there was a microscopic possibility, I suppose, that I called in a white-phosphorus barrage or a napalm air strike on a returning Jesus Christ.\nI NEVER WANTED to be a professional soldier, although I turned out to be a good one, if there can be such a thing. The idea that I should go to West Point came up as unexpectedly as the finale of the Vietnam War, near the end of my senior year in high school. I was all set to go to the University of Michigan, and take courses in English and History and Political Science, and work on the student daily paper there in preparation for a career as a journalist.\nBut all of a sudden my father, who was a chemical engineer involved in making plastics with a half-life of 50,000 years, and as full of excrement as a Christmas turkey, said I should go to West Point instead. He had never been in the military himself. During World War II, he was too valuable as a civilian deep-thinker about chemicals to be put in a soldier suit and turned into a suicidal, homicidal imbecile in 13 weeks.\nI had already been accepted by the University of Michigan, when this offer to me of an appointment to the United States Military Academy came out of the blue. The offer arrived at a low point in my father\u2019s life, when he needed something to boast about which would impress our simple-minded neighbors. They would think an appointment to West Point was a great prize, like being picked for a professional baseball team.\nSo he said to me, as I used to say to infantry replacements fresh off the boat or plane in Vietnam, \u201cThis is a great opportunity.\u201d\nWHAT I WOULD really like to have been, given a perfect world, is a jazz pianist. I mean jazz. I don\u2019t mean rock and roll. I mean the never-the-same-way-twice music the American black people gave the world. I played piano in my own all-white band in my all-white high school in Midland City, Ohio. We called ourselves \u201cThe Soul Merchants.\u201d\nHow good were we? We had to play white people\u2019s popular music, or nobody would have hired us. But every so often we would cut loose with jazz anyway. Nobody else seemed to notice the difference, but we sure did. We fell in love with ourselves. We were in ecstasy.\nFATHER SHOULD NEVER have made me go to West Point.\nNever mind what he did to the environment with his non-biodegradable plastics. Look what he did to me! What a boob he was! And my mother agreed with every decision he ever made, which makes her another blithering nincompoop.\nThey were both killed 20 years ago in a freak accident in a gift shop on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, which the Indians in this valley used to call \u201cThunder Beaver,\u201d when the roof fell in.", 0.16771886446886447], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["dr",

was saying, but somewhat less than he himself thought. He did not believe in ghosts, for instance\u2014and had yet to learn of the Thanasphere.\nDr. Groszinger rested his long legs on his cluttered desktop, and watched his secretary conduct the disappointed newsman through the locked door, past the armed guards. He lit a cigarette and tried to relax before going back into the stale air and tension of the radio room. IS YOUR SAFE LOCKED? asked a sign on the wall, tacked there by a diligent security officer. The sign annoyed him. Security officers, security regulations only served to slow his work, to make him think about things he had no time to think about.\nThe secret papers in the safe weren\u2019t secrets. They said what had been known for centuries: Given fundamental physics, it follows that a projectile fired into space in direction x, at y miles per hour, will travel in the arc z. Dr. Groszinger modified the equation: Given fundamental physics and one billion dollars.\nImpending war had offered him the opportunity to try the experiment. The threat of war was an incident, the military men about him an irritating condition of work\u2014the experiment was the heart of the matter.\nThere were no unknowns, he reflected, finding contentment in the dependability of the physical world. Young Dr. Groszinger smiled, thinking of Christopher Columbus and his crew, who hadn\u2019t known what lay ahead of them, who had been scared stiff by sea monsters that didn\u2019t exist. Maybe the average person of today felt the same way about space. The Age of Superstition still had a few years to run.\nBut the man in the spaceship two thousand miles from earth had no unknowns to fear. The sullen Major Allen Rice would have nothing surprising to report in his radio messages. He could only confirm what reason had already revealed about outer space.\nThe major American observatories, working closely with the project, reported that the ship was now moving around the earth in the predicted orbit at the predicted velocity. Soon, anytime now, the first message in history from outer space would be received in the radio room. The broadcast could be on an ultra-high-frequency band where no one had ever sent or received messages before.\nThe first message was overdue, but nothing had gone wrong\u2014nothing could go wrong, Dr. Groszinger assured himself again. Machines, not men, were guiding the flight. The man was a mere observer, piloted to his lonely vantage point by infallible electronic brains, swifter than his own. He had controls in his ship, but only for gliding down through the atmosphere, when and if they brought him back from space. He was equipped to stay for several years.\nEven the man was as much like a machine as possible, Dr. Groszinger thought with satisfaction. He was quick, strong, unemotional. Psychiatrists had picked Major Rice from a hundred volunteers, and predicted that he would function as perfectly as the rocket motors, the metal hull, and the electronic controls. His specifications: Husky, twenty-nine years of age, fifty-five missions over Europe during the Second World War without a sign of fatigue, a childless widower, melancholy and solitary, a career soldier, a demon for work.", 0.04039241622574955], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["dwayne", 0.08928571428571429], ["trout", 0.044642857142857144], ["ideas", 0.03571428571428571], ["bad", 0.03571428571428571], ["kilgore", 0.03571428571428571], ["hoover", 0.026785714285714284], ["fabulously", 0.026785714285714284], ["chemicals", 0.026785714285714284], ["yin", 0.017857142857142856], ["doodley", 0.017857142857142856], ["met", 0.017857142857142856], ["squat", 0.017857142857142856], ["dead", 0.017857142857142856], ["yang", 0.017857142857142856], ["supposed", 0.017857142857142856], ["insane", 0.008928571428571428], ["body", 0.008928571428571428], ["hoped", 0.008928571428571428], ["madness", 0.008928571428571428], ["looked", 0.008928571428571428], ["chinese", 0.008928571428571428], ["mind", 0.008928571428571428], ["owned", 0.008928571428571428], ["1972", 0.008928571428571428], ["autumn", 0.008928571428571428], ["course", 0.008928571428571428], ["shape", 0.008928571428571428], ["americans", 0.008928571428571428], ["human", 0.008928571428571428], ["fellow", 0.008928571428571428], ["encounter", 0.008928571428571428], ["turn", 0.008928571428571428], ["dealer", 0.008928571428571428], ["alive", 0.008928571428571428], ["monster", 0.008928571428571428], ["city", 0.008928571428571428], ["arts", 0.008928571428571428], ["america", 0.008928571428571428], ["symbols", 0.008928571428571428], ["midland", 0.008928571428571428], ["craziness", 0.008928571428571428], ["festival", 0.008928571428571428], ["incipient", 0.008928571428571428], ["novice", 0.008928571428571428], ["needed", 0.008928571428571428], ["harmony", 0.008928571428571428], ["holding", 0.008928571428571428], ["learned", 0.008928571428571428], ["lunatics", 0.008928571428571428], ["friend", 0.008928571428571428], ["whispered", 0.008928571428571428], ["direction", 0.008928571428571428], ["good", 0.008928571428571428], ["pontiac", 0.008928571428571428], ["delivered", 0.008928571428571428], ["grabbing", 0.008928571428571428], ["attention", 0.008928571428571428], ["paid", 0.008928571428571428], ["insanity", 0.008928571428571428], ["harmless", 0.008928571428571428], ["hands", 0.008928571428571428], ["invisible", 0.008928571428571428], ["hold", 0.008928571428571428], ["exact", 0.008928571428571428], ["grab", 0.008928571428571428], ["man", 0.008928571428571428], ["town", 0.008928571428571428], ["going", 0.008928571428571428], ["couldn", 0.008928571428571428], ["manufacturing", 0.008928571428571428], ["considered", 0.008928571428571428], ["days", 0.008928571428571428], ["walked", 0.008928571428571428], ["morning", 0.008928571428571428], ["planet", 0.008928571428571428], ["matter", 0.008928571428571428], ["unbalanced", 0.008928571428571428]], "sentiment": ["Everybody in America was supposed to grab whatever he could and hold on to it.
