after having announced that the arch-tyranny of Barnhouse was at an end. But those who would make war if they could, in every country in the world, wait in sullen silence for what must come\u2014the passing of Professor Barnhouse.\nTo ask how much longer the professor will live is to ask how much longer we must wait for the blessings of another world war. He is of short-lived stock: his mother lived to be fifty-three, his father to be forty-nine; and the life-spans of his grandparents on both sides were of the same order. He might be expected to live, then, for perhaps fifteen years more, if he can remain hidden from his enemies. When one considers the number and vigor of these enemies, however, fifteen years seems an extraordinary length of time, which might better be revised to fifteen days, hours, or minutes.\nThe professor knows that he cannot live much longer. I say this because of the message left in my mailbox on Christmas Eve. Unsigned, typewritten on a soiled scrap of paper, the note consisted of ten sentences. The first nine of these, each a bewildering tangle of psychological jargon and references to obscure texts, made no sense to me at first reading. The tenth, unlike the rest, was simply constructed and contained no large words\u2014but its irrational content made it the most puzzling and bizarre sentence of all. I nearly threw the note away, thinking it a colleague\u2019s warped notion of a practical joke. For some reason, though, I added it to the clutter on top of my desk, which included, among other mementos, the professor\u2019s dice.\nIt took me several weeks to realize that the message really meant something, that the first nine sentences, when unsnarled, could be taken as instructions. The tenth still told me nothing. It was only last night that I discovered how it fitted in with the rest. The sentence appeared in my thoughts last night, while I was toying absently with the professor\u2019s dice.\nI promised to have this report on its way to the publishers today. In view of what has happened, I am obliged to break that promise, or release the report incomplete. The delay will not be a long one, for one of the few blessings accorded a bachelor like myself is the ability to move quickly from one abode to another, or from one way of life to another. What property I want to take with me can be packed in a few hours. Fortunately, I am not without substantial private means, which may take as long as a week to realize in liquid and anonymous form. When this is done, I shall mail the report.\nI have just returned from a visit to my doctor, who tells me my health is excellent. I am young, and, with any luck at all, I shall live to a ripe old age indeed, for my family on both sides is noted for longevity.\nBriefly, I propose to vanish.\nSooner or later, Professor Barnhouse must die. But long before then I shall be ready. So, to the saber-rattlers of today\u2014 and even, I hope, of tomorrow\u2014I say: Be advised. Barnhouse will die. But not the Barnhouse Effect.\nLast night, I tried once more to follow the oblique instructions on the scrap of paper. I took the professor\u2019s dice, and then, with the last, nightmarish sentence flitting through my mind, I rolled fifty consecutive sevens.\nGood-by.", 0.130883912006361], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["josef", 0.05027932960893855], ["peter", 0.03910614525139665], ["ants", 0.0335195530726257], ["rock", 0.0223463687150838], ["books", 0.0223463687150838], ["lovers", 0.0223463687150838], ["pincers", 0.0223463687150838], ["find", 0.01675977653631285], ["stalin", 0.01675977653631285], ["developed", 0.0111731843575419], ["soldiers", 0.0111731843575419], ["workers", 0.0111731843575419], ["big", 0.0111731843575419], ["close", 0.0111731843575419], ["box", 0.0111731843575419], ["gaze", 0.0111731843575419], ["eyes", 0.0111731843575419], ["frowned", 0.0111731843575419], ["glass", 0.0111731843575419], ["shook", 0.0111731843575419], ["portrait", 0.0111731843575419], ["gregarious", 0.0111731843575419], ["starting", 0.0111731843575419], ["lack", 0.00558659217877095], ["rest", 0.00558659217877095], ["facilities", 0.00558659217877095], ["paper", 0.00558659217877095], ["shrewdly", 0.00558659217877095], ["fear", 0.00558659217877095], ["thumb", 0.00558659217877095], ["teeming", 0.00558659217877095], ["book", 0.00558659217877095], ["distance", 0.00558659217877095], ["specimen", 0.00558659217877095], ["number", 0.00558659217877095], ["half", 0.00558659217877095], ["sanitary", 0.00558659217877095], ["difference", 0.00558659217877095], ["differentiating", 0.00558659217877095], ["tobacco", 0.00558659217877095], ["level", 0.00558659217877095], ["cry", 0.00558659217877095], ["barracks", 0.00558659217877095], ["works", 0.00558659217877095], ["luck", 0.00558659217877095], ["art", 0.00558659217877095], ["ten", 0.00558659217877095], ["people", 0.00558659217877095], ["house", 0.00558659217877095], ["searching", 0.00558659217877095], ["picked", 0.00558659217877095], ["abominable", 0.00558659217877095], ["loathing", 0.00558659217877095], ["wander", 0.00558659217877095], ["shambled", 0.00558659217877095], ["deeply", 0.00558659217877095], ["pincered", 0.00558659217877095], ["magnifying", 0.00558659217877095], ["escaped", 0.00558659217877095], ["civilization", 0.00558659217877095], ["announced", 0.00558659217877095], ["evolving", 0.00558659217877095], ["reexamining", 0.00558659217877095], ["joy", 0.00558659217877095], ["ration", 0.00558659217877095], ["stared", 0.00558659217877095], ["shaft", 0.00558659217877095], ["houses", 0.00558659217877095], ["perplexedly", 0.00558659217877095], ["wait", 0.00558659217877095], ["distressed", 0.00558659217877095], ["uncertainly", 0.00558659217877095], ["roam", 0.00558659217877095], ["changes", 0.00558659217877095], ["family", 0.00558659217877095], ["suddenly", 0.00558659217877095], ["enigmatically", 0.00558659217877095], ["bound", 0.00558659217877095], ["weather", 0.00558659217877095], ["jammed", 0.00558659217877095], ["gatherings", 0.00558659217877095], ["thoughtfully", 0.00558659217877095], ["bizarre", 0.00558659217877095], ["tomorrow", 0.00558659217877095], ["crowd", 0.00558659217877095], ["weathered", 0.00558659217877095], ["privacy", 0.00558659217877095], ["political", 0.00558659217877095], ["three", 0.00558659217877095], ["sunlight", 0.00558659217877095], ["considerably", 0.00558659217877095], ["turned", 0.00558659217877095], ["tool", 0.00558659217877095], ["mine", 0.00558659217877095], ["mmmm", 0.00558659217877095], ["twist", 0.00558659217877095], ["protected", 0.00558659217877095], ["pictures", 0.00558659217877095], ["piece", 0.00558659217877095], ["bet", 0.00558659217877095], ["nearest", 0.00558659217877095], ["tar", 0.00558659217877095], ["beamed", 0.00558659217877095], ["modern", 0.00558659217877095], ["twinkled", 0.00558659217877095], ["head", 0.00558659217877095], ["ant", 0.00558659217877095], ["cluster", 0.00558659217877095], ["throat", 0.00558659217877095], ["wonderful", 0.00558659217877095], ["clothing", 0.00558659217877095], ["species", 0.00558659217877095], ["dozen", 0.00558659217877095], ["began", 0.00558659217877095], ["handed", 0.00558659217877095], ["interested", 0.00558659217877095], ["poster", 0.00558659217877095], ["paternally", 0.00558659217877095], ["physical", 0.00558659217877095], ["higher", 0.00558659217877095], ["picture", 0.00558659217877095], ["passionately", 0.00558659217877095], ["mouth", 0.00558659217877095], ["dust", 0.00558659217877095], ["posters", 0.00558659217877095], ["cleared", 0.00558659217877095], ["lower", 0.00558659217877095], ["third", 0.00558659217877095], ["cover", 0.00558659217877095], ["time", 0.00558659217877095]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHere\u2019s a piece of luck, Josef\u2014ten ants so close together I can cover them with my thumb.\u201d Peter picked up rock after rock, and, wherever he found one ant, he found at least a half dozen close by. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to get gregarious.\u201d\n\u201cAny physical changes?\u201d\nPeter frowned through his magnifying glass. \u201cSame species, all right.

That was a couple of years ago, so I have had a long time to think about it. I have persuaded myself that it isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s fear and laziness and realism. It\u2019s an embarrassed apology which says in effect: \u201cHey\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I probably don\u2019t like life as much as you do.\u201d\nJohn Leonard knows perfectly well who you are, and how well you write. All I had to do was mention your name. He\u2019ll give you work. We\u2019ll have him to a small dinner for you when you\u2019re next in town.\nThe past four years have been mean buggers for me. I\u2019m sure you care, so I am pleased to say that I\u2019m much better now.
