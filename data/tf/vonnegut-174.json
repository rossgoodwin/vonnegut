had actually killed his mother was preparing to land in a chartered plane at Will Fairchild Memorial Airport, on the other side of the Interstate. This was Eliot Rosewater, Kilgore Trout\u2019s patron. He killed his mother accidentally in a boating accident, when a youth. She was Women\u2019s Chess Champion of the United States of America, nineteen hundred and thirty-six years after the Son of God was born, supposedly. Rosewater killed her the year after that.\nIt was his pilot who caused the airport\u2019s runways to become an ex-convict\u2019s idea of fairyland. Rosewater remembered his mother\u2019s jewelry when the lights came on. He looked to the west, and he smiled at the rosy loveliness of the Mildred Barry Memorial Arts Center, a harvest moon on stilts in a bend of Sugar Creek. It reminded him of how his mother had looked when he saw her through the bleary eyes of infancy.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI had made him up, of course\u2014and his pilot, too. I put Colonel Looseleaf Harper, the man who had dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, at the controls.\nI made Rosewater an alcoholic in another book. I now had him reasonably well sobered up, with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. I had him use his new-found sobriety, to explore, among other things, the supposed spiritual and physical benefits of sexual orgies with strangers in New York City. He was only confused so far.\nI could have killed him, and his pilot, too, but I let them live on.

I had no use for the canvases\u2014or so I thought back then. I honestly never expected to paint again. Storing them would be no problem, since there was plenty of space in the potato barn. Could I sleep well here with the worst of the embarrassments from my past right here on the property? I hoped so.\nI heard myself say this at last: \u201cPlease\u2014don\u2019t throw them away. I will call Home Sweet Home Moving and Storage out here, and have them picked up as soon as possible. Please tell me your name again\u2014so they can ask for you.\u201d\nAnd she said this: \u201cMona Lisa Trippingham.\u201d\nWhen GEFFCo hung \u201cWindsor Blue Number Seventeen\u201d in its lobby, with fanfare about such an old company\u2019s keeping on top of the latest developments not only in technology but in the arts, the company\u2019s publicity people hoped to say that \u201cWindsor Blue Number Seventeen\u201d was superlative in terms of size\u2014if not the largest painting in the world, then at least the largest painting in New York City, or whatever. But there were several murals right in the city, and God knows in the world, which easily exceeded my painting\u2019s 512 square feet.\nThe publicity people wondered if it might not be a record holder for a painting hung on a wall\u2014ignoring the fact that it was in fact eight separate panels, mated in back with C-clamps. But that wouldn\u2019t do, either, since it turned out that the Museum of the City of New York had three continuous paintings on canvas, stitched together to be sure, as high as mine and a third again as long! They were curious artifacts\u2014an early effort at making movies, you might say, since they had rollers at either end. They could be unwound from one and rewound on the other. An audience could see only a small part of the whole at any time. These Brobdingnagian ribbons were decorated with mountains and rivers and virgin forests and limitless grasslands on which buffalo grazed, and deserts where diamonds or rubies or gold nuggets might be had for the stooping. These were the United States of America.\nLecturers traveled all over Northern Europe with such pictures in olden times.

He had to go home for the Geiger counter first. That innocent-looking mantelpiece, before which Mother had spent so many hours, either gazing into the flames or up at Father\u2019s unfinished painting, was a killer. Lowell Ulm said this: \u201cJesus Christ! This thing is hotter than a Hiroshima baby carriage!\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMother and I were moved into the new Holiday Inn, while workmen dressed like astronauts on the moon performed radical surgery on our little Avondale shitbox. The irony was, of course, that, if Mother had been a typical mother, out in the kitchen or down in the basement or out shopping most of the time, and if I had been a typical son, waiting to be fed, and lounging around the living room, I would have been the one to get the fatal dose of radiation.\nAt least Gino and Marco Maritimo were both dead by then, presumably feeling nothing. They would have been heartsick to learn that the house which they had practically given to us was so dangerous. Marco had his peephole closed by natural causes about a month before Celia Hoover\u2019s funeral, and then Gino was killed in a freak accident at the arts center a few months after that. He was trying to get the center\u2019s drawbridge to work right, with the dedication ceremonies only a week away, and he was electrocuted. Two people died during the construction of the Mildred Barry Memorial Center for the Arts.\nI have no idea how many people were killed during the construction of the Taj Mahal. Hundreds upon hundreds, probably. Beauty seldom comes cheap.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut Gino and Marco\u2019s sons certainly took the mantelpiece seriously. They were as embarrassed as their fathers would have been, and they told us a lot more than they should have, since Felix and I would eventually decide to sue their corporation and a lot of other people by and by. The mantelpiece, they told us, came from a scrap heap in weeds back of an ornamental concrete company outside of Cincinnati. Old Gino had found it there, and couldn\u2019t see anything wrong with it, and had bought it cheap for the model house, which became our house, at Avondale.\nWith a lot of luck, and the help of a few honest people, we were able to trace the cement that went into the mantelpiece all the way back to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where pure uranium 235 was produced for the bomb they dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. The government somehow allowed that cement to be sold off as war surplus, even though many people had known how hot it was.\nIn this case, the government was about as careless as a half-wit boy up in a cupola with a loaded Springfield rifle\u2014on Mother\u2019s Day.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.05617761867761869], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["wirtanen", 0.18518518518518517], ["book", 0.1111111111111111], ["bodovskov", 0.07407407407407407], ["hit", 0.07407407407407407], ["wrote", 0.07407407407407407], ["produced", 0.037037037037037035], ["crazy", 0.037037037037037035], ["plays", 0.037037037037037035], ["goblet", 0.037037037037037035], ["received", 0.037037037037037035], ["god", 0.037037037037037035], ["monogamous", 0.037037037037037035], ["casanova", 0.037037037037037035], ["write", 0.037037037037037035], ["stalin", 0.037037037037037035], ["big", 0.037037037037037035], ["biggest", 0.037037037037037035], ["memoirs", 0.037037037037037035]], "sentiment": ["\u201cMy God\u2014I did write that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d I said.\n\u201cStalin was crazy about it,\u201d said Wirtanen.\n\u201cAnd the other plays\u2014?\u201d I said.\n\u201cAll produced, all well-received,\u201d said Wirtanen.\n\u201cBut \u2018The Goblet\u2019 was Bodovskov\u2019s big hit?\u201d I said.\n\u201cThe book was the biggest hit of all,\u201d said Wirtanen.\n\u201cBodovskov wrote a book?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou wrote a book,\u201d said Wirtanen.\n\u201cI never did,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMemoirs of a Monogamous Casanova?\u201d said Wirtanen.", -0.24166666666666667], "title": "Mother Night"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["sam", 0.022222222222222223], ["house", 0.022222222222222223], ["correction", 0.022222222222222223], ["find", 0.022222222222222223], ["hearing", 0.022222222222222223], ["second", 0.022222222222222223], ["books", 0.022222222222222223], ["year", 0.022222222222222223], ["dear", 0.022222222222222223], ["51st", 0.022222222222222223], ["check", 0.022222222222222223], ["city", 0.022222222222222223], ["26", 0.022222222222222223], ["apartment", 0.022222222222222223], ["guest", 0.022222222222222223], ["exactly", 0.022222222222222223], ["lawrence", 0.022222222222222223], ["crime", 0.022222222222222223], ["better", 0.022222222222222223], ["written", 0.022222222222222223], ["strange", 0.022222222222222223], ["lot", 0.022222222222222223], ["time", 0.022222222222222223], ["hope", 0.022222222222222223], ["told", 0.022222222222222223], ["jailbird", 0.022222222222222223], ["play", 0.022222222222222223], ["good", 0.022222222222222223], ["opening", 0.022222222222222223], ["knew", 0.022222222222222223], ["kitty", 0.022222222222222223], ["cheers", 0.022222222222222223], ["york", 0.022222222222222223], ["knox", 0.022222222222222223], ["jailbirds", 0.022222222222222223], ["february", 0.022222222222222223], ["novel", 0.022222222222222223], ["barnstable", 0.022222222222222223], ["1971", 0.022222222222222223], ["will", 0.022222222222222223], ["street", 0.022222222222222223], ["night", 0.022222222222222223], ["kurt", 0.022222222222222223], ["spend", 0.022222222222222223], ["luck", 0.022222222222222223]], "sentiment": ["Dear Knox\u2014\nHere\u2019s the check for the books.\nI hope you and Kitty will go see my play again as my guest.
