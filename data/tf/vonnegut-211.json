Chins were raised, and eyes were widened, and nostrils were flared. There was no outcry, for the crowd wanted to hear absolutely everything that Rumfoord and the Space Wanderer might have to say.\n\"A victim of a series of accidents, were you?\" said Rumfoord up in his treetop. \"Of all the accidents,\" he said, \"which would you consider the most significant?\"\nThe Space Wanderer cocked his head. \"I\u2019d have to think\u2014\" he said.\n\"I\u2019ll spare you the trouble,\" said Rumfoord. \"The most significant accident that happened to you was your being born. Would you like me to tell you what you were named when you were born?\"\nThe Space Wanderer hesitated only a moment, and all that made him hesitate was a fear that he was going to spoil a very gratifying ceremonial career by saying the wrong thing. \"Please do,\" he said.\n\"They called you Malachi Constant,\" said Rumfoord up in his treetop.\nTo the extent that crowds can be good things, the crowds that Winston Niles Rumfoord attracted to Newport were good crowds. They were not crowd-minded. The members remained in possession of their own consciences, and Rumfoord never invited them to participate as one in any action\u2014least of all in applause or catcalls.\nWhen the fact had sunk in that the Space Wanderer was the disgusting, irking, and hateful Malachi Constant, the members of the crowd reacted in quiet, sighing, personal ways\u2014ways that were by and large compassionate. It was on their generally decent consciences, after all, that they had hanged Constant in effigy in their homes and places of work. And, while they had been cheerful enough about hanging the effigies, very few felt that Constant, in the flesh, actually deserved hanging. Hanging Malachi Constant in effigy was an act of violence on the order of trimming a Christmas tree or hiding Easter eggs.\nAnd Rumfoord up in his treetop said nothing to discourage their compassion. \"You have had the singular accident, Mr. Constant,\" he said sympathetically, \"of becoming a central symbol of wrong-headedness for a perfectly enormous religious sect.\n\"You would not be attractive to us as a symbol, Mr. Constant,\" he said, \"if our hearts did not go out to you to a certain extent.

It was common for him not to be paid at all. His real name, by the way, was Louis-Ferdinand Auguste Destouches.\nHis sympathy may not have lain with the poor and powerless, but he surely gave them the bulk of his time and astonishment. And he did not insult them with the idea that death was somehow ennobling to anybody\u2014or killing, either.\nHe and Ernest Hemingway died on the same day, incidentally, on July 1, 1961. Both were heroes from World War I. Both deserved Nobel prizes\u2014C\u00e9line for his first book alone. C\u00e9line didn\u2019t get one, and Hemingway did. Hemingway killed himself, and C\u00e9line died of natural causes.\nAll that remains is their books.\nAnd C\u00e9line\u2019s slowly fading infamy.\nAfter years of unselfish and often brilliant service to mankind in literature and medicine, he revealed himself as a fierce anti-Semite and a Nazi sympathizer. This was in the late 1930s. I have heard no explanation for this, other than that he was partly insane. He never claimed to have been insane, and no physician ever declared Him so.\nHe was sane enough, at any rate, to virtually exclude his racism and cracked politics from his novels. The anti-Semitism appears only flickeringly here and there, and usually in a context of his being absolutely gaga about all the varieties of treacherous and foolish human beings.\nFor what it may be worth, he wrote these words only a few days before he died: \u201cI say that Israel is a real fatherland that welcomes its children home and my country is a shit-house \u2026\u201d\nHis words are contemptible to anyone who has suffered from anti-Semitism. And so, surely, were the amnesty and exoneration he received from the French government in 1951. He was punished with heavy fines and imprisonment and exile before that.\nAs for the words I quoted: They don\u2019t, after all, imply an apology or a wish to be forgiven.

Book sales are booming. People are suffocated by the scandal, which grinds on week after week, and they are using books, apparently, as ways of coming up for air. Nobody is entertained or enlightened by Watergate. It\u2019s torture, not show business.\nYou want my honest reaction to your book. I don\u2019t think it is better than the others. It is simply bigger and flashier than the others, and so will attract more attention and perhaps lead to greater financial success. You were a master when I first met you, and masters do not grow. They simply work. So you will never get any news of your having grown from me. Growth is for apprentices. I welcome anything you do. Just now, I would especially welcome your poetry. Personally, I prefer your smaller works, just as I prefer smaller Vermeers. But that way lies destitution, I fear.\nI\u2019m sorry that you are tired of living such a lonely life, but I will bet you that you can\u2019t do a damn thing about it without changing your profession. I have met a lot of writers by now, and they all carry twenty acres of Sahara Desert with them wherever they go. I have no idea what the explanation for this is, other than the necessary smallness of their organizations.\nMaybe I will come to Chile, but not before I learn to speak Spanish.
