"sentiment": ["DOCTOR PAUL PROTEUS had been his own man, alone in his own house for a week. He\u2019d been expecting some sort of communication from Anita, but nothing came. There was nothing more, he realized wonderingly, to be said. She was still at the Mainland, probably. The Meadows session had another week to run. After that would come the muddle of her separating her effects from his\u2014and divorce. He wondered on what grounds she would divorce him. Extreme mental cruelty amused him, and he supposed it was close enough to the truth. Any variation from any norm pained her terribly. She\u2019d have to leave New York State, of course, since the only grounds for divorce there were adultery, and incitement to conspire to advocate sabotage. A case could be made for either, he supposed, but not with dignity.\nPaul had gone to his farm once, and, in the manner of a man dedicating his life to God, he\u2019d asked Mr. Haycox to put him to work, guiding the hand of Nature. The hand he grasped so fervently, he soon discovered, was coarse and sluggish, hot and wet and smelly. And the charming little cottage he\u2019d taken as a symbol of the good life of a farmer was as irrelevant as a statue of Venus at the gate of a sewage-disposal plant. He hadn\u2019t gone back.\nHe\u2019d been to the Works once. The machinery had been shut off during the Meadows session, and only the guards were on duty. Four of them, now officious and scornful, had telephoned to Kroner at the Meadows for instructions. Then they\u2019d escorted him to what had been his desk, where he\u2019d picked up a few personal effects. They\u2019d made a list of what he\u2019d taken, and questioned his claim to each item. Then they\u2019d marched him back into the outside world, and shut the gates against him forever and ever.\nPaul was in the kitchen now, before the laundry console, seated on a stool, watching television. It was late afternoon, and, for the unadorned hell of it, he was doing his own laundry.\n\u201cUrdle-urdle-urdle,\u201d went the console. \u201cUrdle-urdle-ur dull! Znick. Bazz-wap!\u201d Chimes sounded. \u201cAzzzzzzzzzz. Fromp!\u201d Up came the anticlimactic offering: three pairs of socks, three pairs of shorts, and the blue Meadow\u2019s T-shirts, which he was using for pajamas.\nOn the television screen, a middle-aged woman was counseling her teen-age son, whose hair and clothes were disordered and soiled.\n\u201cFightin\u2019 don\u2019t help, Jimmy,\u201d she was saying sadly. \u201cLord knows nobody ever brought any more sunshine into the world by bloodyin\u2019 somebody\u2019s nose, or by havin\u2019 his own nose bloodied.\u201d\n\u201cI know\u2014but he said my I.Q. was 59, Ma!\u201d The boy was on the point of tears, he was so furious and hurt. \u201cAnd he said Pop was a 53!\u201d\n\u201cNow, now\u2014that\u2019s just child\u2019s talk. Don\u2019t you pay it no mind, Jimmy.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s true,\u201d said the boy brokenly. \u201cMa, it\u2019s true. I went down to the police station and looked it up! Fifty-nine, Ma! and poor Pop with a 53.\u201d He turned his back, and his voice was a bitter whisper: \u201cAnd you with a 47, Ma.

Its front windows looked out into the perpetual damp twilight of a huge front porch. Its side windows looked into the neighbors\u2019 windows ten feet away. Light could reach the interior only through a window in the back. As luck would have it, the window let light into a tiny pantry.\nThe boy and his father and his mother did not hear the reporters knocking. The television set in the living room and the radio in the kitchen were both on, blatting away, and the family was having a row in the dining room, halfway between them.\nThe row was actually about everything in creation, but it had for its subject of the moment the boy\u2019s mustache. He had been growing it for a month and had just been caught by his father in the act of blacking it with shoe polish.\nThe boy\u2019s name was Rice Brentner. It was true, as the papers said, that Rice had spent time in reform school. That was three years behind him now His crime had been, at the age of thirteen, the theft of sixteen automobiles within a period of a week. Except for the escapade with Annie, he hadn\u2019t been in any real trouble since.\n\u201cYou march into the bathroom,\u201d said his mother, \u201cand you shave that awful thing off.\u201d\nRice did not march. He stayed right where he was.\n\u201cYou heard your mother,\u201d his father said. When Rice still didn\u2019t budge, his father tried to hurt him with scorn. \u201cMakes him feel like a man, I guess\u2014like a great big man,\u201d he said.", 0.041899585921325054], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
