pornography through the public library.\u201d\n** Rev. George Zarris, chairman of Moral Majority in Illinois, has openly encouraged the removal and burning of \u201cunfit\u201d library books. Because of community pressure, State Senator Jeremiah Joyce has introduced a bill into the Illinois General Assembly that would make librarians liable for prosecution for distributing \u201charmful\u201d material to minors.\n** The Island Trees, N.Y. school board removed nine books from high school libraries, including my own Slaughterhouse-Five and Bernard Malamud\u2019s The Fixer. The ACLU successfully appealed a lower court\u2019s decision upholding the removal but the case will still be reviewed by the Supreme Court.\n** A Vermont school district\u2019s ban on Dog Day Afternoon and The Wanderers was upheld by a federal court last October.\nI am offended as a citizen, as a writer, and as an ACLU member that certain elements are trying to drag us backward to the darker days of censorship.\nThe freedom to choose or reject ideas, to read books of our choice, and to publish freely is the very bedrock of our free society. The First Amendment is a prohibition of governmental interference with free speech.\nI support the ACLU for many reasons but none as critical and important as its never-ending vigilance for free speech.\nCases of textbook and library censorship have been reported so rapidly in the past few months that the ACLU is physically and financially unable to cope with the legal burden. This is personally distressing to me because the ACLU is the only organization effectively fighting the censors.\nI have never written a letter asking anyone to help a cause. Because I feel so strongly about what is happening in our country today and because I know the tremendous financial burden being placed on the ACLU, I have decided to do what I can to fight this ugly and dangerous trend.\nI ask you to join with me in giving a special gift to the ACLU at this critical time in history, when those on the other side are raising millions.", 0.1038972431077694], "title": "Letters"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["stores", 0.030303030303030304], ["chain", 0.030303030303030304], ["bokonon", 0.030303030303030304], ["book", 0.030303030303030304], ["play", 0.030303030303030304], ["midget", 0.030303030303030304], ["utopias", 0.020202020202020204], ["pipes", 0.020202020202020204], ["republic", 0.020202020202020204], ["hope", 0.020202020202020204], ["mercy", 0.020202020202020204], ["drug", 0.020202020202020204], ["soft", 0.020202020202020204], ["called", 0.020202020202020204], ["struts", 0.010101010101010102], ["begun", 0.010101010101010102], ["cried", 0.010101010101010102], ["chosen", 0.010101010101010102], ["raged", 0.010101010101010102], ["julian", 0.010101010101010102], ["national", 0.010101010101010102], ["son", 0.010101010101010102], ["foot", 0.010101010101010102], ["individual", 0.010101010101010102], ["ghastly", 0.010101010101010102], ["picked", 0.010101010101010102], ["mouthpiece", 0.010101010101010102], ["gas", 0.010101010101010102], ["chambers", 0.010101010101010102], ["clarinet", 0.010101010101010102], ["thinks", 0.010101010101010102], ["subject", 0.010101010101010102], ["constitution", 0.010101010101010102], ["bastard", 0.010101010101010102], ["stocks", 0.010101010101010102], ["acts", 0.010101010101010102], ["area", 0.010101010101010102], ["angela", 0.010101010101010102], ["ruins", 0.010101010101010102], ["write", 0.010101010101010102], ["religion", 0.010101010101010102], ["written", 0.010101010101010102], ["died", 0.010101010101010102], ["house", 0.010101010101010102], ["set", 0.010101010101010102], ["contaminated", 0.010101010101010102], ["start", 0.010101010101010102], ["poor", 0.010101010101010102], ["praised", 0.010101010101010102], ["thaw", 0.010101010101010102], ["huskily", 0.010101010101010102], ["rules", 0.010101010101010102], ["big", 0.010101010101010102], ["concerning", 0.010101010101010102], ["seventh", 0.010101010101010102], ["tornadoes", 0.010101010101010102], ["hand", 0.010101010101010102], ["depressing", 0.010101010101010102], ["game", 0.010101010101010102], ["ice", 0.010101010101010102], ["126", 0.010101010101010102], ["hopes", 0.010101010101010102], ["magnificence", 0.010101010101010102], ["aphorisms", 0.010101010101010102], ["meaningful", 0.010101010101010102], ["heroic", 0.010101010101010102], ["man", 0.010101010101010102], ["directed", 0.010101010101010102], ["grocery", 0.010101010101010102], ["spoke", 0.010101010101010102], ["winks", 0.010101010101010102], ["changed", 0.010101010101010102], ["conversation", 0.010101010101010102], ["murmured", 0.010101010101010102], ["jungle", 0.010101010101010102], ["jigaboo", 0.010101010101010102], ["die", 0.010101010101010102], ["bolivar", 0.010101010101010102], ["castle", 0.010101010101010102]], "sentiment": ["Midget, midget, midget, how he struts and winks,\nFor he knows a man\u2019s as big as what he hopes and thinks!\n126\nSOFT PIPES, PLAY ON\n\u201cSUCH A DEPRESSING RELIGION!\u201d I cried.
