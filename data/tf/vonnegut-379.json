My father and mother and grandparents wrote expressively and beguilingly simply because they were civilized.\nIf you want to write fiction, then you must be patient, for you need experiences, and those take time to accumulate. Unfortunately, television offers the illusion of experiences writers used to come by the hard way, in courtrooms, on ships, in hospitals, whatever. Please don\u2019t rely on those, unless you want to be popular.\nI say go for truths, very personal ones, not likely to be learned from TV sets. We need to know what those are. Or I do.\nThe secret of universality is provincialism. Don\u2019t open a window and make love to the world. Literary masterpieces since the birth of the novel and short story have all been obsessed with narrow societies, Emma Bovary\u2019s, Leopold Bloom\u2019s, about which most readers cannot be expected to know much.
