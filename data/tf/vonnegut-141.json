Walter F. Starbuck finally did.\nI seemed to hold up quite well when I was arrested in the showroom of The American Harp Company. When old Delmar Peale showed the two policemen the circular about the stolen clarinet parts, when he explained what I was to be arrested for, I even smiled. I had the perfect alibi, after all: I had been in prison for the past two years.\nWhen I told them that, though, it did not relax them as much as I had hoped. They decided that I was perhaps more of a desperado than they had at first supposed.\nThe police station was in an uproar when we arrived. Television crews and newspaper reporters were trying to get at the young men who had rioted in the gardens of the United Nations, who had thrown the finance minister of Sri Lanka into the East River. The Sri Lankan had not been found yet, so it was assumed that the rioters would be charged with murder.\nActually, the Sri Lankan would be rescued by a police launch about two hours later. He would be found clinging to a bell buoy off Governor\u2019s Island. The papers the next morning would describe him as \u201cincoherent.\u201d I can believe it.\nThere was no one to question me at once. I was going to have to be locked up for a while. The police station was so busy that there wasn\u2019t even an ordinary cell for me. I was given a chair in the corridor outside the cells. It was there that the rioters insulted me from behind bars, imagining that I would enjoy nothing so much as making love to them.\nI was eventually taken to a padded cell in the basement. It was designed to hold a maniac until an ambulance could come for her or him. There wasn\u2019t a toilet in there, because a maniac might try to bash his or her brains out on a toilet\u2019s rim. There was no cot, no chair. I would have to sit or lie on the padded floor. Oddly enough, the only piece of furniture was a large bowling trophy, which somebody had stored in there. I got to know it well.\nSo there I was back in a quiet basement again.\nAnd, as had happened to me when I was the President\u2019s special advisor on youth affairs, I was forgotten again.", 0.13289241622574957], "title": "Jailbird"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["salo", 0.04878048780487805], ["moncrief", 0.03048780487804878], ["martian", 0.03048780487804878], ["ship", 0.03048780487804878], ["plans", 0.024390243902439025], ["ships", 0.018292682926829267], ["space", 0.018292682926829267], ["crippled", 0.018292682926829267], ["rumfoord", 0.018292682926829267], ["mars", 0.018292682926829267], ["uwtb", 0.018292682926829267], ["components", 0.018292682926829267], ["suicide", 0.012195121951219513], ["technological", 0.012195121951219513], ["agents", 0.012195121951219513], ["people", 0.012195121951219513], ["service", 0.012195121951219513], ["secret", 0.012195121951219513], ["manufacturers", 0.012195121951219513], ["malicious", 0.006097560975609756], ["money", 0.006097560975609756], ["years", 0.006097560975609756], ["ended", 0.006097560975609756], ["questions", 0.006097560975609756], ["gladly", 0.006097560975609756], ["mansion", 0.006097560975609756], ["earth", 0.006097560975609756], ["fine", 0.006097560975609756], ["assembled", 0.006097560975609756], ["source", 0.006097560975609756], ["weeks", 0.006097560975609756], ["good", 0.006097560975609756], ["generously", 0.006097560975609756], ["descendants", 0.006097560975609756], ["rise", 0.006097560975609756], ["half", 0.006097560975609756], ["condition", 0.006097560975609756], ["earl", 0.006097560975609756], ["profound", 0.006097560975609756], ["newport", 0.006097560975609756], ["plain", 0.006097560975609756], ["small", 0.006097560975609756], ["financial", 0.006097560975609756], ["grateful", 0.006097560975609756], ["energy", 0.006097560975609756], ["titan", 0.006097560975609756], ["idea", 0.006097560975609756], ["modified", 0.006097560975609756], ["measure", 0.006097560975609756], ["machines", 0.006097560975609756], ["planet", 0.006097560975609756], ["termites", 0.006097560975609756], ["civilization", 0.006097560975609756], ["messenger", 0.006097560975609756], ["cloud", 0.006097560975609756], ["millions", 0.006097560975609756], ["recruits", 0.006097560975609756], ["power", 0.006097560975609756], ["understanding", 0.006097560975609756], ["broken", 0.006097560975609756], ["depots", 0.006097560975609756], ["ades", 0.006097560975609756], ["iron", 0.006097560975609756], ["asked", 0.006097560975609756], ["features", 0.006097560975609756], ["supply", 0.006097560975609756], ["powerful", 0.006097560975609756], ["system", 0.006097560975609756], ["marvelous", 0.006097560975609756], ["donated", 0.006097560975609756], ["engineer", 0.006097560975609756], ["city", 0.006097560975609756], ["brute", 0.006097560975609756], ["discontended", 0.006097560975609756], ["tralfamadore", 0.006097560975609756], ["conceivable", 0.006097560975609756], ["prototype", 0.006097560975609756], ["war", 0.006097560975609756], ["friend", 0.006097560975609756], ["possession", 0.006097560975609756], ["life", 0.006097560975609756], ["clever", 0.006097560975609756], ["shuttling", 0.006097560975609756], ["butler", 0.006097560975609756], ["solar", 0.006097560975609756], ["magellanic", 0.006097560975609756], ["organizations", 0.006097560975609756], ["earthling", 0.006097560975609756], ["work", 0.006097560975609756], ["cash", 0.006097560975609756], ["bed", 0.006097560975609756], ["will", 0.006097560975609756], ["phoebe", 0.006097560975609756], ["servants", 0.006097560975609756], ["making", 0.006097560975609756], ["sills", 0.006097560975609756], ["stripped", 0.006097560975609756], ["universal", 0.006097560975609756], ["lived", 0.006097560975609756], ["walks", 0.006097560975609756], ["orders", 0.006097560975609756], ["built", 0.006097560975609756], ["person", 0.006097560975609756], ["responsible", 0.006097560975609756], ["luxury", 0.006097560975609756], ["draw", 0.006097560975609756], ["servile", 0.006097560975609756], ["established", 0.006097560975609756], ["knew", 0.006097560975609756], ["triumphs", 0.006097560975609756], ["fa", 0.006097560975609756], ["opportunity", 0.006097560975609756], ["died", 0.006097560975609756], ["chiefly", 0.006097560975609756], ["age", 0.006097560975609756], ["order", 0.006097560975609756], ["procurement", 0.006097560975609756], ["charged", 0.006097560975609756], ["wing", 0.006097560975609756], ["profits", 0.006097560975609756], ["quantity", 0.006097560975609756]], "sentiment": ["Moncrief died of old age in his bed in the servants\u2019 wing of the Rumfoord mansion two weeks after the war ended.\nThe person chiefly responsible for the technological triumphs of the Martian suicide was Salo, Rumfoord\u2019s friend on Titan. Salo was a messenger from the planet Tralfamadore in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Salo had technological know-how from a civilization that was millions of Earthling years old. Salo had a space ship that was crippled\u2014but, even in its crippled condition, it was by far the most marvelous space ship that the Solar System had ever seen. His crippled ship, stripped of luxury features, was the prototype of all the ships of Mars. While Salo himself was not a very good engineer, he was none the less able to measure every part of his ship, and to draw up the plans for its Martian descendants.\nMost important of all\u2014Salo had in his possession a quantity of the most powerful conceivable source of energy, UWTB, or the Universal Will to Become. Salo generously donated half of his supply of UWTB to the suicide of Mars.\nEarl Moncrief, the butler, built his financial, procurement, and secret service organizations with the brute power of cash and a profound understanding of clever, malicious, discontended people who lived behind servile fa\u00e7ades.\nIt was such people who took the Martian money and the Martian orders gladly. They asked no questions. They were grateful for the opportunity to work like termites on the sills of the established order.\nThey came from all walks of life.\nThe modified plans of Salo\u2019s space ship were broken down into plans for components.

The Biafrans had nothing to eat, you\u2019ll remember. They were blockaded, so no food got in. They had almost nothing to fight with, except for some Mauser rifles which were a good deal older than I was. And still they fought on. They had no recruiting program. There was no governmental scheme for the relief of refugees, and none was needed. The government did nothing to look out for the old, the sick, either. Biafra, for the short time it lasted, could be admired simultaneously by both anarchists and conservatives.\n\u201cThe people could look out for each other, without any help from the central government, because every Biafran was a member of an extended family. He had hundreds of relatives he knew by name and reputation. Some Biafrans had thousands of relatives or more.\n\u201cThose families took care of their own wounded, their own lunatics, their own refugees. They shared equally whatever they had. The government didn\u2019t have to send a policeman to make sure the food was divided fairly. When the government needed new soldiers, it told each family how many recruits it was expected to send. The family decided then who was to go.\n\u201cAnd this admirable scheme was far from being an invention by the Biafrans. They were simply continuing to live as most human beings have lived until recently.\n\u201cI have seen the past, and it works.\n\u201cWe should return to extended families as quickly as we can, and be lonesome no more, lonesome no more.\n\u201cSome of you will become leaders, although that is now thought to be a grungy destiny. Nobody wants to be Papa anymore. If you do have to lead, you may imagine that your mission is to help us find an amazing future. You should consider the possibility that you could serve the people better if you were to lead them intelligently and imaginatively back to some of the more humane and comforting institutions of the past.\n\u201cIt seems certain that you will face plenty of social unrest in the future, and demands will continue to be made for economic justice. You will be very shrewd leaders indeed if you recognize that the people are in fact crying out not so much for money as for relief from loneliness.\n\u201cLet me beguile you just a little bit more about extended families. Let us talk about divorce, and the fact that one out of every three of us here has been or will be divorced. When we do it, we will very likely wrangle and wail and weep formlessly about money and sex, about treachery, about outgrowing one another, about how close love is to hate, and so on.

If it was a robber, I would try to get out the back door and hide among the weeds and garbage cans. He or she would have to help himself or herself. I would not be there to obey his or her orders to cooperate.\nThe customer, or whatever it was, was inspecting dark glasses on a carousel.

I don\u2019t think it is a very useful enterprise. Vance appears to have handled you foolishly, boorishly, maybe, but he has a point. Are you willing to pander to popular tastes in order to be published? If so, write about a love affair. It isn\u2019t so terrible to write for the women\u2019s magazines. That is how I supported myself more or less for about twelve years. I do not feel dishonored. What the hell. You\u2019d be surprised what you can say in a woman\u2019s magazine these days.\nAnd I\u2019ve taken jobs a damned sight worse than writing for Hallmark. Most people have. But you really want to make it as big as Muhammad Ali, don\u2019t you\u2014to be that popular and wise in a magically simple way? I\u2019d like to help. And you want to be a satirist, too\u2014or to write really strong stuff, anyway. Women don\u2019t customarily handle oil paints well, you know\u2014or black and white. I don\u2019t know if you have it in you to be crude. I write with a big black crayon, you know, grasped in a grubby, kindergarten fist. You\u2019re more of an impressionist. If you want to kind of try what I do, take life seriously but none of the people in it. The people are fools, and I say so the instant they\u2019re onstage. I don\u2019t let them prove it slowly. The author is very much around, and he is opinionated. Women are usually much too subtle and polite to intrude like that.\nAgain: write a love story, and it will be a good love story, and it will sell. That\u2019s life.

"sentiment": ["Billy wanted to laugh. The magazine, which was published for lonesome men to jerk off to, ran the story so it could print pictures taken from blue movies which Montana had made as a teen-ager. Billy did not look closely at these. They were grainy things, soot and chalk. They could have been anybody.\nBilly was again directed to the back of the store, and he went this time. A jaded sailor stepped away from a movie machine while the film was still running. Billy looked in, and there was Montana Wildhack alone on a bed, peeling a banana. The picture clicked off. Billy did not want to see what happened next, and a clerk importuned him to come over and see some really hot stuff they kept under the counter for connoisseurs.\nBilly was mildly curious as to what could possibly have been kept hidden in such a place. The clerk leered and showed him. It was a photograph of a woman and a Shetland pony. They were attempting to have sexual intercourse between two Doric columns, in front of velvet draperies which were fringed with deedlee-balls.\nBilly didn\u2019t get onto television in New York that night, but he did get onto a radio talk show. There was a radio station right next to Billy\u2019s hotel. He saw its call letters over the entrance of an office building, so he went in. He went up to the studio on an automatic elevator, and there were other people up there, waiting to go in. They were literary critics, and they thought Billy was one, too. They were going to discuss whether the novel was dead or not. So it goes.\nBilly took his seat with the others around a golden oak table, with a microphone all his own. The master of ceremonies asked him his name and what paper he was from. Billy said he was from the Ilium Gazette.\nHe was nervous and happy. \u201cIf you\u2019re ever in Cody, Wyoming,\u201d he told himself, \u201cjust ask for Wild Bob.\u201d\nBilly put his hand up at the very first part of the program, but he wasn\u2019t called on right away. Others got in ahead of him. One of them said that it would be a nice time to bury the novel, now that a Virginian, one hundred years after Appomattox, had written Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. Another one said that people couldn\u2019t read well enough anymore to turn print into exciting situations in their skulls, so that authors had to do what Norman Mailer did, which was to perform in public what he had written. The master of ceremonies asked people to say what they thought the function of the novel might be in modern society, and one critic said, \u201cTo provide touches of color in rooms with all-white walls.\u201d Another one said, \u201cTo describe blow-jobs artistically.\u201d Another one said, \u201cTo teach wives of junior executives what to buy next and how to act in a French restaurant.\u201d\nAnd then Billy was allowed to speak. Off he went, in that beautifully trained voice of his, telling about the flying saucers and Montana Wildhack and so on.\nHe was gently expelled from the studio during a commercial.

This mornin\u2019?\u201d\nWayne shyly acknowledged that this was true. So Eldon took him through a kitchen to a long table where the kitchen staff ate. There was a television setback there, and it was on, and it showed Wayne the beheading of Queen Mary of Scotland. Everybody was all dressed up, and Queen Mary put her head on the block of her own accord.\nEldon arranged for Wayne to get a free steak and mashed potatoes and gravy and anything else he wanted, all prepared by other black men in the kitchen. There was a bowl of Arts Festival buttons on the table, and Eldon made Wayne put one on before he ate. \u201cWear this at all times\u201d he told Wayne gravely, \u201cand no harm can come to you.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nEldon revealed to Wayne a peephole, which kitchen workers had drilled through the wall and into the cocktail lounge. \u201cWhen you get tarred of watchin\u2019 television,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can watch the animals in the zoo.\u201d\nEldon himself had a look through the peephole, told Wayne that there was a man seated at the piano bar who had been paid fifty thousand dollars for sticking a piece of yellow tape to a green piece of canvas.
