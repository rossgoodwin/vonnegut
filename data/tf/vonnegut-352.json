And of that rest of the world nothing had seemed more firm than the union of Baer, the engineering genius, and Kroner, the rock of faith in technology. \u201cHe isn\u2019t dead, is he?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Kroner sadly, \u201cno, he\u2019s still alive\u2014physically, that is.\u201d He placed a microphone on a table and moved up a chair, so that Paul might testify in comfort. \u201cWell, who knows\u2014maybe what happened is just as well.

Now, you come over here, Paul, my boy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Baer?\u201d insisted Paul.\n\u201cOh,\u201d sighed Kroner, \u201che read that fool letter, cleaned out his desk drawers, and walked out. Sit right here, Paul.\u201d\nThe letter, then, had been that good, Paul thought, astonished at the upheaval it had caused in at least one man\u2019s life. But then he wondered if the letter hadn\u2019t won Baer\u2019s support by default of the opposition rather than by its being unanswerable. If someone with quicker wits than Kroner\u2019s had been at hand to argue against the letter, perhaps Baer would still have been on the job in Albany. \u201cWhat was the official reaction to the letter?\u201d asked Paul.\n\u201cClassified as top secret,\u201d said Kroner, \u201cso anybody trying to circulate it will come under the National Security Act. So don\u2019t worry, my boy, it isn\u2019t going any farther.\u201d\n\u201cThere is going to be an official reply, isn\u2019t there?\u201d said Paul.\n\u201cThat\u2019d be playing right into their hands, wouldn\u2019t it\u2014acknowledging publicly that this Ghost Shirt nonsense is worth the notice of the system? That\u2019s exactly what they want to have happen! Come on, now, sit down, and let\u2019s get this over with, so you can get home and have a well-earned rest.\u201d\nAbsently, Paul sat down before the microphone, and Kroner switched on the recorder. The official reaction to the Ghost Shirt Society was the official response to so many things: to ignore it, as pressing and complicated matters were ignored in the annual passion plays at the Meadows. It was as though the giving or withholding of official recognition were life or death to ideas. And there was the old Meadows team spirit in the reaction, too, the spirit that was supposed to hold the system together: the notion that the opposition wanted nothing but to win and humiliate, that the object of competition was total victory, with mortifying defeat the only alternative imaginable.", 0.09053406084656083], "title": "Player Piano"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["vonnegut", 0.03571428571428571], ["kurt", 0.03571428571428571], ["william", 0.026785714285714284], ["rodney", 0.026785714285714284], ["allen", 0.026785714285714284], ["jazz", 0.017857142857142856], ["understanding", 0.017857142857142856], ["spoke", 0.017857142857142856], ["faculty", 0.017857142857142856], ["english", 0.017857142857142856], ["comedians", 0.008928571428571428], ["style", 0.008928571428571428], ["27", 0.008928571428571428], ["louise", 0.008928571428571428], ["writing", 0.008928571428571428], ["include", 0.008928571428571428], ["friendly", 0.008928571428571428], ["happened", 0.008928571428571428], ["meant", 0.008928571428571428], ["1991", 0.008928571428571428], ["conversations", 0.008928571428571428], ["realize", 0.008928571428571428], ["moody", 0.008928571428571428], ["school", 0.008928571428571428], ["january", 0.008928571428571428], ["university", 0.008928571428571428], ["eve", 0.008928571428571428], ["morning", 0.008928571428571428], ["anxious", 0.008928571428571428], ["audience", 0.008928571428571428], ["quick", 0.008928571428571428], ["works", 0.008928571428571428], ["people", 0.008928571428571428], ["idea", 0.008928571428571428], ["books", 0.008928571428571428], ["dear", 0.008928571428571428], ["subject", 0.008928571428571428], ["mood", 0.008928571428571428], ["witnessed", 0.008928571428571428], ["seriously", 0.008928571428571428], ["math", 0.008928571428571428], ["told", 0.008928571428571428], ["city", 0.008928571428571428], ["attention", 0.008928571428571428], ["exhibitionism", 0.008928571428571428], ["york", 0.008928571428571428], ["liddy", 0.008928571428571428], ["seventy", 0.008928571428571428], ["change", 0.008928571428571428], ["wait", 0.008928571428571428], ["kids", 0.008928571428571428], ["hostile", 0.008928571428571428], ["davenport", 0.008928571428571428], ["invited", 0.008928571428571428], ["months", 0.008928571428571428], ["nightclub", 0.008928571428571428], ["gordon", 0.008928571428571428], ["asked", 0.008928571428571428], ["superbowl", 0.008928571428571428], ["nevelson", 0.008928571428571428], ["comic", 0.008928571428571428], ["timothy", 0.008928571428571428], ["arts", 0.008928571428571428], ["question", 0.008928571428571428], ["long", 0.008928571428571428], ["response", 0.008928571428571428], ["startled", 0.008928571428571428], ["louisiana", 0.008928571428571428], ["relationship", 0.008928571428571428], ["musician", 0.008928571428571428], ["hold", 0.008928571428571428], ["sculptor", 0.008928571428571428], ["leary", 0.008928571428571428], ["intuitive", 0.008928571428571428], ["science", 0.008928571428571428], ["piece", 0.008928571428571428], ["treated", 0.008928571428571428], ["crazy", 0.008928571428571428], ["grown", 0.008928571428571428], ["author", 0.008928571428571428], ["reminded", 0.008928571428571428], ["stayed", 0.008928571428571428], ["member", 0.008928571428571428], ["book", 0.008928571428571428], ["department", 0.008928571428571428], ["critics", 0.008928571428571428], ["yesterday", 0.008928571428571428], ["cheers", 0.008928571428571428], ["arrived", 0.008928571428571428], ["class", 0.008928571428571428], ["ago", 0.008928571428571428], ["lower", 0.008928571428571428], ["introduced", 0.008928571428571428], ["pennsylvania", 0.008928571428571428], ["professor", 0.008928571428571428]], "sentiment": ["In response to your question about the relationship of my style to jazz and comedians: I don\u2019t think about it much, but, now that you\u2019ve asked, it seems right to say that my writing is of a piece with the nightclub exhibitionism you witnessed in Davenport, lower class, intuitive, moody, and anxious to hold the attention of a potentially hostile audience, and quick (like a comic or a jazz musician) to change the subject or mood.

His books include Understanding Kurt Vonnegut and Conversations with Kurt Vonnegut.\nDear William Rodney Allen\u2014\nUnderstanding Kurt Vonnegut arrived here yesterday morning (Superbowl Eve). It is such a friendly book. I had no idea it was in the works. I spoke at the University of Pennsylvania a few months ago, and was startled to be introduced by a member of the English department. That had never happened before. He spoke so well of me! I had grown used to being treated by faculty as though I were a crazy invited by the kids, like Timothy Leary or G. Gordon Liddy. Faculty stayed away.\nI was reminded of the sculptor Louise Nevelson, who told me that she had to wait until she was seventy before critics would take her seriously. \u201cIt took that long for people to realize that I really meant it,\u201d she said.", 0.010612426788897384], "title": "Letters"}}
