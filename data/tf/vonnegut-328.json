We tend to like each other. We\u2019re both primitives, it seems to me, Grandma Moses of the intellect. He came to hear me lecture at M.I.T. a couple of years ago, and we had supper afterwards. I was scared shitless of what he might say about Galapagos, and didn\u2019t ask his opinion. But he dropped me a note, saying it was pretty good science, and that the fur-covered human mutant is fairly common.\nI just finished reading a Ph.D. thesis by a guy your age named William Keough. It\u2019s about violence in American humor, and he examines Twain, Bierce, Lardner, and myself. The others wound up in despair over human nature, he says, and implies that I can scarcely do otherwise. One possible escape route is open to me, however, which was not evident to the other three. That is the extraordinarily important idea (I only now understand) which I picked up from Anthropology: culture is a gadget which can be tinkered with like a Model-T Ford. Our President supposes that his brain is producing his opinions. His brain in fact is soaked in a culture, and has never bothered to examine its ingredients. He oozes rather than thinks.
