NOEL STURGEON\nNoel Sturgeon was the third child and second daughter of Theodore and Marion Sturgeon and the trustee of Theodore\u2019s literary estate. She had written Vonnegut to ask if he would write an introduction to a new edition of her father\u2019s short stories. She said that many readers were curious about the relationship between Vonnegut\u2019s character Kilgore Trout, the science-fiction writer, and her father, a well-known and highly regarded science-fiction writer.\nDear Ms. Sturgeon\u2014\nI created a character Kilgore Trout, an impoverished, uncelebrated science-fiction writer, who made his debut in 1965, in my novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. Trout would subsequently make cameo appearances in several more of my books, and in 1973 would star in Breakfast of Champions.\nPersons alert for word-play noticed that Trout and Theodore Sturgeon were both named for fish, and that their first names ended with \u201core.\u201d They asked me if my friend Ted had been my model for Kilgore.\nAnswer: Very briefly, and in a way. Kilgore, like Ted when we first met in 1958, was a victim of a hate crime then commonly practiced by the American literary establishment. It wasn\u2019t racism or sexism or ageism. It was \u201cgenreism.\u201d Definition: \u201cThe unexamined conviction that anyone who wrote science-fiction wasn\u2019t really a writer, but rather a geek of some sort.\u201d A genuine geek, of course, is a carnival employee who is displayed in a filthy cage and billed as \u201cThe Wild Man from Borneo.\u201d\nGenreism was still rampant in late autumn, 1958, when I was living in Barnstable, on Cape Cod, and Ted and his wife Marion had just rented a house near the water in Truro\u2014no place to be when winter came. We knew each other\u2019s work, but had never met. Bingo! There we were face-to-face at last, at suppertime in my living room.\nTed had been writing non-stop for days or maybe weeks. He was skinny and haggard, underpaid and unappreciated outside the ghetto science-fiction was then. He announced that he was going to do a standing back flip, which he did. He landed on his knees with a crash which shook the whole house. When he got back on his feet, humiliated and laughing in agony, one of the best writers in America was indeed, but only for a moment, my model for Kilgore Trout.\nRespectfully yours\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut", 0.06504132231404959], "title": "Letters"}}
