City\nTO GEORGE STRONG\nGeorge Strong was one of the other American P.O.W.s who, like Vonnegut, survived the firebombing of Dresden.\nDear George Strong\u2014\nI\u2019m home again, to the extent that anybody\u2019s really got a home anymore. Maybe my fundamental home is in Dresden, since that is where my great adventure took place, and where one hundred of us selected at random were bonded by tremendous violence into a brotherhood\u2014and then dispersed to hell and gone. Your seeking me out and greeting me like a brother was a profoundly important event for me. So I thank you for that.\nYou, it turns out, are our meticulous historian, so I enclose some documents which may be of interest to you. I thought when I published Slaughterhouse-Five so long ago that I would hear from everybody who had been there with us. I only heard from three: Bill Burns, who is in broadcasting in Cincinnati, \u201cFrenchy\u201d LeClaire, an admittedly alcoholic house painter in New Hampshire, who died mainly of booze about fifteen years ago, and Dick Coyle, a contented high school English teacher and football coach in Ohio, who has a bad cancer in remission. He still goes to work, and says, \u201cYou play the cards they deal you.\u201d My closest buddy in I&R, 2nd Bn. Hq., 423rd Inf. Rgt., B.V. O\u2019Hare, I never lost touch with. As I told you, he is a hot shot criminal lawyer, a former D.A., and can be reached at 1431 Easton Road, Heller-town, Pa. 18015. He smokes even worse than I do, and has had a throat operation, but is still in active practice. I\u2019m ashamed to say that I don\u2019t have addresses for the rest. This is an intolerably sloppy office I run, with me as the only employee.\nIn the last chapter of what may be my last book, Bluebeard, I describe the valley we came to after we walked away from the schoolhouse at Hellendorf. Six of us appropriated a Wehrmacht horse and wagon, and traveled around for several days unimpeded by anyone. We made it back to the slaughterhouse, I\u2019m not sure why, and were arrested by Russians, who locked us up in the barracks of what used to be a training camp for Army Engineers. That was outside Meissen, I think. Then we were taken in Model A trucks to the Elbe at Halle, and traded one-for-one for subjects of the U.S.S.R. held by the Americans on the other side. Many of these, including Gypsies and Ukrainian turncoats, I heard later, were shot or hanged almost immediately. What fun!\nI enclose the original of a letter from Robert G. Allen, 1212 56th Street, Des Moines, Iowa, 50311, since it is hard enough to read without being a Xerox. The names he lists mean nothing to me, but may ring bells with you. Guys I wish I could see again: Bob Lehr, Bob Kelton, Jim Donnini, Richard E. Davis. They are as silent as the tomb. Mike Pallaia (spelling?) and Joe Crone (Billy Pilgrim) died in Dresden, of course. And the nice Italian kid I mentioned, whose name I\u2019ve forgotten, was accidentally shot by an Italian who had just found a loaded Luger in a ditch. So what are we up to: maybe fifteen per cent now accounted for?\nFraternally yours,\nKurt Vonnegut", 0.030573347107438028], "title": "Letters"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["water",

thing on top of the house to keep the weather out is the ruff, and the stream in back of the house is the crick.\nEvery race and subrace and blend thereof is native to the Middle West. I myself am a purebred Kraut. Our accents are by no means uniform. My twang is only fairly typical of European-Americans raised some distance north of the former Confederate States of America. It appeared to me when I began this essay that I was on a fool\u2019s errand, that we could be described en masse only as what we weren\u2019t. We weren\u2019t Texans or Brooklynites or Californians or Southerners, and so on.\nTo demonstrate to myself the folly of distinguishing us, one by one, from Americans born anywhere else, I imagined a crowd on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where I am living now, and another crowd on State Street in Chicago, where I went to a university and worked as a reporter half a century ago. I was not mistaken about the sameness of the faces and clothing and apparent moods.\nBut the more I pondered the people of Chicago, the more aware I became of an enormous presence there. It was almost like music, music unheard in New York or Boston or San Francisco or New Orleans.\nIt was Lake Michigan, an ocean of pure water, the most precious substance in all this world.\nNowhere else in the Northern Hemisphere are there tremendous bodies of pure water like our Great Lakes, save for Asia, where there is only Lake Baikal. So there is something distinctive about native Middle Westerners, after all. Get this: When we were born, there had to have been incredible quantities of fresh water all around us, in lakes and streams and rivers and raindrops and snowdrifts, and no undrinkable salt water anywhere!\nEven my taste buds are Middle Western on that account. When I swim in the Atlantic or the Pacific, the water tastes all wrong to me, even though it is in fact no more nauseating, as long as you don\u2019t swallow it, than chicken soup.\nThere were also millions and millions of acres of topsoil around us and our mothers when we were born, as flat as pool tables and as rich as chocolate cake. The Middle West is not a desert.\nWhen I was born, in 1922, barely a hundred years after Indiana became the nineteenth state in the Union, the Middle West already boasted a constellation of cities with symphony orchestras and museums and libraries, and institutions of higher learning, and schools of music and art, reminiscent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the First World War. One could almost say that Chicago was our Vienna, Indianapolis our Prague, Cincinnati our Budapest, and Cleveland our Bucharest.\nTo grow up in such a city, as I did, was to find such cultural institutions as ordinary as police stations or firehouses. So it was reasonable for a young person to daydream of becoming some sort of artist or intellectual, if not a policeman or fireman. So I did.

Morty kicked the door shut, but not before Lou had glimpsed what was in his hand\u2014Gramps\u2019 enormous economy-size bottle of anti-gerasone, which had been half-emptied, and which Morty was refilling to the top with tap water.\nA moment later, Morty came out, glared defiantly at Lou, and brushed past him wordlessly to rejoin his pretty bride.\nShocked, Lou didn\u2019t know what on earth to do. He couldn\u2019t let Gramps take the mousetrapped anti-gerasone; but if he warned Gramps about it, Gramps would certainly make life in the apartment, which was merely insufferable now, harrowing.\nLou glanced into the living room, and saw that the Schwartzes, Emerald among them, were momentarily at rest, relishing the botches that McGarveys had made of their lives. Stealthily, he went into the bathroom, locked the door as well as he could, and began to pour the contents of Gramps\u2019 bottle down the drain. He was going to refill it with full-strength anti-gerasone from the twenty-two smaller bottles on the shelf. The bottle contained a half-gallon, and its neck was small, so it seemed to Lou that the emptying would take forever. And the almost imperceptible smell of anti-gerasone, like Worcestershire sauce, now seemed to Lou, in his nervousness, to be pouring out into the rest of the apartment through the keyhole and under the door.\n\"Gloog-gloog-gloog-gloog-,\" went the bottle monotonously. Suddenly, up came the sound of music from the living room, and there were murmurs and the scraping of chair legs on the floor. \"Thus ends,\" said the television announcer, \"the 29,121st chapter in the life of your neighbors and mine, the McGarveys.\" Footsteps were coming down the hall. There was a knock on the bathroom door.\n\"Just a sec,\" called Lou cheerily. Desperately, he shook the big bottle, trying to speed up the flow. His palms slipped on the wet glass, and the heavy bottle smashed to splinters on the tile floor.\nThe door sprung open, and Gramps, dumfounded, stared at the mess.\nLou grinned engagingly through his nausea, and, for want of anything remotely resembling a thought, he waited for Gramps to speak.\n\"Well, boy,\" said Gramps at last, \"looks like you\u2019ve got a little tidying up to do.\"", -0.05926162131519275], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
