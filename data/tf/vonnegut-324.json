This was in her home in Washington, D.C. She was comatose, and simply stopped breathing, with close friends and relatives at hand. She was cremated the next day, and had a really swell funeral on Sunday, the 21st. My brother and I were there, and all six of her children with their mates, and three of her five grandchildren. She was a devout Episcopalian at the end, but the rules of that religion were broken for her funeral, in that there were eulogies\u2014by her saintly husband Adam, and by three of her children, Mark, Nannie and Steve Adams.\nI thought you should know, since we were all so close in Chicago so many years ago.\nMuch love\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut\nP.S.

Luck.\" He shambled out into the corridor.\nThe nurse stuck her head into the waiting room. \"You can see your baby, Mr. Netman.\"\n\"Doctor\u2014\" said Heinz, hurrying out into the corridor, wanting to shake Powers\u2019 hand again so that Powers would know what a magnificent thing he\u2019d done. \"It\u2019s the most wonderful thing that ever happened.\" The elevator doors slithered shut between them before Dr. Powers could show a glimmer of response.\n\"This way,\" said the nurse. \"Turn left at the end of the hall, and you\u2019ll find the nursery window there. Write your name on a piece of paper and hold it against the glass.\"\nHeinz made the trip by himself, without seeing another human being until he reached the end. There, on the other side of a large glass panel, he saw a hundred of them cupped in shallow canvas buckets and arranged in a square block of straight ranks and files.\nHeinz wrote his name on the back of a laundry slip and pressed it to the window. A fat and placid nurse looked at the paper, not at Heinz\u2019s face, and missed seeing his wide smile, missed an urgent invitation to share for a moment his ecstasy.\nShe grasped one of the buckets and wheeled it before the window. She turned away again, once more missing the smile.\n\"Hello, hello, hello, little Knechtmann,\" said Heinz to the red prune on the other side of the glass. His voice echoed down the hard, bare corridor, and came back to him with embarrassing loudness. He blushed and lowered his voice. \"Little Peter, little Kroll,\" he said softly, \"little Friederich\u2014and there\u2019s Helga in you, too. Little spark of Knechtmann, you little treasure house. Everything is saved in you.\"", 0.060249433106575954], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
