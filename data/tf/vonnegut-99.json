That was the logical next step.\nAnd even in 1996, I in speeches propose the following amendments to the Constitution:\nArticle XXVIII: Every newborn shall be sincerely welcomed and cared for until maturity.\nArticle XXIX: Every adult who needs it shall be given meaningful work to do, at a living wage.\nWhat we have created instead, as customers and employees and investors, is mountains of paper wealth so enormous that a handful of people in charge of them can take millions and billions for themselves without hurting anyone.

His home is still in Ilium. He has had to cross three international boundaries in order to reach Chicago. The United States of America has been Balkanized, has been divided into twenty petty nations so that it will never again be a threat to world peace. Chicago has been hydrogen-bombed by angry Chinamen. So it goes. It is all brand new.\nBilly is speaking before a capacity audience in a baseball park, which is covered by a geodesic dome. The flag of the country is behind him. It is a Hereford bull on a field of green. Billy predicts his own death within an hour. He laughs about it, invites the crowd to laugh with him. \u201cIt is high time I was dead,\u201d he says. \u201cMany years ago,\u201d he said, \u201ca certain man promised to have me killed.

Two of Peru\u2019s fighter bombers were then over Ecuadorian territories, one with its rocket tuned to the radar signals coming from Guayaquil International Airport, and the other with its rocket tuned to radar signals coming from the naval base on the Gal\u00e1pagos Island of Baltra, lair of a sail training ship, six Coast Guard ships, two oceangoing tugs, a patrol submarine, a dry dock, and, high and dry in the dry dock, a destroyer. The destroyer was the largest ship in the Ecuadorian Navy, save for one\u2014the Bah\u00eda de Darwin.\nQuoth Mandarax:\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.\n\u2014CHARLES DICKENS (1812\u20131870)",

Running errands for Gregory, I became as cunning as a sewer rat about the fastest ways to get from anywhere to anywhere on the island of Manhattan. I quintupled my vocabulary, learning the names and functions of every important part of every sort of organism and artifact. My most thrilling accomplishment, however, was this: I finished a meticulously accurate painting of Gregory\u2019s studio in only six months! The bone was bone, the fur was fur, the hair was hair, the dust was dust, the soot was soot, the wool was wool, the cotton was cotton, the walnut was walnut, the oak was oak, the horsehide was horsehide, the cowhide was cowhide, the iron was iron, the steel was steel, the old was old and the new was new.\nYes, and the water dripping from the skylight in my painting was not only the wettest water you ever saw: in each droplet, if you looked at it through a magnifying glass, there was the whole damned studio! Not bad! Not bad!\nAn idea has just come to me from nowhere, to wit: Might not the ancient and nearly universal belief that sperm could be metabolized into noble actions have been the inspiration for Einstein\u2019s very similar formula: \u201cE equals MC squared\u201d?\n\u201cNot bad, not bad,\u201d said Dan Gregory of my painting, and I imagined his feeling like Robinson Crusoe on the occasion of Crusoe\u2019s understanding that he no longer had his little island all to himself. There was now me to reckon with.\nBut then he said, \u201cHowever, not bad is another term for disappointing or worse, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\nBefore I could frame a reply, he had put the picture atop the glowing coals in the fireplace with the skulls on its mantelpiece. Six months\u2019 painstaking work went up the flue in a moment.\nI managed to ask chokingly, perfectly aghast, \u201cWhat was the matter with it?\u201d\n\u201cNo soul,\u201d he said complacently.\nSo there I was in the thrall of the new Imperial engraver Beskudnikov!\nI knew what he was complaining about, and the complaint wasn\u2019t laughable, coming from him. His own pictures were vibrant with the full spectrum of his own loves, hates and neutralities, as dated as that spectrum might seem today. If I were to visit that private museum in Lubbock, Texas, where so many of his works are on permanent display, the pictures would create for me a sort of hologram of Dan Gregory. I could pass my hand through it, but it would be Dan Gregory in three dimensions all the same.

This is not a church filled with regrets.\n\u201cWhy not? We always treated Lavina with love and decency. Why did we do that? It was Lavina\u2019s particular genius to so behave that the only possible responses on our part were love and decency. That is her richest legacy to us, I think: Her lessons in how to treat others so that their only possible responses are, again, love and decency.\n\u201cThere is at least one person here who does not need to learn what Lavina knew. He is Lavina\u2019s spiritual equal, although he was so much in love with her that perhaps he never knew it. He is Ollie Morris Lyon.\n\u201cOllie and Lavina are country people, by the way.\n\u201cI have seen them achieve success and happiness in the ugly factory city of Schenectady, New York, where I first met them. They were not much older than Mary and Philip then. Think of that. Yes, and when they lived in New York City, they had as much fun as any jazz-age babies ever did. Good for them! But they were always a farmer and his wife.\n\u201cNow the farmer\u2019s wife has died. I\u2019m glad they got back here before she died.\n\u201cThe wife died first.\n\u201cIt happens all the time\u2014but it always seems like such a terrible violation of the natural order when the wife dies first. Is there anyone here, even a child, who did not believe that Lavina would survive us all? She was so healthy, so capable, so beautiful, so strong. She was supposed to come to our funerals\u2014not the other way around.\n\u201cWell\u2014she may come to them yet. She will, if she can. She will talk to God about it, I\u2019m sure. If anybody can stretch the rules of heaven a little, Lavina can.\n\u201cI say she was strong. We all say she was strong. Yes, and in this bicentennial springtime we can say that she was like a legendary pioneer woman in her seeming strengths.

He may not even have understood English. The newscaster spoke with a barking sort of hilarity, as though life were a comical steeplechase, with unconventional steeds and hazards and vehicles involved. He made me feel that even I was a contestant\u2014in a bathtub drawn by three aardvarks, perhaps. I had as good a chance as anybody to win.\nHe told about another man in the steeplechase, who had been sentenced to die in an electric chair in Texas. The doomed man had instructed his lawyers to fight anybody, including the governor and the President of the United States, who might want to grant him a stay of execution. The thing he wanted more than anything in life, evidently, was death in the electric chair.\nTwo joggers came down the path between me and the radio. They were a man and a woman in identical orange-and-gold sweatsuits and matching shoes. I already knew about the jogging craze. We had had many joggers in prison. I found them smug.\nAbout the young man and his radio. I decided that he had bought the thing as a prosthetic device, as an artificial enthusiasm for the planet. He paid as little attention to it as I paid to my false front tooth. I have since seen several young men like that in groups\u2014with their radios tuned to different stations, with their radios engaged in a spirited conversation. The young men themselves, perhaps having been told nothing but \u201cshut up\u201d all their lives, had nothing to say.\nBut now the young man\u2019s radio said something so horrifying that I got off my bench, left the park, and joined the throng of Free Enterprisers charging along Forty-second Street toward Fifth Avenue.\nThe story was this: An imbecilic young female drug addict from my home state of Ohio, about nineteen years old, had had a baby whose father was unknown. Social workers put her and the baby into a hotel not unlike the Arapahoe. She bought a full-grown German shepherd police dog for protection, but she forgot to feed it. Then she went out one night on some unspecified errand, and she left the dog to guard the baby. When she got back, she found that the dog had killed the baby and eaten part of it.\nWhat a time to be alive!\nSo there I was marching as purposefully as anybody toward Fifth Avenue. According to plan, I began to study the faces coming at me, looking for a familiar one that might be of some use to me. I was prepared to be patient. It would be like panning for gold, I thought, like looking for a glint of the precious in a dish of sand.\nWhen I had got no farther than the curb at Fifth Avenue, though, my warning systems went off ear-splittingly: \u201cBeep, beep, beep! Honk, honk, honk!
