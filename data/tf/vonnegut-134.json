He was as informal as he ever became, having replaced his double-breasted suit coat with a single-breasted one of a slightly lighter shade and with suede patches at the elbows. The coat, he explained to visitors, was something his wife had given him years ago, something which he\u2019d only recently mustered nerve enough to wear.\n\u201cI love your house more every time I see it,\u201d said Anita.\n\u201cYou must tell Janice that.\u201d Janice was Mrs. Kroner, who smiled sweetly from the living room. She was a fat repository of truisms, adages, and homilies, and was usually addressed by the young engineers and managers as \u201cMom.\u201d\nMom, Paul recalled, had never liked that Finnerty boy, who would never call her Mom nor confide in her. Once, after she\u2019d prodded him to unburden himself and feel better, he\u2019d rather testily told her that he\u2019d already fled one mother. Paul she liked, because Paul, as a youngster, had confided in her now and then. He would never do it again, but his demeanor before her conveyed that his failure to confide recently wasn\u2019t due to revulsion, but to a lack of problems.\n\u201cHello, Mom,\u201d said Paul.\n\u201cHello, Mom,\u201d said Anita.\n\u201cYou children take a load off your feet,\u201d said Mom. \u201cNow just tell me all about yourselves.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve redone the kitchen,\u201d said Anita.\nMom was thrilled, eager for details.\nKroner hung his huge head, as though listening intently to the small talk, or, more likely, Paul thought, counting away the seconds

Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony anyway.\u201d\nI say the same thing about the death of James Wait: \u201cOh, well\u2014he wasn\u2019t going to write Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony anyway.\u201d\nThis wry comment on how little most of us were likely to accomplish in life, no matter how long we lived, isn\u2019t my own invention. I first heard it spoken in Swedish at a funeral while I was still alive. The corpse at that particular rite of passage was an obtuse and unpopular shipyard foreman named Per Olaf Rosenquist. He had died young, or what was thought to be young in those days, because he, like James Wait, had inherited a defective heart. I went to the funeral with a fellow welder named Hjalmar Arvid Bostr\u00f6m, not that it can matter much what anybody\u2019s name was a million years ago. As we left the church, Bostr\u00f6m said to me: \u201cOh, well\u2014he wasn\u2019t going to write Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony anyway.\u201d\nI asked him if this black joke was original, and he said no, that he had heard it from his German grandfather, who had been an officer in charge of burying the dead on the Western Front during World War One. It was common for soldiers new to that sort of work to wax philosophical over this corpse or that one, into whose face he was about to shovel dirt, speculating about what he might have done if he hadn\u2019t died so young. There were many cynical things a veteran might say to such a thoughtful recruit, and one of those was: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. He wasn\u2019t going to write Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony anyway.\u201d\nAfter I myself was buried young in Malm\u00f6, only six meters from Per Olaf Rosenquist, Hjalmar Arvid Bostr\u00f6m said that about me, as he left the cemetery: \u201cOh, well\u2014Leon wasn\u2019t going to write Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony anyway.\u201d\nYes, and I was reminded of that comment when Captain von Kleist chided Mary for weeping about the death of the man they believed to be Willard Flemming.

In prison, though, you get to listening for things more and more. You stay there long enough, you go blind, you're all ears. The click is one thing you listen for. You two\u2014you think you're mighty close? If you were really close\u2014and that don't mean you have to like him, just know him\u2014you would have heard that click of his a mile away. You get to know a man, and down deep there's something bothering him bad, and maybe you never find out what it is, but it's what makes him do like he does, it's what makes him look like he's got secrets in his eyes. And you tell him, 'Calm down, calm down, take it easy now.' Or you ask him, 'How come you keep doing the same crazy things over and over again, when you know they're just going to get you in trouble again?' Only you know there's no sense arguing with him, on account of it's the thing inside that's making him go. It says, 'Jump,' he jumps. It says, 'Steal,' he steals. It says, 'Cry,' he cries. Unless he dies young, though, or unless he gets everything all his way and nothing big goes wrong, that thing inside of him is going to run down like a wind-up toy. You're working in the prison laundry next to this man. You've known him twenty years. You're working along, and all of a sudden you hear this click from him. You turn to look at him. He's stopped working. He's all calmed down. He looks real dumb. He looks real sweet. You look in his eyes, and the secrets are gone. He can't even tell you his own name right then. He goes back to work, but he'll never be the same. That thing that bothered him so will never click on again. It's dead, it's dead.

Both of his hands were white, choking the broomhandle in a deathgrip. And while the natural design of his story suggested that he calm down, to illustrate how nicely the man next to him in the laundry had calmed down, it was impossible for him to simulate peace. The wrenching work his hands did on the broomhandle became obscene, and the passion that would not die made him nearly inarticulate. \"Done! Done!\" he insisted. It was the broomhandle that enraged him most now. He tried to snap it across his thigh, snarled at Charley, the owner of the broom, \"The son of a bitch won't break! Won't break!\n\"You lucky bastard,\" he said to Eliot, still trying to break the broom, \"you've had yours!\" He showered Eliot with obscenities.\nHe flung the broom away. \"Motherfucker won't break!\" he cried, and he stormed out the door.\nEliot was unruffled by the scene. He asked Charley mildly what the man had against brooms. He said, too, that he guessed he had better catch his bus.\n\"Are\u2014are you all right, Eliot?\"\n\"I'm wonderful.\"\n\"You are?\"\n\"I never felt better in my life.

Expressionist paintings, which was the best in Europe, and second in the world only to mine.\nWhat is it about Armenians that they always do so well? There should be an investigation.\nHow did I come to possess Kim Bum Suk\u2019s invaluable doctoral thesis at precisely the moment I must write about my reunion with Marilee in 1950? We have here another coincidence, which superstitious persons would no doubt take seriously.\nTwo days ago, the widow Berman, made vivacious and supranaturally alert by God only knows what postwar pharmaceutical miracles, entered the bookstore in East Hampton, and heard, by her own account, one book out of hundreds calling out to her. It said that I would like it. So she bought it for me.\nShe had no way of knowing that I was on the brink of writing about Florence. Nobody did. She gave me the book without herself examining the contents, and so did not know that my old girlfriend\u2019s palazzo was therein described.\nOne would soon go mad if one took such coincidences too seriously. One might be led to suspect that there were all sorts of things going on in the Universe which he or she did not thoroughly understand.\nDr. Kim or Dr. Bum or Dr. Suk, whichever is the family name, if any, has cleared up two questions I had about the rotunda when I myself was privileged to see it. The first puzzle was how the dome was filled with natural light in the daytime. It turns out that there were mirrors on the sills of the clerestory windows\u2014and there were still more mirrors on the roofs outside to capture sunbeams and deflect them upward into the dome.\nThe second puzzle was this: why were the vast rectangles between the encircling columns at ground level blank? How could any art patron have left them bare? When I saw them, they were painted the palest rose-orange, not unlike the Sateen Dura-Luxe shade yclept \u201cMaui Eventide.\u201d\nDr. Kim or Dr. Bum or Dr. Suk explains that lightly clad pagan gods and goddesses used to cavort in these spaces, and that they were lost forever. They had not been merely concealed under coats of paint. They had been scraped off the walls during the exile of the Medicis from Florence from 1494, two years after the discovery of this hemisphere by white people, until 1531. The murals were destroyed by the insistence of the Dominican monk Girolamo Savonarola, who wished to dispel every trace of paganism, which he felt had poisoned the city during the reign of the Medicis.\nThe murals were the work of Giovanni Vitelli, about whom almost nothing else is known, except that he was said to have been born in Pisa. One may assume that he was the Rabo Karabekian of his time, and that Christian fundamentalism was his Sateen Dura-Luxe.", 0.11141975308641976], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["voices", 0.08536585365853659], ["rest", 0.036585365853658534], ["taunted", 0.036585365853658534], ["promise", 0.024390243902439025], ["reached", 0.024390243902439025], ["glockenspiel", 0.024390243902439025], ["began", 0.024390243902439025], ["piano", 0.024390243902439025], ["melodramatically", 0.024390243902439025], ["murmur", 0.024390243902439025], ["sixty", 0.024390243902439025], ["voice", 0.024390243902439025], ["chains", 0.024390243902439025], ["miracles", 0.012195121951219513], ["wordless", 0.012195121951219513], ["aspirations", 0.012195121951219513], ["soaring", 0.012195121951219513], ["higher", 0.012195121951219513], ["church", 0.012195121951219513], ["sounds", 0.012195121951219513], ["fanfare", 0.012195121951219513], ["breaking", 0.012195121951219513], ["speak", 0.012195121951219513], ["spoke", 0.012195121951219513], ["sweetly", 0.012195121951219513], ["pure", 0.012195121951219513], ["glee", 0.012195121951219513], ["overcoming", 0.012195121951219513], ["sunlight", 0.012195121951219513], ["heights", 0.012195121951219513], ["plateau", 0.012195121951219513], ["crying", 0.012195121951219513], ["grand", 0.012195121951219513], ["uppermost", 0.012195121951219513], ["wordlessly", 0.012195121951219513], ["low", 0.012195121951219513], ["unbelievable", 0.012195121951219513], ["stars", 0.012195121951219513], ["aspiring", 0.012195121951219513], ["club", 0.012195121951219513], ["rise", 0.012195121951219513], ["strained", 0.012195121951219513], ["stay", 0.012195121951219513], ["break", 0.012195121951219513], ["soprano", 0.012195121951219513], ["climbing", 0.012195121951219513], ["brasses", 0.012195121951219513], ["died", 0.012195121951219513], ["thread", 0.012195121951219513], ["limits", 0.012195121951219513], ["obstacles", 0.012195121951219513], ["miracle", 0.012195121951219513], ["sang", 0.012195121951219513], ["stunning", 0.012195121951219513], ["climbed", 0.012195121951219513], ["truth", 0.012195121951219513], ["bind", 0.012195121951219513], ["reluctantly", 0.012195121951219513], ["meeeeeeeeeeee", 0.012195121951219513], ["climb", 0.012195121951219513], ["bells", 0.012195121951219513], ["musical", 0.012195121951219513]], "sentiment": ["The seeming church bells and the fanfare died reluctantly.\nThe sixty voices of the glee club began to murmur sweetly, to murmur low.\nAnd then the sixty voices, crying out wordlessly, began to climb.

did not know that my great-grandfather had said such a thing, or even that he had written a book, until about ten days ago. My brother Bernard sent the book to me then, after picking it up on a recent trip to Indianapolis. Bernard also sent me a copy of Clemens Vonnegut\u2019s comments on life and death, which were read at his funeral. Clemens Vonnegut planned his own funeral in 1874, and actually died in 1906. His words to his mourners were these:\n\u201cFriends or Opponents: To all of you who stand here to deliver my body to the earth:\n\u201cTo you, my next of kin:\n\u201cDo not mourn! I have now arrived at the end of the course of life, as you will eventually arrive at yours. I am at rest and nothing will ever disturb my deep slumber.\n\u201cI am disturbed by no worries, no grief, no fears, no wishes, no passions, no pains, no reproaches from others. All is infinitely well with me.\n\u201cI departed from life with loving, affectionate feelings for all mankind; and I admonish you: Be aware of this truth that the people on this earth could be joyous, if only they would live rationally, and if they would contribute mutually to each others\u2019 welfare.\n\u201cThis world is not a vale of sorrows if you will recognize discriminatingly what is truly excellent in it; and if you will avail yourself of it for mutual happiness and well-being. Therefore, let us explain as often as possible, and particularly at the departure from life, that we base our faith on firm foundations, on Truth for putting into action our ideas which do not depend on fables and ideas which Science has long ago proven to be false.\n\u201cWe also wish Knowledge, Goodness, Sympathy, Mercy, Wisdom, Justice, and Truthfulness. We also strive for and venerate all of those attributes from which the fantasy of man has created a God. We also strive for the virtues of Temperance, Industriousness, Friendship, and Peace. We believe in pure ideas based on Truth and Justice.\n\u201cTherefore, however, we do not believe, cannot believe, that a Thinking Being existed for millions and millions of years, and eventually and finally out of nothing\u2014through a Word\u2014created this world, or rather this earth with its Firmament, its Sun and Moon and the Stars.\n\u201cWe cannot believe that this Being formed a human being from clay and breathed into it an Immortal Soul, and then allowed this human being to procreate millions, and then delivered them all into unspeakable misery, wretchedness and pain for all eternity. Nor can we believe that the descendants of one or two human beings will inevitably become sinners; nor do we believe that through the criminal executions of an Innocent One may we be redeemed.\u201d",

Townies the night before. I got out of the Mercedes and realized that I had to urinate. But I didn\u2019t want to do it in my own house. I didn\u2019t want to talk to the crazy people in there. How is that for excitement? What germ ever lived a life so rich in challenges and opportunities?\nAt least nobody was shooting at me, and I wasn\u2019t wanted by the police.\nSo I went into the tall weeds of a vacant lot across the street from and below my house, which was built on a slope. I whipped out my ding-dong and found it was aimed down at a beautiful white Italian racing bicycle lying on its side. The bicycle was so full of magic and innocence, hiding there. It might have been a unicorn.\nAfter urinating elsewhere, I set that perfect artificial animal upright. It was brand-new. It had a seat like a banana. Why had somebody thrown it away? To this day I do not know. Despite our enormous brains and jam-packed libraries, we germ hotels cannot expect to understand absolutely everything. My guess is that some kid from a poor family in the town below came across it while skulking around the campus. He assumed, as would I, that it belonged to some Tarkington student who was superrich, who probably had an expensive car and more beautiful clothes than he could ever wear. So he took it, as would I when my turn came. But he lost his nerve, as I would not, and hid it in the weeds rather than face arrest for grand larceny.\nAs I would soon find out the hard way, the bike actually belonged to a poor person, a teenage boy who worked in the stable after school, who had scrimped and saved until he could afford to buy as splendid a bicycle as had ever been seen on the campus of Tarkington.\nTO PLAY WITH my mistaken scenario of the bike\u2019s belonging to a rich kid: It seemed possible to me that some rich kid had so many expensive playthings that he couldn\u2019t be bothered with taking care of this one. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t fit into the trunk of his Ferrari Gran Turismo. You wouldn\u2019t believe all the treasures, diamond earrings, Rolex watches, and on and on, that wound up unclaimed in the college\u2019s Lost and Found.\nDo I resent rich people? No. The best or worst I can do is notice them. I agree with the great Socialist writer George Orwell, who felt that rich people were poor people with money. I would discover this to be the majority opinion in the prison across the lake as well, although nobody over there had ever heard of George Orwell. Many of the inmates themselves had been poor people with money before they were caught, with the most costly cars and jewelry and watches and clothes. Many, as teenage drug dealers, had no doubt owned bicycles as desirable as the one I found in the weeds in the highlands of Scipio.\nWhen convicts found out that my car was nothing but a 4-door, 6-cylinder Mercedes, they often scorned or pitied me. It was the same with many of the students at Tarkington. I might as well have owned a battered pickup truck.\nSO I WALKED that bicycle out of the weeds and onto the steep slope of Clinton Street. I wouldn\u2019t have to pedal or turn a corner in order to deliver myself to the front door of the Black Cat Caf\u00e9. I would have to use the brakes, however, and I tested those. If the brakes didn\u2019t work, I would go off the end of the dock of the old barge terminal and, alley-oop, straight into Lake Mohiga.\nI straddled the banana-shaped saddle, which turned out to be surprisingly considerate of my sensitive crotch and hindquarters. Sailing down a hill on that bicycle in the sunshine wasn\u2019t anything like being crucified.", 0.1587777777777778], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["mother",

"sentiment": ["Father\u2019s deathbed scene went like this: Mother and Felix and I were there, right by his bed. Gino and Marco Mar\u00edtimo, faithful to the end, had driven to the hospital atop their own bulldozer. It would later turn out that these two endearing old poops had done hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of damage on the way, tearing up hidden automobiles and fences and fire hydrants and mailboxes, and so on. They had to stay out in the corridor, since they weren\u2019t blood relatives.\nFather was under an oxygen tent. He was all shot up with antibiotics, but his body couldn\u2019t fight off the pneumonia. Too much else was wrong. The hospital had shaved off his thick, youthful hair and mustache, so that an accidental spark couldn\u2019t make them burn like gunpowder in the presence of all that oxygen. He seemed to be asleep, but having nightmares, fighting with his eyes closed, when Felix and I came in.\nMother had already been there for hours. Her frostbitten hands and feet were enclosed in plastic bags filled with a yellow salve, so that she couldn\u2019t touch any of us. This turned out to be an experimental treatment for frostbite, invented right there in Midland City that very morning, by a Doctor Miles Pendleton. We assumed that all frostbite victims had their damaged parts encased in plastic and salve. Mother, in fact, was probably the only person in history to be treated that way.\nShe was a human guinea pig, and we didn\u2019t even know it.\nNo harm done, luckily.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFather\u2019s peephole closed forever at sunset on the day after the opening and closing of my play. He was sixty-eight. The only word Felix and I heard from him was his very last one, which was this: \u201cMama.\u201d It was Mother who told us about his earlier deathbed assertions\u2014that he had at least been good with children, that he had always tried to behave honorably, and that he hoped he had at least brought some appreciation of beauty to Midland City, even if he himself hadn\u2019t been an artist.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe mentioned guns, according to Mother, but he didn\u2019t editorialize about them. All he said was, \u201cGuns.\u201d\nThe wrecked guns, including the fatal Springfield, had been donated to a scrap drive during the war\u2014along with the weather vane.

I found him standing at the head of a long corridor, the far end of which was packed with sandbags. Pinned to the sandbags was a target in the shape of a man.\nThe target was a caricature of a cigar-smoking Jew. The Jew was standing on broken crosses and little naked women. In one hand the Jew held a bag of money labeled \u201cInternational Banking.\u201d In the other hand he held a Russian flag. From the pockets of his suit, little fathers, mothers, and children in scale with the naked women under his feet, cried out for mercy.\nAll these details were not evident from the far end of the shooting gallery, but it wasn\u2019t necessary for me to approach the target in order to know about them.\nI had drawn the target in about 1941.\nMillions of copies of the target were run off in Germany. It had so delighted my superiors that I was given a bonus of a ten-pound ham, thirty gallons of gasoline, and a week\u2019s all-expenses-paid vacation for my wife and myself at the Schreiberhaus in Riesenge-birge.\nI must admit that this target represents an excess of zeal, since I was not working as a graphic artist for the Nazis.

This letter is in response to Scholes sending Vonnegut a copy of his book The Fabulators, which discussed the work of John Barth, John Hawkes, Iris Murdoch, and Lawrence Durrell as well as Vonnegut. It was the first recognition and praise that Kurt had received from a recognized literary critic.\nScholes wrote that \u201cVonnegut, in his fiction, is doing what the most serious writers always do. He is helping, in Joyce\u2019s phrase, \u2018to create the conscience of the race.\u2019 What race? Human certainly, not American or German or any other abstraction from humanity. Just as pure romance provides us with necessary psychic exercise, intellectual comedy like Vonnegut\u2019s offers us moral stimulation\u2014not fixed ethical positions which we can complacently assume, but such thoughts as exercise our consciences and help us keep our humanity in shape, ready to respond to the humanity of others.\u201d\nWhen Kurt jokingly said he was \u201cburned up that Barth won,\u201d he was not referring to an award but to Scholes ranking Barth \u201cat the top of the fabulators in the book,\u201d Scholes told me.\nThe critic whom Kurt referred to as \u201cDavid\u201d was David Hayman, one of Scholes\u2019s colleagues at Iowa at the time and a Joyce scholar.\nDear Bob:\nI am groping now for the word that means a person who has traveled widely and speaks several languages.

If you hadn\u2019t supplied an index which pinpointed every mention of me, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to put it down until I\u2019d read it all.

He kept silent until the lights went out at night, and then, when there had been a long period of silence containing nothing to echo, he said to Rumfoord, \u201cI was in Dresden when it was bombed. I was a prisoner of war.\u201d\nRumfoord sighed impatiently.\n\u201cWord of honor,\u201d said Billy Pilgrim. \u201cDo you believe me?\u201d\n\u201cMust we talk about it now?\u201d said Rumfoord.

Billy and five other American prisoners were riding in a coffin-shaped green wagon, which they had found abandoned, complete with two horses, in a suburb of Dresden. Now they were being drawn by the clop-clop-clopping horses down narrow lanes which had been cleared through the moonlike ruins. They were going back to the slaughterhouse for souvenirs of the war. Billy was reminded of the sounds of milkmen\u2019s horses early in the morning in Ilium, when he was a boy.\nBilly sat in the back of the jiggling coffin. His head was tilted back and his nostrils were flaring. He was happy. He was warm. There was food in the wagon, and wine\u2014and a camera, and a stamp collection, and a stuffed owl, and a mantel clock that ran on changes of barometric pressure. The Americans had gone into empty houses in the suburb where they had been imprisoned, and they had taken these and many other things.\nThe owners, hearing that the Russians were coming, killing and robbing and raping and burning, had fled.\nBut the Russians hadn\u2019t come yet, even two days after the war. It was peaceful in the ruins. Billy saw only one other person on the way to the slaughterhouse. It was an old man pushing a baby buggy.
