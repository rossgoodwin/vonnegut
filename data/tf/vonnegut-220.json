There is plenty of oxygen to breathe.\nThe atmosphere of Titan is like the atmosphere outside the back door of an Earthling bakery on a spring morning.\nTitan has a natural chemical furnace at its core that maintains a uniform air temperature of sixty-seven degrees Fahrenheit.\nThere are three seas on Titan, each the size of Earthling Lake Michigan. The waters of all three are fresh and emerald clear. The names of the three are the Winston Sea, the Niles Sea, and the Rumfoord Sea.\nThere is a cluster of ninety-three ponds and lakes, incipiently a fourth sea. The cluster is known as the Kazak Pools.\nConnecting the Winston Sea, the Niles Sea, the Rumfoord Sea and the Kazak Pools are three great rivers. These rivers, with their tributaries, are moody\u2014variously roaring, listless, and torn. Their moods are determined by the wildly fluctuating tugs of eight fellow moons, and by the prodigious influence of Saturn, which has ninety-five times the mass of Earth. The three rivers are known as the Winston River, the Niles River, and the Rumfoord River.\nThere are woods and meadows and mountains.\nThe tallest mountain is Mount Rumfoord, which is nine thousand, five hundred and seventy-one feet high.\nTitan affords an incomparable view of the most appallingly beautiful things in the Solar System, the rings of Saturn. These dazzling bands are forty thousand miles across and scarcely thicker than a razor blade.\nOn Titan the rings are called Rumfoord\u2019s Rainbow.", 0.29000000000000004], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["man", 0.125], ["bokononists", 0.0625], ["guesses", 0.0625], ["hook", 0.0625], ["god", 0.0625], ["frank", 0.0625], ["rode", 0.0625], ["ocean", 0.0625], ["thing", 0.0625], ["sacred", 0.0625], ["sun", 0.0625], ["castle", 0.0625], ["95", 0.0625], ["asked", 0.0625], ["silence", 0.0625]], "sentiment": ["We rode in silence.\n\u201cWhat is sacred to Bokononists?\u201d I asked after a while.\n\u201cNot even God, as near as I can tell.\u201d\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\n\u201cJust one thing.\u201d\nI made some guesses. \u201cThe ocean?

It is the first deeply personal letter to be received at this new address. You should know that this house is one more cozy family outpost\u2014like Jamaica and Cape Cod. You are loved and welcome here.\nIt\u2019s an old house on a quiet street. Across the street is E.B. White\u2019s house, where David Halberstam now lives and writes. I now inhabit my major investment, as do you. I honestly think that it is a shrewd investment\u2014the best I could make at this time.
