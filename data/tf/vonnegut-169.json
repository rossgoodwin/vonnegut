My field of operation is usually within about twenty-five miles of my home, which is in North Crawford, New Hampshire.\nThe Hyannis Port thing happened because somebody misunderstood something I said, and thought I was an ardent Goldwater Republican. Actually, I hadn\u2019t made up my mind one way or the other about Goldwater.\nWhat happened was this: The program chairman of the North Crawford Lions Club was a Goldwater man, and he had this college boy named Robert Taft Rumfoord come talk to a meeting one day about the Democratic mess in Washington and Hyannis Port. The boy was national president of some kind of student organization that was trying to get the country back to what he called First Principles. One of the First Principles, I remember, was getting rid of the income tax. You should have heard the applause.\nI got a funny feeling that the boy didn\u2019t care much more about politics than I did. He had circles under his eyes, and he looked as though he\u2019d just as soon be somewhere else. He would say strong things, but they came out sounding like music on a kazoo. The only time he got really interesting was when he told about being in sailboat races and golf and tennis matches with different Kennedys and their friends. He said that there was a lot of propaganda around about what a fine golfer Bobby Kennedy was, whereas Bobby actually couldn\u2019t golf for sour apples. He said Pierre Salinger was one of the worst golfers in the world, and didn\u2019t care for sailing or tennis at all.\nRobert Taft Rumfoord\u2019s parents were there to hear him. They had come all the way from Hyannis Port. They were both very proud of him\u2014or at least the father was. The father had on white flannel trousers and white shoes, even though there was snow on the ground, and a double-breasted blue coat with brass buttons. The boy introduced him as Commodore William Rumfoord. The Commodore was a short man with very shaggy eyebrows, and pale blue eyes. He looked like a gruff, friendly teddy-bear, and so did his son. I found out later, from a Secret Service man, that the Kennedys sometimes called the Rumfoords \"the Pooh people,\" on account of they were so much like the bear in the children\u2019s book Winnie the Pooh.\nThe Commodore\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t a Pooh person, though. She was thin and quick, and maybe two inches taller than the Commodore. Bears have a way of looking as though they\u2019re pretty much satisfied with everything. The Commodore\u2019s lady didn\u2019t have that look. I could tell she was jumpy about a lot of things.\nAfter the boy was through pouring fire and brimstone on the Kennedys, with his father applauding everything he said, Hay Boyden, the building mover, stood up. He was a Kennedy Democrat, and he said some terrible things to the boy. The only one I remember is the first thing he said: \"Son, if you keep blowing off steam like this during your Boy Scout days, you aren\u2019t going to have an ounce of pressure left when you\u2019re old enough to vote.\" It got worse from there on.\nThe boy didn\u2019t get mad. He just got embarrassed, and answered back with some more kazoo music. It was the Commodore who really cared. He turned the color of tomato juice. He stood up and he argued back, did it pretty well, even though his wife was pulling at the bottom of his brass-buttoned coat the whole time. She was trying to get him to stop raising such an uproar, but the Commodore loved the uproar.\nThe meeting broke up with practically everybody embarrassed, and I went over to Hay Boyden to talk to him about something that didn\u2019t have anything to do with Kennedy or Goldwater. It was about a bathtub enclosure I had sold him. He had insisted on installing it himself, saving himself about seven dollars and a half. Only it leaked, and his dining-room ceiling fell down, and Hay claimed that was the fault of the merchandise and not the installation. Hay had some poison left in his system from his argument with the boy, so he used it up on me. I answered him back with the truth, and walked away from him, and Commodore Rumfoord grabbed my hand and shook it. He thought I\u2019d been defending his boy and Barry Goldwater.\n\"What business you in?\" he asked me.", 0.05064611633577153], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["pictures", 0.030612244897959183], ["sheetrock", 0.030612244897959183], ["years", 0.02040816326530612], ["dorothy", 0.02040816326530612], ["rabo", 0.02040816326530612], ["cut", 0.02040816326530612], ["paint", 0.02040816326530612], ["house", 0.02040816326530612], ["slazinger", 0.02040816326530612], ["draw", 0.02040816326530612], ["hungarian", 0.02040816326530612], ["felt", 0.02040816326530612], ["rhapsody", 0.02040816326530612], ["roller", 0.02040816326530612], ["reserve", 0.02040816326530612], ["karabekian", 0.02040816326530612], ["slathering", 0.01020408163265306], ["greenish", 0.01020408163265306], ["square", 0.01020408163265306], ["begged", 0.01020408163265306], ["drunk", 0.01020408163265306], ["absolutely", 0.01020408163265306], ["portraits", 0.01020408163265306], ["village", 0.01020408163265306], ["mind", 0.01020408163265306], ["primed", 0.01020408163265306], ["dura", 0.01020408163265306], ["feet", 0.01020408163265306], ["set", 0.01020408163265306], ["stretched", 0.01020408163265306], ["falling", 0.01020408163265306], ["close", 0.01020408163265306], ["children", 0.01020408163265306], ["barn", 0.01020408163265306], ["luxe", 0.01020408163265306], ["living", 0.01020408163265306], ["canvas", 0.01020408163265306], ["paintings", 0.01020408163265306], ["sentence", 0.01020408163265306], ["father", 0.01020408163265306], ["young", 0.01020408163265306], ["stayed", 0.01020408163265306], ["teacher", 0.01020408163265306], ["note", 0.01020408163265306], ["massacre", 0.01020408163265306], ["pollock", 0.01020408163265306], ["orange", 0.01020408163265306], ["weeks", 0.01020408163265306], ["apart", 0.01020408163265306], ["sateen", 0.01020408163265306], ["empty", 0.01020408163265306], ["happened", 0.01020408163265306], ["picture", 0.01020408163265306], ["finish", 0.01020408163265306], ["painted", 0.01020408163265306], ["big", 0.01020408163265306], ["couple", 0.01020408163265306], ["watch", 0.01020408163265306], ["story", 0.01020408163265306], ["lay", 0.01020408163265306], ["half", 0.01020408163265306], ["awful", 0.01020408163265306], ["provided", 0.01020408163265306], ["burnt", 0.01020408163265306], ["killed", 0.01020408163265306], ["kitchen", 0.01020408163265306], ["bedroom", 0.01020408163265306], ["forever", 0.01020408163265306], ["squares", 0.01020408163265306], ["wondered", 0.01020408163265306], ["wife", 0.01020408163265306], ["coat", 0.01020408163265306], ["potato", 0.01020408163265306], ["holes", 0.01020408163265306], ["stopped", 0.01020408163265306], ["afternoon", 0.01020408163265306], ["shade", 0.01020408163265306], ["berman", 0.01020408163265306], ["feeling", 0.01020408163265306], ["called", 0.01020408163265306]], "sentiment": ["\u201cSo what happened to the portraits?\u201d she said. \u201cWere they painted over?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cThey stayed there on the Sheetrock for six years.

It is perhaps a letter written by my youngest daughter Nanette. It is so organic! She wrote it to \u201cMr. X,\u201d an irascible customer at a Cape Cod restaurant where she worked as a waitress in the summer of 1978. The customer was so mad about the service he had received one evening, you see, that he had complained in writing to the management. The management posted the letter on the kitchen bulletin board.\nNanette\u2019s reply went like this:\nDear Mr. X,\nAs a newly trained waitress I feel that I must respond to the letter of complaint which you recently wrote to the ABC Inn. Your letter has caused more suffering to an innocent young woman this summer than the inconvenience you experienced in not receiving your soup on time and having your bread taken away prematurely and so on.\nI believe that you did in fact receive poor service from this new waitress. I recall her as being very flustered and upset that evening, but she hoped that her errors, clumsy as they were, would be understood sympathetically as inexperience. I myself have made mistakes in serving. Fortunately, the customers were humorous and compassionate. I have learned so much from these mistakes, and through the support and understanding of other waitresses and customers in the span of only one week, that I feel confident now about what I am doing, and seldom make mistakes.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Katharine is on her way to becoming a competent waitress. You must understand that learning how to waitress is very much the same as learning how to juggle. It is difficult to find the correct balance and timing. Once these are found, though, waitressing becomes a solid and unshakable skill.\nThere must be room for error even in such a finely tuned establishment as the ABC Inn. There must be allowance for waitresses being human. Maybe you did not realize that in naming this young woman you made it necessary for the management to fire her.
