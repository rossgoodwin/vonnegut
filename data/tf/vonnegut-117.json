this time.\nDaniel Boorstin was a lawyer and university professor at the University of Chicago. His 1961 book The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America popularized the term \u201cpseudo-event\u201d\u2014an event whose main purpose was to serve the goals of advertising and public relations.\nMurray Krieger was a literary critic whose 1960 book The Tragic Vision: Variations on a Theme in Literary Interpretation helped establish him as a leading literary critic and theorist.\nWayne Booth was another influential literary critic on the basis of his 1961 book The Rhetoric of Fiction. He was also dean of the undergraduate school of the University of Chicago and a professor at the university.\nHarper & Row reprinted Mother Night in hardcover in 1966.\nDear Paul:\nI was pleased to have the nice clipping from England. I hadn\u2019t seen it. It reached me yesterday, which was incidentally my 43rd birthday. Yesterday was also the day on which Vance asked me if I would like to come back for a second year. I said yes. Yesterday was also the day on which I played host to my editor at Harper & Row, Roger Klein. Roger made courtesy visits to Starbuck, Justice, Algren, and Bourjaily, and was very taken by my best student, Ian MacMillan. He promised to do his best to get Harper\u2019s Magazine to publish something of Ian\u2019s. You ask me to tell you of any good students in my care. Well, speaking conservatively, Ian is one of the three best writers I ever met. I\u2019m going to see if I can\u2019t make money start coming out of his ears within the next six months.\nAnd I have two others who are somewhat shallow and derivative, but funny and shrewd\u2014Berman and Lehrman. They could probably both make it in Hollywood.\nMy son Mark telephoned me (yesterday, again) from Swarthmore College to tell me that the Quakers aren\u2019t inclined to do much for the living, swinging arts. He wants to come out here to live with me and study film. I\u2019m going to make him stay there at least two years, to get the square academic foundation the school is justly proud of providing. My daughter Edith is already out here, finding the University High School a paradise. My wife was out here last week, but had to go back to nurse her dotty mother, who is recovering from a broken hip in our house on the Cape. She will be out here with me for the whole of the second semester.", 0.18482893450635388], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["movie", 0.03361344537815126], ["real", 0.025210084033613446], ["clumpity", 0.025210084033613446], ["greatest", 0.025210084033613446], ["going", 0.01680672268907563], ["fax", 0.01680672268907563], ["half", 0.01680672268907563], ["people", 0.01680672268907563], ["brother", 0.01680672268907563], ["second", 0.01680672268907563], ["drew", 0.01680672268907563], ["jill", 0.01680672268907563], ["block", 0.01680672268907563], ["buy", 0.01680672268907563], ["will", 0.01680672268907563], ["floor", 0.01680672268907563], ["third", 0.01680672268907563], ["nancy", 0.01680672268907563], ["detective", 0.008403361344537815], ["casablanca", 0.008403361344537815], ["office", 0.008403361344537815], ["rest", 0.008403361344537815], ["brain", 0.008403361344537815], ["parked", 0.008403361344537815], ["avenue", 0.008403361344537815], ["hounds", 0.008403361344537815], ["choose", 0.008403361344537815], ["easy", 0.008403361344537815], ["stationery", 0.008403361344537815], ["mail", 0.008403361344537815], ["good", 0.008403361344537815], ["foreigners", 0.008403361344537815], ["katharine", 0.008403361344537815], ["eve", 0.008403361344537815], ["house", 0.008403361344537815], ["computer", 0.008403361344537815], ["star", 0.008403361344537815], ["girl", 0.008403361344537815], ["peter", 0.008403361344537815], ["thinks", 0.008403361344537815], ["best", 0.008403361344537815], ["closet", 0.008403361344537815], ["envelopes", 0.008403361344537815], ["reading", 0.008403361344537815], ["trout", 0.008403361344537815], ["jobs", 0.008403361344537815], ["lorre", 0.008403361344537815], ["junkies", 0.008403361344537815], ["hepburn", 0.008403361344537815], ["news", 0.008403361344537815], ["messages", 0.008403361344537815], ["foreign", 0.008403361344537815], ["humphrey", 0.008403361344537815], ["diplomats", 0.008403361344537815], ["garbage", 0.008403361344537815], ["feel", 0.008403361344537815], ["logical", 0.008403361344537815], ["respect", 0.008403361344537815], ["speak", 0.008403361344537815], ["city", 0.008403361344537815], ["elevator", 0.008403361344537815], ["type", 0.008403361344537815], ["store", 0.008403361344537815], ["muggers", 0.008403361344537815], ["life", 0.008403361344537815], ["envelope", 0.008403361344537815], ["xerox", 0.008403361344537815], ["lives", 0.008403361344537815], ["hold", 0.008403361344537815], ["stairs", 0.008403361344537815], ["nations", 0.008403361344537815], ["stories", 0.008403361344537815], ["friend", 0.008403361344537815], ["favorite", 0.008403361344537815], ["telephone", 0.008403361344537815], ["bogart", 0.008403361344537815], ["sells", 0.008403361344537815], ["united", 0.008403361344537815], ["answering", 0.008403361344537815], ["kilgore", 0.008403361344537815], ["machine", 0.008403361344537815], ["brownstone", 0.008403361344537815], ["lily", 0.008403361344537815], ["poor", 0.008403361344537815], ["illegally", 0.008403361344537815], ["kinds", 0.008403361344537815], ["chance", 0.008403361344537815], ["lay", 0.008403361344537815], ["saunter", 0.008403361344537815], ["autograph", 0.008403361344537815], ["man", 0.008403361344537815], ["limousines", 0.008403361344537815], ["wife", 0.008403361344537815], ["age", 0.008403361344537815], ["dog", 0.008403361344537815], ["functionaries", 0.008403361344537815]], "sentiment": ["I say I have a few more pages for her to type.

The second-greatest movie ever is All About Eve.\nThere is a chance, moreover, that I will see Katharine Hepburn, a real movie star! She lives only one block from us!

Hey, Pi Ying,\" called the pilot insolently, \"what\u2019s a bishop worth?\"\nPi Ying was amused. \"A knight and a pawn, my boy; a knight and a pawn.\"\nThank God for the lieutenant, thought Kelly. One of the American soldiers grinned. They had been sticking close together, backed against the wall. Now they began to talk among themselves\u2014like a baseball team warming up. At Kelly\u2019s direction, seeming almost unconscious of the meaning of their actions, they moved out onto the board to fill out the ranks.\nPi Ying was speaking again. \"All of your pieces are in place now, except your knights and your queen, Colonel. And you, of course, are the king. Come, come. The game must be over before suppertime.\"\nGently, shepherding them with his long arms, Kelly led his wife and Jerry and Paul to their proper squares. He detested himself for the calm, the detachment with which he did it. He saw the fear and reproach in Margaret\u2019s eyes. She couldn\u2019t understand that he had to be this way\u2014that in his coldness was their only hope for survival. He looked away from Margaret.\nPi Ying clapped his hands for silence. \"There, good; now we can begin.\" He tugged at his ear reflectively. \"I think this is an excellent way of bringing together the Eastern and Western minds, don\u2019t you, Colonel? Here we indulge the American\u2019s love for gambling with our appreciation of profound drama and philosophy.\" Major Barzov whispered impatiently to him. \"Oh, yes,\" said Pi Ying, \"two more rules: We are allowed ten minutes a move, and\u2014this goes without saying\u2014no moves may be taken back. Very well,\" he said, pressing the button on a stop watch and setting it on the balustrade, \"the honor of the first move belongs to the white men.\" He grinned. \"An ancient tradition.\"\n\"Sergeant,\" said Colonel Kelly, his throat tight, \"move two squares forward.\" He looked down at his hands. They were starting to tremble.\n\"I believe I\u2019ll be slightly unconventional,\" said Pi Ying, half turning his head toward the young girl, as though to make sure that she was sharing his enjoyment. \"Move my queen\u2019s pawn forward two squares,\" he instructed a servant.\nColonel Kelly watched the servant slide the massive carving forward\u2014to a point threatening the sergeant.

The Peruvian pilot who gave the rocket the spark of life, Ricardo Cortez, imagined that he had caused it to fall in love with the radar dish of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, who no longer had radar and so, as far as that particular sort of rocket was concerned, was without sex appeal.\nMajor Cortez had made what was called a million years ago \u201can honest mistake.\u201d\nAnd let it be said, too, that Peru would never have ordered an attack on the Bah\u00eda de Darwin if \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d had gone ahead as planned, with a shipload of celebrities. Peru would not have been that insensitive to world opinion. But the cancellation of the cruise made the ship an entirely different kettle of fish, so to speak, a potential troop carrier manned, any reasonable person might assume, by persons who were effectively begging to be blown up or napalmed or machine-gunned or whatever, which is to say \u201cnaval personnel.\u201d\nSo these Colombianos were out there in the marsh in the moonlight, headed for the open ocean and home, eating the first decent meal they had had in a week, and imagining that their radar dish was watching over them like a revolving Virgin Mary. She would never allow any harm to come to them. Little did they know.\nWhat they were eating, incidentally, was an old dairy cow who wasn\u2019t able to give all that much milk anymore. That was what had been under the tarpaulin on the lighter which had provisioned the San Mateo: that dairy cow, still very much alive. And she had been hoisted aboard on the side away from the waterfront, so that people ashore couldn\u2019t see her. There were people ashore desperate enough to kill for her.\nShe was one hell of a lot of protein to be leaving Ecuador.\nIt was interesting how they hoisted her. They didn\u2019t use a sling or a cargo net. They made a rope crown for her, wrapped around and around her horns. They embedded the steel hook at the end of the cable of the crane in the tangled crown. And then the crane operator up above reeled in the cable so that the cow was soon dangling in thin air\u2014in an upright position for the first time in her life, with her hind legs splayed, her udder exposed, and with her front legs thrust out horizontally, so that she had the general configuration of a kangaroo.\nThe evolutionary process which had produced this huge mammal had never anticipated that she might be in such a position, with the weight of her entire body depending from her neck. Her neck as she dangled was coming to resemble that of a blue-footed booby or swan, or flightless cormorant.", 0.10150462962962964], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["great",

still a little boy, and I need a man to take care of me. Dan is a man.\u201d\nSo I slunk to my room, confused and humiliated. I packed up my belongings. She did not see me out. I had no idea what room she had gone to, or what she might be doing there. Nobody saw me out.\nAnd I left that house forever as the sun went down on Saint Patrick\u2019s Day, 1936, without a backward glance at the Gorgon on the front door of Dan Gregory.\nI spent my first night on my own only a block away, at the Vanderbilt YMCA, but would not see or hear from her again for fourteen years. It seemed to me that she had dared me to become a great financial success, and then to come back and take her away from Dan Gregory. I fantasized about that as a real possibility for perhaps a month or two. Such things happened all the time in stories Dan Gregory was given to illustrate.\nShe would not see me again until I was worthy of her. Dan Gregory was working on a new edition of Tales of King Arthur and His Knights when he got rid of me. Marilee had posed as Guinevere. I would bring her the Holy Grail.\nBut the Great Depression soon made clear to me that I would never amount to anything. I couldn\u2019t even provide decent food and a bed for my worthless self, and was frequently a bum among bums in soup kitchens and shelters for the homeless. I improved myself in libraries while keeping warm, reading histories and novels and poems said to be great\u2014and encyclopedias and dictionaries, and the latest self-help books about how to get ahead in the United States of America, how to learn from failures, how to make strangers like and trust you immediately, how to start your own business, how to sell anybody anything, how to put yourself into the hands of God and stop wasting so much time and precious energy worrying. How to eat right.\nI was certainly a child of Dan Gregory, and of the times, too, when I tried to make my vocabulary and familiarity with great issues and events and personalities throughout recorded time equal to those of graduates of great universities. My accent, moreover, was as synthetic as Gregory\u2019s, and so, by the way, was Marilee\u2019s. Marilee and I, a coal miner\u2019s daughter and an Armenian shoemaker\u2019s son, remember, had sense enough not to pretend to be upper-class British. We obscured our humble origins in vocal tones and inflections which had no name back then, as nearly as I can remember, but which are now known as \u201ctrans-Atlantic\u201d\u2014cultivated, pleasant to the ear, and neither British nor American. Marilee and I were brother and sister in that regard: we sounded the same.\nBut when I roamed New York City, knowing so much and capable of speaking so nicely, and yet so lonely, and often hungry and cold, I learned the joke at the core of American self-improvement: knowledge was so much junk to be processed one way or another at great universities. The real treasure the great universities offered was a lifelong membership in a respected artificial extended family.\nMy parents were born into biological families, and big ones, too, which were respected by Armenians in Turkey. I, born in America far from any other Armenians, save for my parents, eventually became a member of two artificial extended families which were reasonably respectable, although surely not the social equals of Harvard or Yale:\nThe Officer Corps of the United States Army in time of war,", 0.14452230639730643], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["holy", 0.08450704225352113], ["people", 0.056338028169014086], ["imagination", 0.028169014084507043], ["strength", 0.028169014084507043], ["heads", 0.028169014084507043], ["imaginations", 0.028169014084507043], ["actors", 0.028169014084507043], ["film", 0.028169014084507043], ["scenery", 0.028169014084507043], ["read", 0.028169014084507043], ["holiness", 0.028169014084507043], ["suspect", 0.014084507042253521], ["tempts", 0.014084507042253521], ["shapely", 0.014084507042253521], ["speaker", 0.014084507042253521], ["dead", 0.014084507042253521], ["appropriate", 0.014084507042253521], ["cure", 0.014084507042253521], ["existence", 0.014084507042253521], ["meditation", 0.014084507042253521], ["find", 0.014084507042253521], ["expensive", 0.014084507042253521], ["nonexistence", 0.014084507042253521], ["perfect", 0.014084507042253521], ["write", 0.014084507042253521], ["things", 0.014084507042253521], ["exposed", 0.014084507042253521], ["unitarian", 0.014084507042253521], ["privilege", 0.014084507042253521], ["music", 0.014084507042253521], ["include", 0.014084507042253521], ["literature", 0.014084507042253521], ["ability", 0.014084507042253521], ["universe", 0.014084507042253521], ["hired", 0.014084507042253521], ["wake", 0.014084507042253521], ["library", 0.014084507042253521], ["occasion", 0.014084507042253521], ["exercises", 0.014084507042253521], ["rare", 0.014084507042253521], ["secrets", 0.014084507042253521], ["planet", 0.014084507042253521], ["television", 0.014084507042253521], ["reading", 0.014084507042253521], ["prescription", 0.014084507042253521], ["language", 0.014084507042253521], ["hideously", 0.014084507042253521], ["healthy", 0.014084507042253521], ["freedom", 0.014084507042253521], ["morning", 0.014084507042253521], ["will", 0.014084507042253521], ["thing", 0.014084507042253521], ["country", 0.014084507042253521], ["surely", 0.014084507042253521]], "sentiment": ["\u201cFilm is a perfect prescription for people who will not or cannot read, and have no imagination.

Unfortunately, the speaker you have hired is a Unitarian. I know almost nothing about holy things.\n\u201cThe language is holy to me, which again shows how little I know about holiness.\n\u201cLiterature is holy to me, which again shows how little I know about holiness.\n\u201cOur freedom to say or write whatever we please in this country is holy to me. It is a rare privilege not only on this planet, but throughout the universe, I suspect. And it is not something somebody gave us. It is a thing we give to ourselves.\n\u201cMeditation is holy to me, for I believe that all the secrets of existence and nonexistence are somewhere in our heads\u2014or in other people\u2019s heads.",

The only conclusion to draw was that crime paid so well that Gribbon could retire in his early forties, and live luxuriously and lawfully for the rest of his days.\n\u201cHis money really does come from stocks and bonds,\u201d I told Hackleman wearily at the end of the second day. \u201cAnd he pays his taxes like a good boy, and never sees his old friends anymore.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, all right, all right,\u201d said Hackleman irritably. \u201cForget it. Never mind.\u201d He was more nervous than I\u2019d ever seen him be before. He drummed on his desk with his fingers, and jumped at unexpected sounds.\n\u201cYou have something special against him?\u201d I asked. It wasn\u2019t like Hackleman to go after anyone with such zeal. Ordinarily, he never seemed to care whether justice or crime won out. What interested him were the good news stories that came out of the conflict. \u201cAfter all, the guy really is going straight.\u201d\n\u201cForget it,\u201d said Hackleman. Suddenly, he broke his pencil in two, stood up, and strode out, hours before his usual departure time.\nThe next day was my day off. I would have slept till noon, but a paper boy was selling extras under my bedroom window. The headline was huge and black, and spelled one terrible word: KIDNAPPED! The story below said that plaster images of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph had been stolen from Mr. J. Sprague Fleetwood, and that he had offered a reward of one thousand dollars for information leading to their return before the judging of the Annual Christmas Outdoor Lighting Contest on Christmas Eve.\nHackleman called a few minutes later. I was to come to the office at once to help trace down the clues that were pouring in.\nThe police complained that, if there were any clues, hordes of amateur detectives had spoiled them. But there was no pressure at all on the police to solve the robbery. By evening the search had become a joyful craze that no one escaped\u2014that no one wanted to escape. And the search was for the people to make, not for the police.\nThrongs went from door to door, asking if anyone had seen the infant Jesus.\nMovie theaters played to empty houses, and a local radio giveaway program said mournfully that nobody seemed to be home in the evenings to answer the telephone.", 0.04296099523372252], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["mother", 0.039603960396039604], ["dr", 0.0297029702970297], ["mott", 0.0297029702970297], ["ritz", 0.0297029702970297], ["detectives", 0.019801980198019802], ["crowd", 0.019801980198019802], ["eliza", 0.019801980198019802], ["told", 0.019801980198019802], ["business", 0.019801980198019802], ["departed", 0.009900990099009901], ["cheap", 0.009900990099009901], ["meter", 0.009900990099009901], ["course", 0.009900990099009901], ["find", 0.009900990099009901], ["28", 0.009900990099009901], ["crying", 0.009900990099009901], ["stationery", 0.009900990099009901], ["east", 0.009900990099009901], ["regrets", 0.009900990099009901], ["happened", 0.009900990099009901], ["returned", 0.009900990099009901], ["puzzled", 0.009900990099009901], ["bit", 0.009900990099009901], ["heaven", 0.009900990099009901], ["stranger", 0.009900990099009901], ["neanderthaler", 0.009900990099009901], ["laughing", 0.009900990099009901], ["nondescript", 0.009900990099009901], ["luck", 0.009900990099009901], ["people", 0.009900990099009901], ["hurried", 0.009900990099009901], ["curious", 0.009900990099009901], ["blue", 0.009900990099009901], ["velvet", 0.009900990099009901], ["ruffled", 0.009900990099009901], ["expressed", 0.009900990099009901], ["written", 0.009900990099009901], ["champagne", 0.009900990099009901], ["full", 0.009900990099009901], ["supernova", 0.009900990099009901], ["forma", 0.009900990099009901], ["separation", 0.009900990099009901], ["news", 0.009900990099009901], ["care", 0.009900990099009901], ["graduation", 0.009900990099009901], ["leaving", 0.009900990099009901], ["turn", 0.009900990099009901], ["introduced", 0.009900990099009901], ["love", 0.009900990099009901], ["spoken", 0.009900990099009901], ["tuxedo", 0.009900990099009901], ["private", 0.009900990099009901], ["marvelous", 0.009900990099009901], ["simply", 0.009900990099009901], ["guests", 0.009900990099009901], ["long", 0.009900990099009901], ["suit", 0.009900990099009901], ["door", 0.009900990099009901], ["stationed", 0.009900990099009901], ["hear", 0.009900990099009901], ["ho", 0.009900990099009901], ["hints", 0.009900990099009901], ["room", 0.009900990099009901], ["hour", 0.009900990099009901], ["middle", 0.009900990099009901], ["pressed", 0.009900990099009901], ["meet", 0.009900990099009901], ["voice", 0.009900990099009901], ["robin", 0.009900990099009901], ["boston", 0.009900990099009901], ["pro", 0.009900990099009901], ["talking", 0.009900990099009901], ["aged", 0.009900990099009901], ["shirt", 0.009900990099009901], ["doctor", 0.009900990099009901], ["dressed", 0.009900990099009901], ["note", 0.009900990099009901], ["parts", 0.009900990099009901], ["party", 0.009900990099009901], ["nice", 0.009900990099009901], ["staying", 0.009900990099009901], ["ballroom", 0.009900990099009901], ["vermont", 0.009900990099009901], ["spent", 0.009900990099009901], ["looked", 0.009900990099009901], ["time", 0.009900990099009901], ["egg", 0.009900990099009901]], "sentiment": ["Hi ho.\n28\nI RETURNED TO THE RITZ, laughing and crying\u2014a two-meter Neanderthaler in a ruffled shirt and a robin\u2019s-egg blue velvet tuxedo.\nThere was a crowd of people who were curious about the brief supernova in the east, and about the voice which had spoken from Heaven of separation and love.

He wore a swallowtail coat and striped trousers and spats. He was the sole salesman, and had been since Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-one. He was the man who had released from the hot cage of his hands and into this enchanted space the first two prothonotary warblers. He was ninety-two years old! He looked like John D. Rockefeller at the end of his life, or like a mummy. The only moisture left in him, seemingly, was faint dew on the surface of his eyes. He was not entirely defenseless, however. He was president of a pistol club that shot at targets shaped like men on weekends, and he had a loaded Luger the size of a Doberman pinscher in his desk. He had been looking forward to a robbery for quite some time.\n\u201cOh\u2014it\u2019s you,\u201d he said to Mary Kathleen, and she said that, yes, it was.\nShe was accustomed to coming here almost every day and sitting for several hours. The understanding was that she was to get out of sight with her shopping bags, in case a customer came in. There was a further understanding, which Mary Kathleen had now violated.\n\u201cI thought I told you,\u201d he said to her, \u201cthat you were never to bring anybody else with you, or even to tell anybody else how nice it was up here.\u201d\nSince I was carrying three shopping bags, he concluded that I was another derelict, a shopping-bag man.\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t a bum,\u201d said Mary Kathleen. \u201cHe\u2019s a Harvard man.\u201d\nHe did not believe this for a minute. \u201cI see,\u201d he said, and he looked me up and down. He himself had never even graduated from grammar school, incidentally. There had been no laws against child labor when he was a boy, and he had gone to work in the Chicago factory of The American Harp Company at the age of ten. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that you can always tell a Harvard man,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t tell him much.\u201d\n\u201cI never thought there was anything special about Harvard men,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d he said. He was being most unpleasant, and clearly wanted me out of there. \u201cThis is not the Salvation Army,\u201d he said. This was a man born during the presidency of Grover Cleveland. Imagine that! He said to Mary Kathleen, \u201cReally\u2014I\u2019m most disappointed in you, bringing somebody else along. Should we expect three tomorrow, and twenty the day after that? Christianity does have its limits, you know.\u201d\nI now made a blunder that would land me back in el calabozo before noon on what was to have been my first full day of freedom. \u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m here on business.\u201d", 0.06311249137336095], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["father", 0.05747126436781609], ["newt", 0.034482758620689655], ["work", 0.034482758620689655], ["house", 0.022988505747126436], ["big", 0.022988505747126436], ["life", 0.022988505747126436], ["knew", 0.022988505747126436], ["making", 0.022988505747126436], ["days", 0.022988505747126436], ["times", 0.022988505747126436], ["beautiful", 0.011494252873563218], ["tek", 0.011494252873563218], ["ten", 0.011494252873563218], ["suddenly", 0.011494252873563218], ["alive", 0.011494252873563218], ["soul", 0.011494252873563218], ["noise", 0.011494252873563218], ["long", 0.011494252873563218], ["harrison", 0.011494252873563218], ["wasn", 0.011494252873563218], ["close", 0.011494252873563218], ["laboratory", 0.011494252873563218], ["happen", 0.011494252873563218], ["bills", 0.011494252873563218], ["ghosts", 0.011494252873563218], ["weapons", 0.011494252873563218], ["death", 0.011494252873563218], ["stood", 0.011494252873563218], ["spoke", 0.011494252873563218], ["driving", 0.011494252873563218], ["conners", 0.011494252873563218], ["thinking", 0.011494252873563218], ["continued", 0.011494252873563218], ["sitting", 0.011494252873563218], ["hot", 0.011494252873563218], ["angela", 0.011494252873563218], ["eat", 0.011494252873563218], ["romance", 0.011494252873563218], ["secret", 0.011494252873563218], ["bundling", 0.011494252873563218], ["electronics", 0.011494252873563218], ["ilium", 0.011494252873563218], ["war", 0.011494252873563218], ["happy", 0.011494252873563218], ["indianapolis", 0.011494252873563218], ["door", 0.011494252873563218], ["fabri", 0.011494252873563218], ["government", 0.011494252873563218], ["started", 0.011494252873563218], ["assistant", 0.011494252873563218], ["paid", 0.011494252873563218], ["disappeared", 0.011494252873563218], ["unbundling", 0.011494252873563218], ["awful", 0.011494252873563218], ["thing", 0.011494252873563218], ["general", 0.011494252873563218], ["friends", 0.011494252873563218], ["day", 0.011494252873563218], ["died", 0.011494252873563218], ["care", 0.011494252873563218], ["paying", 0.011494252873563218], ["knock", 0.011494252873563218], ["cold", 0.011494252873563218], ["weeks", 0.011494252873563218], ["couldn", 0.011494252873563218], ["frank", 0.011494252873563218], ["talked", 0.011494252873563218], ["turn", 0.011494252873563218], ["marriage", 0.011494252873563218], ["attention", 0.011494252873563218], ["meet", 0.011494252873563218], ["nice", 0.011494252873563218]], "sentiment": ["\u201cElectronics?\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you, even if I knew.

this way and that at first, before it gained sufficient altitude for the prevailing wind to take it across the lake. What caused me to change course, however, wasn\u2019t random gusts but the possibility of running into this person or that one who had the power to make me even more uncomfortable. I particularly did not want to run into Zuzu Johnson or the departing Artist in Residence, Pamela Ford Hall.\nBut life being what it was, I would of course run into both of them.\nI WOULD RATHER have faced Zuzu than Pamela, since Pamela had gone all to pieces and Zuzu hadn\u2019t. But as I say, I would have to face them both.\nI wasn\u2019t what had shoved Pamela over the edge. It was her 1-woman show in Buffalo a couple of months earlier. What went wrong with it seemed funny to everybody but her, and it was in the papers and on TV. For a couple of days she was the light side of the news, comic relief from reports of the rapid growth of glaciers at the poles and the desert where the Amazon rain forest used to be. And I am sure there was another oil spill. There was always another oil spill.\nIf Denver and Santa Fe and Le Havre, France, hadn\u2019t been evacuated yet because of atomic wastes in their water supplies, they soon would be.\nWHAT HAPPENED TO Pamela\u2019s 1-woman show also gave a lot of people an opportunity to jeer at modern art, which only rich people claimed to like.\nAs I\u2019ve said, Pamela worked in polyurethane, which is easy to carve and weighs almost nothing, and smells like urine when it\u2019s hot. Her figures, moreover, were small, women in full skirts, sitting and hunched over so you couldn\u2019t see their faces. A shoe-box could have contained any 1 of them.\nSo they were displayed on pedestals in Buffalo, but they weren\u2019t glued down. Wind was not considered a problem, since there were 3 sets of doors between her stuff and the main entrance to the museum, which faced Lake Erie.\nTHE MUSEUM, THE Hanson Centre for the Arts, was brand-new, a gift to the city from a Rockefeller heir living in Buffalo who had come into a great deal of money from the sale of Rockefeller Center in Manhattan to the Japanese. This was an old lady in a wheelchair. She hadn\u2019t stepped on a mine in Vietnam.
