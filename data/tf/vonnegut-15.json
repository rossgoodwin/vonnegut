I will not track dirt into the house needlessly, by such means as not wiping my feet on the mat outside, and by wearing my bedroom slippers to take out the garbage, and other things;\nc. I will throw such things as used up match folders, empty cigarette packages, the piece of cardboard that comes in shirt collars, etc, into a wastebasket instead of leaving them around on chairs and the floor;\nd.

She was terrified of old Gunther. She told me one time that all nice little girls were supposed to run away from him. Right up until the time Mother died, she cringed if August Gunther was mentioned. He was a hobgoblin to her. He was the bogeyman.\nAs for the pair of great doors facing south: Father had them bolted shut and padlocked, and the workmen caulked the cracks between and around them, to keep out the wind. And then August Gunther cut a front door into one of them. That was the entrance to Father\u2019s studio, what would later be my childhood home.\nA hexagonal loft encircled and overhung the great chamber. This was partitioned off into bedrooms and bathrooms and a small library.\nAbove that was an attic under the conical slate roof. Father had no immediate use for the attic, so it was left in its primitive condition.\nIt was all so impractical\u2014which I guess was the whole idea.\nFather was so elated by the vastness of the ground floor, which was paved with cobblestones laid in sand, that he considered putting the kitchen up on a loft. But that would have put the servants and all their hustle and bustle and cooking smells up among the bedrooms. There was no basement to put them in.\nSo he reluctantly put the kitchen on the ground floor, tucked under a loft and partitioned off with old boards. It was cramped and stuffy. I would love it.

talks about it. He has one of the tenant\u2019s houses all to himself, and he spends most of his spare time there. He never goes into town, and the General has him working by himself, or with us, so there isn\u2019t much chance for him to get into trouble with anybody.\u201d\n\u201cIs he married? What does he do with his money?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as we know, he\u2019s a bachelor, but he keeps that house cleaner than a woman would. The General thinks he\u2019s got his money hidden in the house somewhere, because he never goes anywhere where he could spend it. We do all his shopping for him, and he never buys anything but food and tobacco and padlocks,\u201d Hope explained matter-of-factly. \u201cThat\u2019s the really funny thing about him \u2014 the locks. If you make a trip into town, chances are he\u2019ll ask you to get him one. He\u2019s got padlocks all over that house. There were four on his front door the last time I counted.\u201d\nThe General called from below, \u201cLunch time!\u201d To Haley the announcement was incredible. At 9 a.m., after watching four rural hours inch by, he had concluded that the clocks of Ardennes Farm were lubricated with molasses, and that noon was still a century away in terms of time as he had known it in the city.\nNoon brought with it the solid blessings of strong coffee and whole milk, of strawberry jam and biscuits, of ham and gravy. It was an hour of peace and plenty, reminding Haley of a medieval custom he had read about \u2014 whereby a condemned man was hanged and skillfully revived several times before being permitted to expire completely. The analogy did not spoil his appetite. He wolfed his food, excused himself, and lay down on the sunroom couch.\nBits of conversation from the kitchen infiltrated his consciousness. He stored them away, too weary to think much about them. Kitty, who, Annie had said, had slept until 11, was defending her relationship with Roy Flemming, her beau of the night before. She seemed agitated, punctuating her replies to the General\u2019s poignant assaults on Roy\u2019s character with nose blowing. She declared that she loved Roy, and that this was one romance her father was not going to break up. There seemed to have been plenty of cases where the General had succeeded in doing just that.\n\u201cUntil you\u2019re twenty-one, young lady, let me be the judge of who your associates should be,\u201d Haley heard the General say. \u201cAfter that, you\u2019re free to marry anybody, simply anybody \u2014 Flemming, Mr. Banghart, or the next bum who stops for a handout. Until that happy day, however, I am very much in charge. Do we understand each other?\u201d Kitty hastened past Haley\u2019s aching form, and hurried up stairs to slam her bedroom door on a loveless world for lovers.\n\u201cH-hour!\u201d shouted the General, and he harangued his flagging troops into the field once more.\nIn an eon came evening, to cool, and to displace the sounds of daytime with whispers and croaks and sounds like rusty hinges from grass-tuft sanctuaries in woods and pastures, and from lily pads a quarter of a mile away.\nAnnie had prepared supper an hour ago, and, from the small window at the end of a long corridor between bales in the loft, Haley could see her putting it into the oven to keep it warm. He, Hope, and Mr. Banghart, meeting a quota set by the General, were stacking the last wagonload in the barn. The General had returned to the house, leaving the three of them to handle what remained without his supervision. It was much cooler, and, with him gone, an element of playfulness came into the business of lugging bales. Haley found his burdens miraculously lightened. Mr. Banghart sang a medley of rhythmic spirituals, setting a tempo by which they tugged and lifted.

If I ever do finish it, though, I give you my word of honor: there won\u2019t be a part for Frank Sinatra or John Wayne.\n\u201cI tell you what,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll call it \u2018The Children\u2019s Crusade.\u2019\u201d\nShe was my friend after that.\nO\u2019Hare and I gave up on remembering, went into the living room, talked about other things. We became curious about the real Children\u2019s Crusade, so O\u2019Hare looked it up in a book he had, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, by Charles Mackay, LL. D. It was first published in London in 1841.\nMackay had a low opinion of all Crusades. The Children\u2019s Crusade struck him as only slightly more sordid than the ten Crusades for grown-ups. O\u2019Hare read this handsome passage out loud:\nHistory in her solemn page informs us that the crusaders were but ignorant and savage men, that their motives were those of bigotry unmitigated, and that their pathway was one of blood and tears. Romance, on the other hand, dilates upon their piety and heroism, and portrays, in her most glowing and impassioned hues, their virtue and magnanimity, the imperishable honor they acquired for themselves, and the great services they rendered to Christianity.", 0.1860930735930736], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["constant", 0.05825242718446602], ["white", 0.05825242718446602], ["room", 0.04854368932038835], ["rumfoord", 0.038834951456310676], ["girl", 0.02912621359223301], ["feet", 0.02912621359223301], ["ceiling", 0.019417475728155338], ["led", 0.019417475728155338], ["things", 0.009708737864077669], ["shoes", 0.009708737864077669], ["ten", 0.009708737864077669], ["wouldn", 0.009708737864077669], ["door", 0.009708737864077669], ["puddle", 0.009708737864077669], ["reins", 0.009708737864077669], ["life", 0.009708737864077669], ["socks", 0.009708737864077669], ["sign", 0.009708737864077669], ["paused", 0.009708737864077669], ["decided", 0.009708737864077669], ["long", 0.009708737864077669], ["mansion", 0.009708737864077669], ["pony", 0.009708737864077669], ["worried", 0.009708737864077669], ["dress", 0.009708737864077669], ["huge", 0.009708737864077669], ["wanted", 0.009708737864077669], ["pardon", 0.009708737864077669], ["closet", 0.009708737864077669], ["cleanest", 0.009708737864077669], ["broom", 0.009708737864077669], ["boy", 0.009708737864077669], ["spiral", 0.009708737864077669], ["tiny", 0.009708737864077669], ["mud", 0.009708737864077669], ["high", 0.009708737864077669], ["strange", 0.009708737864077669], ["malachi", 0.009708737864077669], ["chimney", 0.009708737864077669], ["pure", 0.009708737864077669], ["corridor", 0.009708737864077669], ["limp", 0.009708737864077669], ["nice", 0.009708737864077669], ["picture", 0.009708737864077669], ["oil", 0.009708737864077669], ["holding", 0.009708737864077669], ["staircase", 0.009708737864077669], ["wide", 0.009708737864077669], ["big", 0.009708737864077669], ["hand", 0.009708737864077669], ["architectural", 0.009708737864077669], ["fell", 0.009708737864077669], ["rest", 0.009708737864077669], ["smiled", 0.009708737864077669], ["child", 0.009708737864077669], ["bit", 0.009708737864077669], ["insisted", 0.009708737864077669], ["starched", 0.009708737864077669], ["abruptly", 0.009708737864077669], ["bonnet", 0.009708737864077669], ["accident", 0.009708737864077669], ["wore", 0.009708737864077669], ["wife", 0.009708737864077669], ["frozen", 0.009708737864077669], ["expression", 0.009708737864077669], ["larger", 0.009708737864077669], ["magical", 0.009708737864077669], ["face", 0.009708737864077669], ["admire", 0.009708737864077669], ["chairs", 0.009708737864077669], ["bad", 0.009708737864077669], ["uncertainly", 0.009708737864077669], ["gloves", 0.009708737864077669], ["dirty", 0.009708737864077669], ["twenty", 0.009708737864077669], ["closing", 0.009708737864077669], ["heart", 0.009708737864077669], ["painting", 0.009708737864077669], ["wing", 0.009708737864077669], ["rooms", 0.009708737864077669]], "sentiment": ["He paused in one, insisted that Constant admire a huge oil painting of a little girl holding the reins of a pure white pony.

That was how important mere opinions used to be back in the era of great big brains.\nMere opinions, in fact, were as likely to govern people\u2019s actions as hard evidence, and were subject to sudden reversals as hard evidence could never be. So the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands could be hell in one moment and heaven in the next, and Julius Caesar could be a statesman in one moment and a butcher in the next, and Ecuadorian paper money could be traded for food, shelter, and clothing in one moment and line the bottom of a birdcage in the next, and the universe could be created by God Almighty in one moment and by a big explosion in the next\u2014and on and on.\nThanks to their decreased brainpower, people aren\u2019t diverted from the main business of life by the hobgoblins of opinions anymore.\nWhite people discovered the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in 1535 when a Spanish ship came upon them after being blown off course by a storm. Nobody was living there, nor were remains of any human settlement ever found there.\nThis unlucky ship wished nothing more than to carry the Bishop of Panama to Peru, never losing sight of the South American coast. There was this storm, which rudely hustled it westward, ever westward, where prevailing human opinion insisted there was only sea and more sea.\nBut when the storm lifted, the Spaniards found that they had delivered their bishop into a sailor\u2019s nightmare where the bits of land were mockeries, without safe anchorage or shade or sweet water or dangling fruit, or human beings of any kind. They were becalmed, and running out of water and food. The ocean was like a mirror. They put a longboat over the side, and towed their vessel and their spiritual leader out of there.\nThey did not claim the islands for Spain, any more than they would have claimed hell for Spain. And for three full centuries after revised human opinion allowed the archipelago to appear on maps, no other nation wished to own it. But then in 1832, one of the smallest and poorest countries on the planet, which was Ecuador, asked the peoples of the world to share this opinion with them: that the islands were part of Ecuador.\nNo one objected. At the time, it seemed a harmless and even comical opinion. It was as though Ecuador, in a spasm of imperialistic dementia, had annexed to its territory a passing cloud of asteroids.\nBut then young Charles Darwin, only three years later, began to persuade others that the often freakish plants and animals which had found ways to survive on the islands made them extremely valuable, if only people would look at them as he did\u2014from a scientific point of view.\nOnly one English word adequately describes his transformation of the islands from worthless to priceless: magical.", 0.09175000000000001], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["movie", 0.058823529411764705], ["father", 0.04411764705882353], ["mama", 0.029411764705882353], ["bartholomew", 0.014705882352941176], ["boyhood", 0.014705882352941176], ["san", 0.014705882352941176], ["welcomed", 0.014705882352941176], ["absolutely", 0.014705882352941176], ["america", 0.014705882352941176], ["years", 0.014705882352941176], ["states", 0.014705882352941176], ["year", 0.014705882352941176], ["proofs", 0.014705882352941176], ["bijou", 0.014705882352941176], ["ignacio", 0.014705882352941176], ["foothold", 0.014705882352941176], ["working", 0.014705882352941176], ["agency", 0.014705882352941176], ["long", 0.014705882352941176], ["captains", 0.014705882352941176], ["lights", 0.014705882352941176], ["loved", 0.014705882352941176], ["depression", 0.014705882352941176], ["war", 0.014705882352941176], ["store", 0.014705882352941176], ["circe", 0.014705882352941176], ["spencer", 0.014705882352941176], ["lived", 0.014705882352941176], ["north", 0.014705882352941176], ["god", 0.014705882352941176], ["living", 0.014705882352941176], ["disappeared", 0.014705882352941176], ["freddie", 0.014705882352941176], ["united", 0.014705882352941176], ["california", 0.014705882352941176], ["starring", 0.014705882352941176], ["child", 0.014705882352941176], ["remarrying", 0.014705882352941176], ["theater", 0.014705882352941176], ["tracy", 0.014705882352941176], ["1938", 0.014705882352941176], ["advertising", 0.014705882352941176], ["courageous", 0.014705882352941176], ["died", 0.014705882352941176], ["satisfaction", 0.014705882352941176], ["great", 0.014705882352941176], ["cod", 0.014705882352941176], ["word", 0.014705882352941176], ["artist", 0.014705882352941176], ["considered", 0.014705882352941176], ["die", 0.014705882352941176], ["manhattan", 0.014705882352941176], ["planet", 0.014705882352941176], ["rueful", 0.014705882352941176], ["cyclops", 0.014705882352941176], ["endure", 0.014705882352941176], ["berman", 0.014705882352941176], ["fishermen", 0.014705882352941176], ["atlantic", 0.014705882352941176], ["entirely", 0.014705882352941176], ["economy", 0.014705882352941176], ["asked", 0.014705882352941176]], "sentiment": ["\u201cSo long, Mama,\u201d said Circe Berman.\nThere was that word Mama again.\n\u201cAt least she didn\u2019t have to endure the Great Depression, which was only one year away,\u201d I said.\nAnd at least she didn\u2019t have to see her only child come home a cyclops from World War Two.\n\u201cAnd how did your father die?\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn the Bijou Theater in San Ignacio in 1938,\u201d I said. \u201cHe went to the movie alone.

living, that he thought I should have nothing to do with the arts. He warned me away from the arts because he had found them so useless as a way of producing money. He told me I could go to college only if I studied something serious, something practical.\nAs an undergraduate at Cornell I was a chemistry major because my brother was a big-shot chemist. Critics feel that a person cannot be a serious artist and also have had a technical education, which I had. I know that customarily English departments in universities, without knowing what they\u2019re doing, teach dread of the engineering department, the physics department, and the chemistry department. And this fear, I think, is carried over into criticism. Most of our critics are products of English departments and are very suspicious of anyone who takes an interest in technology. So, anyway, I was a chemistry major, but I\u2019m always winding up as a teacher in English departments, so I\u2019ve brought scientific thinking to literature. There\u2019s been very little gratitude for this.\nI became a so-called science fiction writer when someone decreed that I was a science fiction writer. I did not want to be classified as one, so I wondered in what way I\u2019d offended that I would not get credit for being a serious writer. I decided that it was because I wrote about technology, and most fine American writers know nothing about technology. I got classified as a science fiction writer simply because I wrote about Schenectady, New York. My first book, Player Piano, was about Schenectady. There are huge factories in Schenectady and nothing else. I and my associates were engineers, physicists, chemists, and mathematicians. And when I wrote about the General Electric Company and Schenectady, it seemed a fantasy of the future to critics who had never seen the place.\nI think that novels that leave out technology misrepresent life as badly as Victorians misrepresented life by leaving out sex.\nIn 1968, the year I wrote Slaughterhouse Five, I finally became grown up enough to write about the bombing of Dresden. It was the largest massacre in European history. I, of course, know about Auschwitz, but a massacre is something that happens suddenly, the killing of a whole lot of people in a very short time. In Dresden, on February 13, 1945, about 135,000 people were killed by British firebombing in one night.\nIt was pure nonsense, pointless destruction. The whole city was burned down, and it was a British atrocity, not ours. They sent in night bombers, and they came in and set the whole town on fire with a new kind of incendiary bomb. And so everything organic, except my little POW group, was consumed by fire. It was a military experiment to find out if you could burn down a whole city by scattering incendiaries over it.\nOf course, as prisoners of war, we dealt hands-on with dead Germans, digging them out of basements because they had suffocated there, and taking them to a huge funeral pyre. And I heard\u2014I didn\u2019t see it done\u2014that they gave up this procedure because it was too slow and, of course, the city was starting to smell pretty bad. And they sent in guys with flamethrowers.\nWhy my fellow prisoners of war and I weren\u2019t killed I don\u2019t know.\nI was a writer in 1968. I was a hack. I\u2019d write anything to make money, you know. And what the hell, I\u2019d seen this thing, I\u2019d been through it, and so I was going to write a hack book about Dresden. You know, the kind that would be made into a movie and where Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra and the others would play us. I tried to write, but I just couldn\u2019t get it right. I kept writing crap.\nSo I went to a friend\u2019s house\u2014Bernie O\u2019Hare, who\u2019d been my pal. And we were trying to remember funny stuff about our time as prisoners of war in Dresden, tough talk and all that, stuff that would make a nifty war movie. And his wife, Mary O\u2019Hare, blew her stack. She said, \u201cYou were nothing but babies then.\u201d", -0.0012155647382920045], "title": "A Man without a Country"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["books", 0.04477611940298507], ["read",

remains our right and our responsibility to decide what books our children are going to be made to read in our community.\u201d This is surely so. But it is also true that if you exercise that right and fulfill that responsibility in an ignorant, harsh, un-American manner, then people are entitled to call you bad citizens and fools. Even your own children are entitled to call you that.\nI read in the newspaper that your community is mystified by the outcry from all over the country about what you have done. Well, you have discovered that Drake is a part of American civilization, and your fellow Americans can\u2019t stand it that you have behaved in such an uncivilized way. Perhaps you will learn from this that books are sacred to free men for very good reasons, and that wars have been fought against nations which hate books and burn them. If you are an American, you must allow all ideas to circulate freely in your community, not merely your own.\nIf you and your board are now determined to show that you in fact have wisdom and maturity when you exercise your powers over the education of your young, then you should acknowledge that it was a rotten lesson you taught young people in a free society when you denounced and then burned books\u2014books you hadn\u2019t even read. You should also resolve to expose your children to all sorts of opinions and information, in order that they will be better equipped to make decisions and to survive.\nAgain: you have insulted me, and I am a good citizen, and I am very real.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThat was seven years ago. There has so far been no reply. At this very moment, as I write in New York City, Slaughterhouse-Five has been banned from school libraries not fifty miles from here. A legal battle begun several years ago rages on. The school board in question has found lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment tooth and nail. There is never a shortage anywhere of lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment, as though it were nothing more than a clause in a lease from a crooked slumlord.\nAt the start of that particular litigation, on March 24th of 1976, I wrote a comment for the Op-Ed page of the Long Island edition of The New York Times. It went like this:\nA school board has denounced some books again\u2014out in Levittown this time. One of the books was mine. I hear about un-American nonsense like this twice a year or so. One time out in North Dakota, the books were actually burned in a furnace. I had a laugh. It was such an ignorant, dumb, superstitious thing to do.\nIt was so cowardly, too\u2014to make a great show of attacking artifacts.

He looked at her dazedly, then permitted her to lead him away as easily as she might have led a toy balloon.\n3\nNORMAN MUSHARI learned that, on the night of A\u00efda, Eliot disappeared again, jumped out of his homeward-bound cab at Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue.\nTen days later, Sylvia got this letter, which was written on the stationery of the Elsinore Volunteer Fire Department, Elsinore, California. The name of the place set him off on a new line of speculation about himself, to the effect that he was a lot like Shakespeare's Hamlet.\nDear Ophelia\u2014\nElsinore isn't quite what I expected, or maybe there's more than one, and I've come to the wrong one. The high school football players here call themselves \"The Fighting Danes.\" In the surrounding towns they're known as \"The Melancholy Danes.\" In the past three years they have won one game, tied two, and lost twenty-four. That's what happens, I guess, when Hamlet goes in as quarterback.\nThe last thing you said to me before I got out of the taxicab was that maybe we should get a divorce. I did not realize that life had become that uncomfortable for you. I do realize that I am a very slow realizer. I still find it hard to realize that I am an alcoholic, though even strangers know this right away.", 0.013993178538633085], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf":

the Pinkerton Detective Agency. That agency still exists and prospers, and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of The RAMJAC Corporation.\nDaniel McCone had two sons, Alexander Hamilton McCone, then twenty-two, and John, twenty-five. Alexander had graduated without distinction from Harvard in the previous May. He was soft, he was shy, he was a stammerer. John, the elder son and the company\u2019s heir apparent, had flunked out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his freshman year, and had been his father\u2019s most trusted aide ever since.\nThe workers to a man, strikers and nonstrikers alike, hated the father and his son John, but acknowledged that they knew more about shaping iron and steel than anybody else in the world. As for young Alexander: They found him girllike and stupid and too cowardly ever to come near the furnaces and forges and drop hammers, where the most dangerous work was done. Workers would sometimes wave their handkerchiefs at him, as a salute to his futility as a man.\nWhen Walter F. Starbuck, in whose mind this legend is, asked Alexander years later why he had ever gone to work in such an unhospitable place after Harvard, especially since Alexander\u2019s father had not insisted on it, he stammered out a reply, which when unscrambled, was this: \u201cI then believed that a rich man should have some understanding of the place from which his riches came. That was very juvenile of me. Great wealth should be accepted unquestioningly, or not at all.\u201d\nAbout Alexander\u2019s stammers before the Cuyahoga Massacre: They were little more than grace notes expressing excessive modesty. Never had one left him mute for more than three seconds, with all his thoughts held prisoner inside.\nAnd he would not have done much talking in the presence of his dynamic father and brother in any event. But his silence came to conceal a secret that was increasingly pleasant with each passing day: He was coming to understand the business as well as they did. Before they announced a decision, he almost always knew what it would be and should be\u2014and why. Nobody else knew it yet, but he, too, by God, was an industrialist and an engineer.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen the strike came in October, he was able to guess many of the things that should be done, even though he had never been through a strike before. Harvard was a million miles away. Nothing he had ever learned there would get the factory going again. But the Pinkerton Agency would, and the police would\u2014and perhaps the National Guard. Before his father and brother said so, Alexander knew that there were plenty of men in other parts of the country who were desperate enough to take a job at almost any wage. When his father and brother did say this, he learned something else about business: There were companies, often pretending to be labor unions, whose sole business was to recruit such men.\nBy the end of November the chimneys of the factory were belching smoke again. The strikers had no money left for rent or food or fuel. Every large employer within three hundred miles had been sent their names, so he would know what troublemakers they had been. Their nominal leader, Colin Jarvis, was in jail, awaiting trial on a trumped-up murder charge.", 0.02611416361416362], "title": "Jailbird"}, "petrified-ants": {"tfidf": [["josef",

Embedded in it was the last of the pincerless ants, ringed by his murderers. It was the only fossil from Borgorov\u2019s hole that remained above the surface of the earth. Borgorov had made the brothers write a report on the ants as he saw them, had had every last fossil shoveled back into the bottomless cavity, and had shipped Josef and Peter to Siberia. It was a thorough piece of work, not likely to be criticized.\nJosef had pushed aside a pile of brush, and was now staring with fascination at the bared patch of earth. An ant emerged furtively from a hole, carrying an egg. It ran around in crazy circles, then scurried back into the darkness of the tiny earth womb. \u201cA marvelous adjustment ants have made, isn\u2019t it, Peter?\u201d said Josef enviously. \u201cThe good life\u2014efficient, uncomplicated. Instinct makes all the decisions.\u201d He sneezed. \u201cWhen I die, I think I\u2019d like to be reincarnated as an ant. A modern ant, not a capitalist ant,\u201d he added quickly.\n\u201cWhat makes you so sure you aren\u2019t one?\u201d said Peter.\nJosef shrugged off the jibe. \u201cMen could learn a lot from ants, Peter, my boy.\u201d\n\u201cThey have, Josef, they have,\u201d said Peter wearily. \u201cMore than they know.\u201d\nKURT VONNEGUT was a master of contemporary American literature.

She put the same question to it several times during the day, and each time Confido changed the subject quickly\u2014usually taking up the matter of money\u2019s being able to buy happiness, no matter what anyone said.\n\u201cAs Kin Hubbard said,\u201d whispered Confido, \u201c\u2018It ain\u2019t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.\u2019\u201d\nEllen giggled, though she\u2019d heard the quotation before. \u201cNow, listen, you\u2014\u201d she said. All her arguments with Confido were of this extremely mild nature. Confido had a knack of saying things she didn\u2019t agree with in such a way and at such a time that she couldn\u2019t help agreeing a little.\n\u201cMrs. Bowers\u2014El-len,\u201d called a voice outside. The caller was Mrs. Fink, the Bowerses\u2019 next-door neighbor, whose driveway ran along the bedroom side of the Bowerses\u2019 home. Mrs. Fink was racing the engine of her new car by Ellen\u2019s bedroom window.\nEllen leaned out over the windowsill. \u201cMy,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you look nice. Is that a new dress? It suits your complexion perfectly. Most women can\u2019t wear orange.\u201d\n\u201cJust the ones with complexions like salami,\u201d said Confido.\n\u201cAnd what have you done to your hair? I love it that way. It\u2019s just right for an oval face.\u201d\n\u201cLike a mildewed bathing cap,\u201d said Confido.", 0.10354707792207792], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["tarkington", 0.020833333333333332], ["mother", 0.020833333333333332], ["children", 0.013888888888888888], ["trouble", 0.013888888888888888], ["heaven", 0.013888888888888888], ["keyboard", 0.013888888888888888], ["college", 0.013888888888888888], ["subject", 0.013888888888888888], ["job", 0.013888888888888888], ["great", 0.013888888888888888], ["manna", 0.013888888888888888], ["war", 0.013888888888888888], ["life", 0.013888888888888888], ["bells", 0.013888888888888888], ["wife", 0.013888888888888888], ["neighbors", 0.006944444444444444], ["lack", 0.006944444444444444], ["souls", 0.006944444444444444], ["rest", 0.006944444444444444], ["disabled", 0.006944444444444444], ["lutz", 0.006944444444444444], ["invariably", 0.006944444444444444], ["ropes", 0.006944444444444444], ["craziness", 0.006944444444444444], ["writing", 0.006944444444444444], ["symptoms", 0.006944444444444444], ["cherries", 0.006944444444444444], ["inherited", 0.006944444444444444], ["teaching", 0.006944444444444444], ["scipio", 0.006944444444444444], ["infernal", 0.006944444444444444], ["happened", 0.006944444444444444], ["amorous", 0.006944444444444444], ["big", 0.006944444444444444], ["vacuum", 0.006944444444444444], ["credentials", 0.006944444444444444], ["accepted", 0.006944444444444444], ["realize", 0.006944444444444444], ["sane", 0.006944444444444444], ["officer", 0.006944444444444444], ["team", 0.006944444444444444], ["tower", 0.006944444444444444], ["approaching", 0.006944444444444444], ["comatose", 0.006944444444444444], ["chunk", 0.006944444444444444], ["excelled", 0.006944444444444444], ["idea", 0.006944444444444444], ["library", 0.006944444444444444], ["unexpectedly", 0.006944444444444444], ["carillon", 0.006944444444444444], ["conscience", 0.006944444444444444], ["degree", 0.006944444444444444], ["inhuman", 0.006944444444444444], ["students", 0.006944444444444444], ["stupid", 0.006944444444444444], ["trap", 0.006944444444444444], ["full", 0.006944444444444444], ["intellects", 0.006944444444444444], ["booby", 0.006944444444444444], ["forgive", 0.006944444444444444], ["electrified", 0.006944444444444444], ["york", 0.006944444444444444], ["bs", 0.006944444444444444], ["relating", 0.006944444444444444], ["wanted", 0.006944444444444444], ["daughter", 0.006944444444444444], ["ahead", 0.006944444444444444], ["35", 0.006944444444444444], ["reproducing", 0.006944444444444444], ["asked", 0.006944444444444444], ["family", 0.006944444444444444], ["point", 0.006944444444444444], ["learning", 0.006944444444444444], ["luck", 0.006944444444444444], ["mere", 0.006944444444444444], ["teach", 0.006944444444444444], ["west", 0.006944444444444444], ["top", 0.006944444444444444], ["call", 0.006944444444444444], ["interest", 0.006944444444444444], ["biggest", 0.006944444444444444], ["speaking", 0.006944444444444444], ["plain", 0.006944444444444444], ["sort", 0.006944444444444444], ["quantities", 0.006944444444444444], ["offered", 0.006944444444444444], ["assured", 0.006944444444444444], ["ardently", 0.006944444444444444], ["lives", 0.006944444444444444], ["despite", 0.006944444444444444], ["women", 0.006944444444444444], ["keeping", 0.006944444444444444], ["boring", 0.006944444444444444], ["appliance", 0.006944444444444444], ["matter", 0.006944444444444444], ["propensities", 0.006944444444444444], ["stories", 0.006944444444444444], ["risks", 0.006944444444444444], ["treated", 0.006944444444444444], ["cleaner", 0.006944444444444444], ["crazy", 0.006944444444444444], ["played", 0.006944444444444444], ["mine", 0.006944444444444444], ["accept", 0.006944444444444444], ["enchanted", 0.006944444444444444], ["stroke", 0.006944444444444444], ["good", 0.006944444444444444], ["swung", 0.006944444444444444], ["grown", 0.006944444444444444], ["person", 0.006944444444444444], ["things", 0.006944444444444444], ["bowl", 0.006944444444444444], ["electrical", 0.006944444444444444], ["academy", 0.006944444444444444], ["play", 0.006944444444444444], ["mess", 0.006944444444444444], ["mechanical", 0.006944444444444444], ["margaret", 0.006944444444444444], ["commanding", 0.006944444444444444], ["device", 0.006944444444444444], ["president", 0.006944444444444444], ["law", 0.006944444444444444], ["clear", 0.006944444444444444], ["academic", 0.006944444444444444], ["vietnam", 0.006944444444444444], ["greatest", 0.006944444444444444], ["physics", 0.006944444444444444]], "sentiment": ["Our children, full-grown now, can never forgive us for reproducing. What a mess.\nI REALIZE THAT my speaking of my first and only wife as something as inhuman as a booby trap risks my seeming to be yet another infernal device. But many other women have had no trouble relating to me as a person, and ardently, too, and my interest in them has gone well beyond the merely mechanical. Almost invariably, I have been as enchanted by their souls, their intellects, and the stories of their lives as by their amorous propensities.\nBut after I came home from the Vietnam War, and before either Margaret or her mother had shown me and the children and the neighbors great big symptoms of their inherited craziness, that mother-daughter team treated me like some sort of boring but necessary electrical appliance like a vacuum cleaner.\nGOOD THINGS HAVE also happened unexpectedly, \u201cmanna from Heaven\u201d you might want to call them, but not in such quantities as to make life a bowl of cherries or anything approaching that. Right after my war, when I had no idea what to do with the rest of my life, I ran into a former commanding officer of mine who had become President of Tarkington College, in Scipio, New York. I was then only 35, and my wife was still sane, and my mother-in-law was only slightly crazy. He offered me a teaching job, which I accepted.\nI could accept that job with a clear conscience, despite my lack of academic credentials beyond a mere BS Degree from West Point, since all the students at Tarkington were learning-disabled in some way, or plain stupid or comatose or whatever. No matter what the subject, my old CO assured me, I would have little trouble keeping ahead of them.\nThe particular subject he wanted me to teach, what\u2019s more, was 1 in which I had excelled at the Academy, which was Physics.\nTHE GREATEST STROKE of luck for me, the biggest chunk of manna from Heaven, was that Tarkington had need of somebody to play the Lutz Carillon, the great family of bells at the top of the tower of the college library, where I am writing now.\nI asked my old CO if the bells were swung by ropes.\nHe said they used to be, but that they had been electrified and were played by means of a keyboard now.\n\u201cWhat does the keyboard look like?\u201d I said.", 0.03934979494190021], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["hear", 0.06666666666666667], ["fox", 0.041666666666666664], ["baker", 0.041666666666666664], ["general", 0.03333333333333333], ["groszinger", 0.03333333333333333], ["major", 0.025], ["charley", 0.016666666666666666], ["set", 0.016666666666666666], ["noise", 0.016666666666666666], ["radio", 0.016666666666666666], ["check", 0.016666666666666666], ["speaker", 0.016666666666666666], ["easy", 0.016666666666666666], ["dog", 0.016666666666666666], ["child", 0.016666666666666666], ["man", 0.016666666666666666], ["sound", 0.016666666666666666], ["perfectly", 0.016666666666666666], ["shushing", 0.016666666666666666], ["louder", 0.016666666666666666], ["crowd", 0.008333333333333333], ["destroyed", 0.008333333333333333], ["ceiling", 0.008333333333333333], ["brought", 0.008333333333333333], ["middle", 0.008333333333333333], ["farther", 0.008333333333333333], ["directly", 0.008333333333333333], ["operator", 0.008333333333333333], ["impossible", 0.008333333333333333], ["message", 0.008333333333333333], ["failed", 0.008333333333333333], ["standing", 0.008333333333333333], ["machine", 0.008333333333333333], ["microphone", 0.008333333333333333], ["cut", 0.008333333333333333], ["working", 0.008333333333333333], ["thing", 0.008333333333333333], ["dressed", 0.008333333333333333], ["comfort", 0.008333333333333333], ["fingers", 0.008333333333333333], ["long", 0.008333333333333333], ["fully", 0.008333333333333333], ["damn", 0.008333333333333333], ["experiment", 0.008333333333333333], ["crying", 0.008333333333333333], ["swore", 0.008333333333333333], ["answer", 0.008333333333333333], ["glaring", 0.008333333333333333], ["speaking", 0.008333333333333333], ["listen", 0.008333333333333333], ["chanted", 0.008333333333333333], ["shielded", 0.008333333333333333], ["eyes", 0.008333333333333333], ["finish", 0.008333333333333333], ["perplexed", 0.008333333333333333], ["attention", 0.008333333333333333], ["transmitter", 0.008333333333333333], ["stared", 0.008333333333333333], ["cot", 0.008333333333333333], ["ridiculous", 0.008333333333333333], ["lay", 0.008333333333333333], ["worked", 0.008333333333333333], ["voices", 0.008333333333333333], ["hair", 0.008333333333333333], ["kind", 0.008333333333333333], ["longer", 0.008333333333333333], ["room", 0.008333333333333333], ["trailed", 0.008333333333333333], ["light", 0.008333333333333333], ["anxiously", 0.008333333333333333], ["slender", 0.008333333333333333], ["called", 0.008333333333333333], ["blankly", 0.008333333333333333], ["matter", 0.008333333333333333], ["stopped", 0.008333333333333333], ["tangled", 0.008333333333333333], ["receiver", 0.008333333333333333], ["newspaper", 0.008333333333333333], ["dane", 0.008333333333333333], ["voice", 0.008333333333333333], ["minutes", 0.008333333333333333], ["asked", 0.008333333333333333], ["designed", 0.008333333333333333]], "sentiment": ["\u201cIs anything the matter?\u201d asked the General anxiously. \u201cYou sound as though something\u2014\u201d\nThe Major cut in before he could finish: \u201cThere!

He advanced his theories disguised as science-fiction. He died in 1981, almost twenty years after he made Dwayne Hoover so sick.\nHe was by then recognized as a great artist and scientist. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences caused a monument to be erected over his ashes. Carved in its face was a quotation from his last novel, his two-hundred-and-ninth novel, which was unfinished when he died. The monument looked like this:\n2\nDWAYNE WAS a widower. He lived alone at night in a dream house in Fairchild Heights, which was the most desirable residential area in the city. Every house there cost at least one hundred thousand dollars to build. Every house was on at least four acres of land.\nDwayne\u2019s only companion at night was a Labrador retriever named Sparky. Sparky could not wag his tail\u2014because of an automobile accident many years ago, so he had no way of telling other dogs how friendly he was. He had to fight all the time. His ears were in tatters. He was lumpy with scars.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDwayne had a black servant named Lottie Davis. She cleaned his house every day. Then she cooked his supper for him and served it. Then she went home. She was descended from slaves.\nLottie Davis and Dwayne didn\u2019t talk much, even though they liked each other a lot. Dwayne reserved most of his conversation for the dog. He would get down on the floor and roll around with Sparky, and he would say things like, \u201cYou and me, Spark,\u201d and \u201cHow\u2019s my old buddy?\u201d and so on.\nAnd that routine went on unrevised, even after Dwayne started to go crazy, so Lottie had nothing unusual to notice.", 0.07220418470418472], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["leonardo", 0.022556390977443608], ["state", 0.022556390977443608], ["trouble", 0.015037593984962405], ["perfect", 0.015037593984962405], ["prison", 0.015037593984962405], ["da", 0.015037593984962405], ["hands", 0.015037593984962405], ["lisa", 0.015037593984962405], ["side", 0.015037593984962405], ["debs", 0.015037593984962405], ["mona", 0.015037593984962405], ["agree", 0.015037593984962405], ["foreshortening", 0.015037593984962405], ["painting", 0.015037593984962405], ["lynching", 0.007518796992481203], ["ashamed", 0.007518796992481203], ["haute", 0.007518796992481203], ["marion", 0.007518796992481203], ["hanging", 0.007518796992481203], ["lethal", 0.007518796992481203], ["birthplace", 0.007518796992481203], ["paris", 0.007518796992481203], ["labor", 0.007518796992481203], ["going", 0.007518796992481203], ["dixon", 0.007518796992481203], ["pretty", 0.007518796992481203], ["smile", 0.007518796992481203], ["criminal", 0.007518796992481203], ["eugene", 0.007518796992481203], ["cultural", 0.007518796992481203], ["ferociously", 0.007518796992481203], ["ticket", 0.007518796992481203], ["easily", 0.007518796992481203], ["university", 0.007518796992481203], ["nose", 0.007518796992481203], ["art", 0.007518796992481203], ["louvre", 0.007518796992481203], ["national", 0.007518796992481203], ["hard", 0.007518796992481203], ["1926", 0.007518796992481203], ["wonder", 0.007518796992481203], ["christ", 0.007518796992481203], ["klux", 0.007518796992481203], ["1855", 0.007518796992481203], ["mason", 0.007518796992481203], ["leader", 0.007518796992481203], ["lazy", 0.007518796992481203], ["led", 0.007518796992481203], ["nationwide", 0.007518796992481203], ["free", 0.007518796992481203], ["surely", 0.007518796992481203], ["times", 0.007518796992481203], ["american", 0.007518796992481203], ["plane", 0.007518796992481203], ["suggestion", 0.007518796992481203], ["receding", 0.007518796992481203], ["features", 0.007518796992481203], ["simply", 0.007518796992481203], ["facility", 0.007518796992481203], ["sweet", 0.007518796992481203], ["railroads", 0.007518796992481203], ["jesus", 0.007518796992481203], ["americans", 0.007518796992481203], ["vote", 0.007518796992481203], ["tilted", 0.007518796992481203], ["sugar", 0.007518796992481203], ["boasts", 0.007518796992481203], ["three", 0.007518796992481203], ["france", 0.007518796992481203], ["opposed", 0.007518796992481203], ["statement", 0.007518796992481203], ["strike", 0.007518796992481203], ["indiana", 0.007518796992481203], ["borders", 0.007518796992481203], ["war", 0.007518796992481203], ["listen", 0.007518796992481203], ["lived", 0.007518796992481203], ["north", 0.007518796992481203], ["vinci", 0.007518796992481203], ["citizen", 0.007518796992481203], ["tragically", 0.007518796992481203], ["injection", 0.007518796992481203], ["true", 0.007518796992481203], ["socialist", 0.007518796992481203], ["soul", 0.007518796992481203], ["unanimous", 0.007518796992481203], ["property", 0.007518796992481203], ["site", 0.007518796992481203], ["states", 0.007518796992481203], ["cockeyed", 0.007518796992481203], ["face", 0.007518796992481203], ["stole", 0.007518796992481203], ["native", 0.007518796992481203], ["united", 0.007518796992481203], ["things", 0.007518796992481203], ["divided", 0.007518796992481203], ["answer", 0.007518796992481203], ["party", 0.007518796992481203], ["picture", 0.007518796992481203], ["indianapolis", 0.007518796992481203], ["terre", 0.007518796992481203], ["dimensions", 0.007518796992481203], ["heft", 0.007518796992481203], ["serious", 0.007518796992481203], ["klan", 0.007518796992481203], ["president", 0.007518796992481203], ["america", 0.007518796992481203], ["class", 0.007518796992481203], ["kid", 0.007518796992481203], ["lower", 0.007518796992481203], ["practically", 0.007518796992481203], ["headquarters", 0.007518796992481203], ["element", 0.007518796992481203], ["ku", 0.007518796992481203], ["african", 0.007518796992481203], ["entry", 0.007518796992481203], ["original", 0.007518796992481203]], "sentiment": ["And there is certainly nothing new about a tragically and ferociously divided United States of America, and especially here in my native state of Indiana. When I was a kid here, this state had within its borders the national headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan, and the site of the last lynching of an African-American citizen north of the Mason-Dixon Line, Marion, I think.\nBut it also had, and still has, in Terre Haute, which now boasts a state-of-the-art lethal-injection facility, the birthplace and home of the labor leader Eugene Debs. He lived from 1855 to 1926, and led a nationwide strike against the railroads. He went to prison for a while because he opposed our entry into World War One.\nAnd he ran for President several times, on the Socialist Party ticket, saying things like this: \u201cWhile there is a lower class, I am in it; while there is a criminal element, I am of it; and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\u201d\nDebs pretty much stole that from Jesus Christ. But it is so hard to be original. Tell me about it!\nBut all right, what is a statement on which all Americans can agree? \u201cSugar is sweet,\u201d certainly. But since we are on the property of a university, we can surely come up with something which has more cultural heft. And this is my suggestion: \u201cThe Mona Lisa, the picture by Leonardo da Vinci, hanging in the Louvre in Paris, France, is a perfect painting.\u201d\nOK? A show of hands, please. Can\u2019t we all agree on that?\nOK, take down your hands. I\u2019d say the vote is unanimous, that the Mona Lisa is a perfect painting. The only trouble with that, which is the trouble with practically everything we believe: It isn\u2019t true.\nListen: Her nose is tilted to the right, OK? That means the right side of her face is a receding plane, going away from us. OK? But there is no foreshortening of her features on that side, giving the effect of three dimensions. And Leonardo could so easily have done that foreshortening. He was simply too lazy to do it. And if he were Leonardo da Indianapolis, I would be ashamed of him.\nNo wonder she has such a cockeyed smile.\nAnd somebody might now want to ask me, \u201cCan\u2019t you ever be serious?\u201d The answer is, \u201cNo.\u201d", 0.2129375464602737], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
