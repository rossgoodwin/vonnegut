He could have done it only with outside help.\u201d\nWhen free will kicked in after a ten-year hiatus, Trout made the transition from d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to unlimited opportunities almost seamlessly. The rerun brought him back to the point in the space-time continuum when he was again beginning his story about the British soldier whose head was where his ding-dong should have been and whose ding-dong was where his head should have been.\nWithout warning and silently, the rerun stopped.\nThis was one heck of a moment for anyone operating a form of self-propelled transportation, or who was a passenger in one, or who stood in the path of one. For ten years, machinery, like people, had been doing whatever it had done the first time through the decade, often with fatal results, to be sure. As Trout wrote in My Ten Years on Automatic Pilot: \u201cRerun or not, modern transportation is a game of inches.\u201d The second time through, though, the hiccuping Universe, not humanity, was responsible for any and all fatalities. People might look as though they were steering something, but they weren\u2019t really steering.

Morphine overdose, self-administered for permanent relief from the pain of the same cancer that had killed his mother. His age? Exactly forty-five to the day. Berman died in his business suit and basketball shoes, with a note pinned to his regimental-stripe tie. His regiment? The Coldstream Guards. His note? It was an epitaph he recommended for himself: \u201cHe lasted three years longer in that fucking Chinese fire drill than his dad did.\u201d\nHe was indeed given that epitaph, which made history as the first instance, in modern times at least, of the word \u201cfucking\u201d being incised into a headstone. Gil Berman, one last time, in his farewell note: \u201cSymbols for fucking are nowhere to be found in the Pyramids, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Elgin Marbles, or on the Rosetta Stone.\u201d\nCHAPTER 3\nQuoting yet again from what Berman said in Northampton when he had three more years to endure: \u201cPolitical correctness has made many old-time, ethnocentric, shamelessly racist Caucasian metaphors and similes as offensive as \u2018shit,\u2019 \u2018fuck,\u2019 and \u2018asshole,\u2019 say, would be if yelled in church. Our Constitution, after all, the Law of our Land, after all, for which sailors, soldiers, marines, and coastguardspersons are paid to die, says implicitly, although, I must point out, not explicitly, that persons of color are people. So be it. I can take a hint.\u201d\nBerman paused, as though ready to take up another subject. But then, as though driven to risk all in the name of common sense and justice, let the chips fall where they may, and said: \u201cListen. I say to the nonwhites in this audience tonight, and you know who you are: \u2018Please, must American eloquence be so emasculated that no one, no matter what color, and I include yellows, can no longer use that most sublime metaphor for confusion and hysteria in stressful situations, which is \u2018Chinese fire drill\u2019? If the firepersons don\u2019t get their balls in an uproar about that expression, why should Chinks?\n\u201cListen, I will make a deal with all yellows here tonight, and may their gods give them all good things: I will give up \u2018Chinese jibe,\u2019 if I can still keep \u2018Chinese fire drill.\u2019 Sailors here, and again I don\u2019t care two pins what race they are, know a Chinese jibe is when you are sailing before the wind in a sloop, without a care in the world, and all of a sudden the wind wraps the sail around the mast like a World War I puttee. I swear on my mother\u2019s grave that I will never again say \u2018Chinese jibe,\u2019 if only I can keep on screaming, whenever there is a monster fuckup on the order of this presidential election, \u2018Chinese fire drill!\u2019\u201d\nAgain, this was the night of December 11, 2000, and the voting for the president of a nation of one-quarter billion, whether George W. Bush or Albert Gore, had been so FUBAR, so fucked-up beyond all recognition, that the justices of the United States Supreme Court were now holding a new election in private just among themselves. Berman: \u201cI don\u2019t know why we haven\u2019t let nine political appointees choose our presidents all along. No chance for a tie! And I must say I am honored that you came to hear me tonight, rather than staying home and watching the electronic tantrums on your erasers. I call TVs \u2018erasers\u2019 because they have not only wiped away the entire human experience to date, but whatever it was they were wetting their pants about only fifteen minutes earlier.\u201d\nThe last time Gil Berman himself had voted in any sort of election was when he ran against Cynthia Gottlieb for the presidency of their junior class at Knightsbridge High. Cynthia Gottlieb won, and she would eventually become, as Cynthia Gottlieb Schaffner, lieutenant governor of the State of Colorado, and then, even as Berman was performing at the Calvin, secretary of transportation under President George W. Bush. Bush, although the Supreme Court hadn\u2019t yet elected him president, was already naming members of his Cabinet. People cynical about politics were already calling Cynthia Gottlieb Schaffner \u201ca twofer\u201d: both a woman and a Jew.\nBerman said he visited Northampton\u2019s public library that afternoon, wanting to find out about Lord Jeffrey Amherst, in whose honor a nearby college and town were named. \u201cTurns out this local hero made the world safe for democracy,\u201d he said, \u201cby giving the chiefs of hostile Native American tribes blankets from the beds of Whiteskins who had smallpox.\u201d\nHe really had gone to the library that afternoon. He had discovered that the silence of a library, somehow always on the verge of uproar, could mute the twang of his need for drugs, provided he had a mission there. On his way from his hotel to the library, though, to find out who Lord Amherst was, he noticed that he was being followed by a large woman who, in his own words, \u201clooked like a driver of an eighteen-wheeler on the turnpike from Hell to Pittsburgh.\u201d He was used to being sneakily tailed by plainclothes cops who, he supposed, were hoping to get fifteen minutes of fame by jailing a celebrity. Nor had such stalkers been invariably disappointed.

MoonMist in this country,\" said Fern, \"all sterile. If one in ten sues you for damages beyond price, sues you for the modest sum of five thousand dollars\u2014the bill will be five billion dollars, excluding legal fees. And you haven\u2019t got five billion dollars. Since the stock-market crash and your acquisition of such properties as American Levitation, you aren\u2019t worth even five hundred million.\n\"MoonMist Tobacco,\" said Fern, \"that\u2019s you. Magnum Opus,\" said Fern, \"that\u2019s you, too. All the things you are are going to be sued and sued successfully. And, while the litigants may not be able to get blood from turnips, they can certainly ruin the turnips in the process of trying.\"\nFern bowed again. \"I now perform my last official duty, which is to inform you that your father wrote you a letter which was to be given to you only if your luck turned for the worse. My instructions were to place that letter under the pillow in Room 223 in the Wilburhampton, if your luck ever really turned sour. I placed the letter under the pillow an hour ago.\n\"And I will now, as an humble and loyal corporate servant, ask you for one small favor,\" said Fern. \"If the letter seems to cast the vaguest light on what life might be about, I would appreciate your telephoning me at home.\"\nRansom K. Fern saluted by touching the shaft of his cane to his Homburg hat. \"Good-by, Mr. Magnum Opus, Jr. Good-by.\"\nThe Wilburhampton Hotel was a frumpish, three-story Tudor structure across the street from the Magnum Opus Building, standing in relation to that building like an unmade bed at the feet of the Archangel Gabriel. Pine slats were tacked to the stucco exterior of the hotel, simulating half-timbered construction. The backbone of the roof had been broken intentionally, simulating great age. The eaves were plump and low, tucked under, simulated thatch. The windows were tiny, with diamond-shaped panes.\nThe hotel\u2019s small cocktail lounge was known as the Hear Ye Room.\nIn the Hear Ye Room were three people\u2014a bartender and two customers. The two customers were a thin woman and a fat man\u2014both seemingly old. Nobody in the Wilburhampton had ever seen them before, but it already seemed as though they had been sitting in the Hear Ye Room for years. Their protective coloration was perfect, for they looked half-timbered and broken-backed and thatched and little-windowed, too.\nThey claimed to be pensioned-off teachers from the same high school in the Middle West. The fat man introduced himself as George M. Helmholtz, a former bandmaster.

He said, \u201cNo.\u201d It was not a duty he felt free to delegate. He had persuaded all these celebrities to take part in the cruise, had wooed the most potent newsmakers among them as a lover might. Now he was going to have to give them the bad news personally, as a responsible lover should. At least he wouldn\u2019t have much trouble finding most of them. There were forty-two of them, counting mates or companions who were nonentities, but they had organized themselves into a few dinner parties, duly reported in gossip columns that day, in order to pass pleasantly the hours remaining until limousines came to cushion and muffle them away to Kennedy International Airport\u2014for Ecuatoriana\u2019s special ten o\u2019clock flight to Guayaquil.\nAnd at least he wouldn\u2019t have to talk about getting back their money for them. The trip wasn\u2019t to have cost them a nickel\u2014and they had already received free matched luggage and toiletries, and Panama hats besides.\nFor the sad amusement of himself and his secretary, King now played his joke with the stuffed marine iguana. He picked it up and held it alongside his head as though it were a telephone, and he said, \u201cMrs. Onassis? I am afraid I have some disappointing news for you. You\u2019re not going to get to see the courtship dance of the blue-footed boobies after all.\u201d\nKing\u2019s apologetic telephoning was a gallant formality. No one still expected to board the plane at ten that night. By ten that night, incidentally, *Andrew MacIntosh, Zenji Hiroguchi, and the Captain\u2019s brother *Siegfried would all be dead, and would all have completed their short journeys through the blue tunnel into the Afterlife.\nAll the people on the passenger list that King talked to had already made new plans for the coming two weeks. Many would go skiing within the safe boundaries of the United States instead. At one dinner party for six, everybody had already decided to go to a combination fat farm and tennis camp in Phoenix, Arizona.\nAnd the last call King made before leaving his office was to a man who had become a very close friend during the past ten months, who was Dr. Teodoro Donoso, a poet and physician from Quito, who was Ecuador\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations.

They were three separate houses again, as I already knew. They had been made separate again about the time my father died, three years before the United States got into the war. Which war? The Peloponnesian War, of course. Doesn\u2019t anybody but me remember the Peloponnesian War?\nI begin again:\nDan Gregory\u2019s mansion became three separate brownstones again soon after he and Marilee and Fred Jones left for Italy to take part in Mussolini\u2019s great social experiment. Although he and Fred were well into their fifties by then, they would ask for and receive permission from Mussolini himself to don Italian infantry officers\u2019 uniforms, but without any badges of rank or unit, and to make paintings of the Italian Army in action.\nThey would be killed almost exactly one year before the United States joined the war\u2014against Italy, by the way, and against Germany and Japan and some others. They were killed around December seventh of 1940 at Sidi Barrani, Egypt, where only thirty thousand British overwhelmed eighty thousand Italians, I learn from the Encyclopaedia Britannica, capturing forty thousand Italians and four hundred guns.\nWhen the Britannica talks about captured guns, it doesn\u2019t mean rifles and pistols. It means great big guns.\nYes, and since Gregory and his sidekick Jones were such weapons nuts, let it be said that it was Matilda tanks, and Stens and Brens and Enfield rifles with fixed bayonets which did them in.\nWhy did Marilee go to Italy with Gregory and Jones? She was in love with Gregory, and he was in love with her.\nHow is that for simplicity?\nThe easternmost house of the three which used to belong to Gregory, I only discovered on this most recent trip to New York, is now the office and dwelling of the Delegation to the United Nations of the Emirate of Salibaar. That was the first I had ever heard of the Emirate of Salibaar, which I can\u2019t find anywhere in my Encyclopaedia Britannica. I can only find a desert town by that name, population eleven thousand, about the population of San Ignacio. Circe Berman says it is time I got a new encyclopedia, and some new neckties, too.\nThe big oak door and its massive hinges are unchanged, except that the Gorgon knocker is gone.

A piece of cake.\nINTERVIEWER: Some of the characters in Cat\u2019s Cradle were based on people you knew at G.E., isn\u2019t that so?\nVONNEGUT: Dr. Felix Hoenikker, the absent-minded scientist, was a caricature of Dr. Irving Langmuir, the star of the G.E. Research Laboratory. I knew him some. My brother worked with him. Langmuir was wonderfully absent-minded. He wondered out loud one time whether, when turtles pulled in their heads, their spines buckled or contracted. I put that in the book. One time he left a tip under his plate after his wife served him breakfast at home. I put that in. His most important contribution, though, was the idea for what I called \u201cIce-9,\u201d a form of frozen water that was stable at room temperature. He didn\u2019t tell it directly to me. It was a legend around the Laboratory\u2014about the time H. G. Wells came to Schenectady. That was long before my time. I was just a little boy when it happened\u2014listening to the radio, building model airplanes.\nINTERVIEWER: Yes?\nVONNEGUT: Anyway\u2014Wells came to Schenectady, and Langmuir was told to be his host. Langmuir thought he might entertain Wells with an idea for a science-fiction story\u2014about a form of ice that was stable at room temperature. Wells was uninterested, or at least never used the idea. And then Wells died, and then, finally, Langmuir died.

twilit interior. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, with precisely the appropriate mixture of sorrow and respect, \u201cwe have reached our destination.\u201d Letters embroidered in red silk thread on his breast pocket identified his employer. \u201cRAMJAC,\u201d they said.\nAs I would learn later: Old pals of Greathouse had provided him and his lawyers with swift and secret transportation from his home to prison, so that there would be almost no witnesses to his humiliation. A limousine from Pepsi-Cola had picked him up before dawn at the service entrance to the Waldorf Towers in Manhattan, which was his home. It had taken him to the Marine Air Terminal next to La Guardia, and directly out onto a runway. A corporate jet belonging to Resorts International was waiting for him there. It flew him to Atlanta, where he was met, again right out on the runway, by a curtained limousine supplied by the Southeastern District Office of The RAMJAC Corporation.\nOut clambered Virgil Greathouse\u2014dressed almost exactly as I was, in a gray, pinstripe suit and a white shirt and a regimental-stripe tie. Our regiments were different. He was a Coldstream Guard. As always, he was sucking on his pipe. He gave me the briefest of glances.\nAnd then two sleek lawyers got out\u2014one young, one old.\nWhile the chauffeur went to the limousine\u2019s trunk to get the convict\u2019s luggage, Greathouse and the two lawyers looked over the prison as though it were a piece of real estate they were thinking of buying, if the price was right. There was a twinkle in the eyes of Greathouse, and he was imitating birdcalls with his pipe. He may have been thinking how tough he was. He had been taking lessons in boxing and jujitsu and karate, I would learn later from his lawyers, ever since it had become clear to him that he was really going to go to jail.\n\u201cWell,\u201d I thought to myself when I heard that, \u201cthere won\u2019t be anybody in that particular prison who will want to fight him, but he will get his back broken anyway. Everybody gets his back broken when he goes to prison for the first time. It mends after a while, but never quite the way it was before. As tough as Virgil Greathouse may be, he will never walk or feel quite the same again.\u201d\nVirgil Greathouse had failed to recognize me. Sitting there on the bench, I might as well have been a corpse in the mud on a battlefield, and he might have been a general who had come forward during a lull to see how things were going, by and large.\nI was unsurprised. I did think, though, that he might recognize the voice from inside the prison, which we could all hear so clearly now. It was the voice of his closest Watergate coconspirator, Emil Larkin, singing at the top of his lungs the Negro spiritual \u201cSometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.\u201d\nGreathouse had no time to show his reaction to the voice, for a fighter plane leaped up from the tip of a nearby runway, tore the sky to shreds. This was a gut-ripping sound to anyone who had not heard it and heard it and heard it before. There was never a warning build-up. It was always an end-of-the-world explosion overhead.\nGreathouse and the lawyers and the chauffeur flung themselves to the ground. Then they got up again, cursing and laughing and dusting themselves off. Greathouse, supposing correctly that he was being watched and sized up by people he could not see, made some boxing feints and looked up into the sky as though to say, clowningly, \u201cSend me another one. I\u2019m ready this time.\u201d The party did not advance on the prison, however. It waited by the limousine, expecting some sort of welcoming party. Greathouse wanted, I imagine, one last acknowledgment of his rank in society on neutral ground, a sort of surrender at Appomattox, with the warden as Ulysses S. Grant and himself as Robert E.

getting a good lay anyway but still a pretty good lay compared to no lay at all but anyway there was more to living than laying and he\u2019d like a little glory by God and there might be laying and glory overseas and while there wasn\u2019t any shooting and wasn\u2019t going to be none either probably for a good long while still you got a real gun and bullets and there was a little glory in that and sure as hell it was more grownup than marching up and down with a wooden one and he\u2019d sure like a little rank too but he knew what his I.Q. was and everybody else did too and especially the machines so that was that for twenty-three more years unless one of the machines burned out a tube and misread his card and sent him to O.C.S. and that happened now and then and there was old Mulcahy who got ahold of his card and doctored it with an icepick so the machines would think he was qualified for a big promotion but he got restricted to barracks instead for having clap twenty-six times

turning the same rusty color as the bare brick walls in the band rehearsal room. George M. Helmholtz, head of the music department and director of the band, was ringed by folding chairs and instrument cases, and on each chair sat a very young man, nervously prepared to blow through something or, in the case of the percussion section, to hit something, the instant Mr. Helmholtz lowered his white baton.\nMr. Helmholtz, a man of forty, who believed that his great belly was a sign of health, strength, and dignity, smiled angelically, as though he were about to release the most exquisite sounds ever heard by human beings. Down came his baton.\nBlooooomp! went the big sousaphones.\nBlat! Blat! echoed the French horns, and the plodding, shrieking, querulous waltz was begun.\nMr. Helmholtz\u2019s expression did not change as the brasses lost their places, as the woodwinds\u2019 nerve failed and they became inaudible rather than have their mistakes heard, while the percussion section sounded like the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\u201cA-a-a-a-ta-ta, a-a-a-a-a-a, ta-ta-ta-ta!\u201d In a loud tenor, Mr. Helmholtz sang the first-cornet part when the first cornetist, florid and perspiring, gave up and slouched in his chair, his instrument in his lap.\n\u201cSaxophones, let me hear you,\u201d called Mr. Helmholtz. \u201cGood!\u201d\nThis was the C Band, and for the C Band, the performance was good. It couldn\u2019t have been more polished for the fifth session of the school year. Most of the youngsters were just starting out as bandsmen, and in the years ahead of them they would acquire artistry enough to move into the B Band, which met the next hour. And finally the best of them would gain positions in the pride of the city, the Lincoln High School Ten Square Band.\nThe football team lost half its games and the basketball team lost two-thirds of theirs, but the band, in the ten years Mr. Helmholtz had been running it, had been second to none until the past June. It had been the first in the state to use flag twirlers, the first to use choral as well as instrumental numbers, the first to use triple-tonguing extensively, the first to march in breathtaking double time, the first to put a light in its bass drum. Lincoln High School awarded letter sweaters to the members of the A Band, and the sweaters were deeply respected, and properly so. The band had won every statewide high school band competition for ten years\u2014save the showdown in June.", 0.16372685185185185], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["dwayne", 0.07333333333333333], ["harry", 0.04666666666666667], ["transvestite", 0.03333333333333333], ["hawaiian", 0.02], ["tree", 0.02], ["clothes", 0.013333333333333334], ["concluded", 0.013333333333333334], ["transvestites", 0.013333333333333334], ["palm", 0.013333333333333334], ["showroom", 0.013333333333333334], ["city", 0.013333333333333334], ["entered", 0.013333333333333334], ["meant", 0.013333333333333334], ["week", 0.013333333333333334], ["wife", 0.013333333333333334], ["looked", 0.013333333333333334], ["green", 0.013333333333333334], ["wild", 0.006666666666666667], ["walking", 0.006666666666666667], ["cincinnati", 0.006666666666666667], ["forget", 0.006666666666666667], ["scattered", 0.006666666666666667], ["manager", 0.006666666666666667], ["fear", 0.006666666666666667], ["ground", 0.006666666666666667], ["lesabre", 0.006666666666666667], ["cut", 0.006666666666666667], ["aloha", 0.006666666666666667], ["better", 0.006666666666666667], ["suddenly", 0.006666666666666667], ["wayne", 0.006666666666666667], ["rosy", 0.006666666666666667], ["real", 0.006666666666666667], ["big", 0.006666666666666667], ["ye", 0.006666666666666667], ["underneath", 0.006666666666666667], ["basement", 0.006666666666666667], ["word", 0.006666666666666667], ["bewildered", 0.006666666666666667], ["bar", 0.006666666666666667], ["exchanged", 0.006666666666666667], ["bad", 0.006666666666666667], ["shaking", 0.006666666666666667], ["rathskeller", 0.006666666666666667], ["talked", 0.006666666666666667], ["sawed", 0.006666666666666667], ["uninhibited", 0.006666666666666667], ["burlap", 0.006666666666666667], ["nailed", 0.006666666666666667], ["suspect", 0.006666666666666667], ["free", 0.006666666666666667], ["growing", 0.006666666666666667], ["reason", 0.006666666666666667], ["subscribed", 0.006666666666666667], ["leaves", 0.006666666666666667], ["thing", 0.006666666666666667], ["magazine", 0.006666666666666667], ["top", 0.006666666666666667], ["pineapples", 0.006666666666666667], ["straw", 0.006666666666666667], ["lovable", 0.006666666666666667], ["lettuce", 0.006666666666666667], ["pole", 0.006666666666666667], ["wasn", 0.006666666666666667], ["midland", 0.006666666666666667], ["swaddled", 0.006666666666666667], ["plastic", 0.006666666666666667], ["lot", 0.006666666666666667], ["leeringly", 0.006666666666666667], ["head", 0.006666666666666667], ["club", 0.006666666666666667], ["explanation", 0.006666666666666667], ["hotel", 0.006666666666666667], ["sales", 0.006666666666666667], ["vaguely", 0.006666666666666667], ["broke", 0.006666666666666667], ["suspected", 0.006666666666666667], ["women", 0.006666666666666667], ["leotard", 0.006666666666666667], ["join", 0.006666666666666667], ["fairchild", 0.006666666666666667], ["resemble", 0.006666666666666667], ["swooned", 0.006666666666666667], ["excitement", 0.006666666666666667], ["ukuleles", 0.006666666666666667], ["grass", 0.006666666666666667], ["chemicals", 0.006666666666666667], ["beautiful", 0.006666666666666667], ["heart", 0.006666666666666667], ["telephone", 0.006666666666666667], ["skirt", 0.006666666666666667], ["pink", 0.006666666666666667], ["shirt", 0.006666666666666667], ["contest", 0.006666666666666667], ["wearing", 0.006666666666666667], ["polaroid", 0.006666666666666667], ["coconuts", 0.006666666666666667], ["unbelievable", 0.006666666666666667], ["hoover", 0.006666666666666667], ["beauty", 0.006666666666666667], ["arguing", 0.006666666666666667], ["felt", 0.006666666666666667], ["greeted", 0.006666666666666667], ["hoobler", 0.006666666666666667], ["designed", 0.006666666666666667], ["sheets", 0.006666666666666667], ["sandals", 0.006666666666666667], ["weekend", 0.006666666666666667], ["floor", 0.006666666666666667], ["blooping", 0.006666666666666667], ["spent", 0.006666666666666667], ["goodbye", 0.006666666666666667], ["pictures", 0.006666666666666667], ["hello", 0.006666666666666667]], "sentiment": ["Dwayne Hoover broke Wayne Hoobler\u2019s heart by shaking his head vaguely, then walking away.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDwayne entered his showroom. The ground wasn\u2019t blooping underneath him anymore, but now he saw something else for which there could be no explanation: A palm tree was growing out of the showroom floor. Dwayne\u2019s bad chemicals made him forget all about Hawaiian Week. Actually, Dwayne had designed the palm tree himself. It was a sawed-off telephone pole\u2014swaddled in burlap. It had real coconuts nailed to the top of it. Sheets of green plastic had been cut to resemble leaves.\nThe tree so bewildered Dwayne that he almost swooned. Then he looked around and saw pineapples and ukuleles scattered everywhere.\nAnd then he saw the most unbelievable thing of all: His sales manager, Harry LeSabre, came toward him leeringly, wearing a lettuce-green leotard, straw sandals, a grass skirt, and a pink T-shirt which looked like this:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHarry and his wife had spent all weekend arguing about whether or not Dwayne suspected that Harry was a transvestite. They concluded that Dwayne had no reason to suspect it. Harry never talked about women\u2019s clothes to Dwayne. He had never entered a transvestite beauty contest or done what a lot of transvestites in Midland City did, which was join a big transvestite club over in Cincinnati. He never went into the city\u2019s transvestite bar, which was Ye Old Rathskeller, in the basement of the Fairchild Hotel. He had never exchanged Polaroid pictures with any other transvestites, had never subscribed to a transvestite magazine.\nHarry and his wife concluded that Dwayne had meant nothing more than what he said, that Harry had better put on some wild clothes for Hawaiian Week, or Dwayne would can him.\nSo here was the new Harry now, rosy with fear and excitement.

The new sergeant had no need for an orderly, and Louis sank into the anonymity of our group. The most humiliating aspect of his new situation was the prospect of being sent out on a labor detail with the common people. He was bitter about it, and demanded an interview with the new sergeant. He got the interview and was gone for about an hour.\nWhen he got back I asked him, \u201cWell, how much does Hitler want for Berchtesgaden?\u201d\nLouis was carrying a parcel wrapped in toweling. He opened it to reveal two pairs of scissors, some clippers, and a razor. \u201cI\u2019m the camp barber,\u201d he announced. \u201cBy order of the camp commandant, I am to make you gentlemen presentable.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want you to cut my hair?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThen you get your rations cut in half. That\u2019s by order of the commandant, too.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mind telling us how you got this appointment?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNot at all, not at all,\u201d said Louis. \u201cI just told him I was ashamed to be associated with a bunch of sloppy men who look like gangsters, and that he ought to be ashamed to have such a terrible bunch in his prison. We two, the commandant and I, are going to do something about it.\u201d He set a stool in the middle of the floor and motioned me toward it. \u201cYou\u2019re first, kid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe commandant noticed those long locks of yours, and told me to be sure and get \u2019em.\u201d\nI sat down on the stool and he whisked a towel around my neck. There was no mirror in which I could watch him cut, but his operations felt professional enough. I remarked on his unsuspected skill as a barber.\n\u201cNothing, really,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I surprise myself.\u201d He finished with the clippers. \u201cThat will be two cigarettes, or the equivalent,\u201d he said. I paid him in saccharine tablets. No one but Louis had any cigarettes.\n\u201cWant a look at yourself?\u201d He handed me a fragment of mirror. \u201cNot bad, eh? And the best thing about it is that it\u2019s probably the worst job I\u2019ll do, because I\u2019m bound to improve with time.\u201d", -0.05114607614607614], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
