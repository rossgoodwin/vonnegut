He was totally bald, and went naked most of the time, wearing nothing but a neatly-trimmed, white vandyke beard.\nHe lived in Salo\u2019s grounded space ship, had been living there for thirty years.\nConstant had not tried to fly the space ship. He hadn\u2019t dared to touch a single control. The controls of Salo\u2019s ship were far more complex than those of a Martian ship. Salo\u2019s dash panel offered Constant two hundred and seventy-three knobs, switches, and buttons, each with a Tralfamadorian inscription or calibration. The controls were anything but a hunch-player\u2019s delight in a Universe composed of one-trillionth part matter to one decillion parts black velvet futility.\nConstant had tinkered with the ship only to the extent of finding out gingerly if, as Rumfoord had said, Chrono\u2019s good-luck piece really would serve as a part of the power plant.\nSuperficially, at any rate, the good-luck piece would. There was an access door to the ship\u2019s power plant that had plainly leaked smoke at one time. Constant opened it, found a sooty compartment within. And under the soot were smudged bearings and cams that related to nothing.\nConstant was able to slip the holes in Chrono\u2019s good-luck piece onto those bearings and between the cams. The good-luck piece conformed to close tolerances and surrounding clearances in a way that would have pleased a Swiss machinist.\nConstant had many hobbies that helped him to pass the balmy time in the salubrious clime of Titan.\nHis most interesting hobby was puttering around with Salo, the dismantled Tralfamadorian messenger. Constant spent thousands of hours trying to get Salo back together and going again.\nSo far, he had had no luck.", 0.13604497354497355], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["glassy", 0.05555555555555555], ["angela", 0.05555555555555555], ["smile", 0.05555555555555555], ["frank", 0.05555555555555555], ["bought", 0.05555555555555555], ["moment", 0.037037037037037035], ["turned", 0.018518518518518517], ["110", 0.018518518518518517], ["fourteenth", 0.018518518518518517], ["left", 0.018518518518518517], ["door", 0.018518518518518517], ["contempt", 0.018518518518518517], ["arms", 0.018518518518518517], ["going", 0.018518518518518517], ["slammed", 0.018518518518518517], ["monzano", 0.018518518518518517], ["told", 0.018518518518518517], ["week", 0.018518518518518517], ["wouldn", 0.018518518518518517], ["sneeringly", 0.018518518518518517], ["returned", 0.018518518518518517], ["mess", 0.018518518518518517], ["papa", 0.018518518518518517], ["midget", 0.018518518518518517], ["hands", 0.018518518518518517], ["russian", 0.018518518518518517], ["cape", 0.018518518518518517], ["nasty", 0.018518518518518517], ["wanted", 0.018518518518518517], ["newt", 0.018518518518518517], ["man", 0.018518518518518517], ["sister", 0.018518518518518517], ["cod", 0.018518518518518517], ["tomcat", 0.018518518518518517], ["job", 0.018518518518518517], ["book", 0.018518518518518517], ["stopped", 0.018518518518518517], ["husband", 0.018518518518518517], ["clean", 0.018518518518518517], ["pried", 0.018518518518518517], ["asked", 0.018518518518518517], ["talk", 0.018518518518518517], ["shook", 0.018518518518518517]], "sentiment": ["Angela stopped him. \u201cHow could you?\u201d she wanted to know.\nFrank gave her a glassy smile. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d\n\u201cHow could you give it to a man like \u2018Papa\u2019 Monzano?\u201d Angela asked him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s clean up the mess first; then we can talk.\u201d\nAngela had him by the arms, and she wouldn\u2019t let him go. \u201cHow could you!\u201d She shook him.\nFrank pried his sister\u2019s hands from himself.

York City\nTO DONALD FIENE\nDear Don\u2014\nThe essay about me and the Soviet Union [by Donald Fiene] is a careful and friendly piece of work. I honestly did not know until now that I had such a reputation over there. I am moved. If the New York Review, which has never been kind to me, publishes the piece, my reputation and self-esteem will soar.\nI once conceived of an experiment in which every piece of information received by a human being would be entered in a log\u2014from birth to the age of twenty-one, say. We would then be able to determine whether that person had also inherited certain knowledge, or perhaps received it telepathically or clairvoyantly. If that experiment had been performed on me, it would be obvious that I am not an educated man. I haven\u2019t read nearly all I should. As a chemist, and then as an engineer, and then as an anthropologist, I was kept busy reading, all right. But what I read was not what is customarily thought of as being literature. The only period in my life when I studied literature with some concentration and continuity was when I was a discussion leader in a Great Books group on Cape Cod for about three years\u2014when I was in my middle thirties. People have urged me to read this or that from time to time, and I have usually obeyed them and been grateful. Thus I discovered Blake and C\u00e9line and Edward Lewis Wallant, and on and on. As for the Russians: My wife had studied them intensively at Swarthmore, and she brought about twenty volumes of their work in Modern Library editions as the core of her dowry. So I read them, and in my heart I liked Gogol best. The quotation about \u201cOne sacred memory \u2026\u201d, incidentally, was handed on a slip of paper to my wife at the end of her course at Swarthmore. The teacher was an adored old man, Harold Goddard, who customarily made a gift of a quotation to each student at semester\u2019s end. Jane still has the piece of paper. The author is named, but not the book it came from. Jane herself does not know.\nThe quote may be as hard to find as a quotation from Goethe, which was framed and hanging on my father\u2019s office wall for years, and which I incorporated into an early short story. In English it goes: \u201cThe gods, the eternal ones, give everything to their darlings, all the joys, the eternal ones, all the agonies, the eternal ones\u2014everything.\u201d When Collier\u2019s asked me where this came from, I referred the question to my father. He said it was a famous quotation, and could be run down in a half an hour or less. Weeks later, he had dozens of frantic Germans ransacking the libraries of Indianapolis, and having no luck at all. It turned out to be a postscript to a letter from Goethe to an obscure friend.\nAs for how things go now with Rita: Three weeks ago I sent her a copy of Jill\u2019s beautiful new ballet book\u2014airmail, first class. I enclosed a letter telling her that she was about to be invited to the University of Tennessee. Five days ago, a rather mournful letter drifted in from her, asking why Jill and I don\u2019t write to her any more.\nStanley Kunitz says they will never let her out. They are afraid she will have too much fun and start talking too much. My spook friend is having lunch with a Russian contact next week. The contact is just back from Moscow, and promises to tell how things really stand with Rita. He has been looking into it hard, he says.
