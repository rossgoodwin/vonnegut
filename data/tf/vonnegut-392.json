Chalk that up as another miracle. So the two-thousandth year of the Christian era was 1995, and the long-awaited apocalypse was the O.J. Simpson case.\nCheers\u2014\nKurt\nFebruary 23, 1998\nNew York City\nTO MILLER HARRIS\nDear Miller\u2014\n[\u2026] Ancestors of the Jews I grew up with in Indianapolis came over the same time yours and mine did, and so missed the harrowing romance of Ellis Island and the sweatshops and all that. They were just more Germans who didn\u2019t want to be Europeans any more, who wanted to be defined by the Declaration of Independence, and also get rich. The first Vonnegut to hit Indianapolis was wearing silk and selling silk, so he might as well have been Jewish.\nIn the over-achievers\u2019 high school I attended, we Gentiles considered the Jews, children of established professionals and businessmen, to be on the lunatic fringe of Christianity, trying to get through life with only half a Bible. One of them was Madelyn Pugh, who became head writer on The I Love Lucy Show. Many of their ancestors, again like my own, had been Freethinkers, for whom Origin of the Species was holy writ.\nThe Unitarian minister who buried my father (because he was dead) was Jack Mendelsohn, who later had a church in Boston. It offered sanctuary to draft resisters during the Vietnam War and lost its fire insurance.", 0.24439393939393939], "title": "Letters"}}
