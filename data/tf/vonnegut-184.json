Redwine read it to his flock on the first Sunday of every month.\n\" \u2019I am not your father,\u2019 \" said Redwine. \" \u2019Rather call me brother. But I am not your brother. Rather call me son.

He paused by the puddle under the bell rope, looked up to divine the course the water had taken down. It was a lovely way, he decided, for spring rain to come in. If ever he were in charge of remodeling the church, he would make sure that enterprising drops of rain could still come in that way.\nJust beyond the arch under the steeple was another arch, a leafy arch of lilacs.\nRedwine now stepped under that second arch, saw the space ship like a great blister in the woods, saw the naked, bearded Space Wanderer in his churchyard.\nRedwine cried out for joy.

\u2022\nListen: That Doberman\u2019s name was Kazak. He patrolled the supply yard of the Maritimo Brothers Construction Company at night. Kazak\u2019s trainers, the people who explained to him what sort of a planet he was on and what sort of an animal he was, taught him that the Creator of the Universe wanted him to kill anything he could catch, and to eat it, too.\nIn an earlier version of this book, I had Benjamin Davis, the black husband of Lottie Davis, Dwayne Hoover\u2019s maid, take care of Kazak. He threw raw meat down into the pit where Kazak lived in the daytime. He dragged Kazak into the pit at sunrise. He screamed at him and threw tennis balls at him at sundown. Then he turned him loose.\nBenjamin Davis was first trumpet with the Midland City Symphony Orchestra, but he got no pay for that, so he needed a real job. He wore a thick gown made of war-surplus mattresses and chicken wire, so Kazak could not kill him. Kazak tried and tried. There were chunks of mattress and swatches of chicken wire all over the yard.\nAnd Kazak did his best to kill anybody who came too close to the fence which enclosed his planet. He leaped at people as though the fence weren\u2019t there. The fence bellied out toward the sidewalk everywhere. It looked as though somebody had been shooting cannonballs at it from inside.\nI should have noticed the queer shape of the fence when I got out of my automobile, when I did the soign\u00e9 thing of lighting a cigarette. I should have known that a character as ferocious as Kazak was not easily cut out of a novel.\nKazak was crouching behind a pile of bronze pipe which the Maritimo Brothers had bought cheap from a hijacker earlier that day. Kazak meant to kill and eat me.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI turned my back to the fence, took a deep puff of my cigarette. Pall Malls would kill me by and by. And I mooned philosophically at the murky battlements of the old Keedsler Mansion, on the other side of Fairchild Boulevard.\nBeatrice Keedsler had been raised in there. The most famous murders in the city\u2019s history had been committed there. Will Fairchild, the war hero, and the maternal uncle of Beatrice Keedsler, appeared one summer night in 1926 with a Springfield rifle. He shot and killed five relatives, three servants, two policemen, and all the animals in the Keedslers\u2019 private zoo.

town but me.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe were allowed into Midland City in order to photograph and make lists of all the items of personal property which were certainly ours, or which might be ours, or which we thought we might inherit, once all the legal technicalities were unscrambled. As I say, we weren\u2019t allowed to actually touch anything. The penalty for trying to smuggle anything out of the flash area, no matter how worthless, was twenty years in prison for civilians. For soldiers, the penalty was death.\nAs I say, the security was quite wonderful, and we heard many visitors who had certainly been more horribly bereaved than we were praise the military for its smart appearance and efficiency. It was almost as though Midland City were at last being run the way it should have been run all along.\nBut, as we were to discover on the morning of our third and final day, where the minefield outside the fence ended, highly treasonous opinion of the Federal Government began. The farmers on the fringe of the flash area, in the past as politically inert as mastodons, had been turned into bughouse social commentators by the flash.\nThey had lost their shopping centers, of course.\nSo Felix and I and Ketchum and Hippolyte Paul were having breakfast at the Quality Motor Court out by Sacred Miracle Cave, where we were staying, and where our purple school bus would pick us up, and two farmers in bib overalls, just like old John Fortune in Katmandu, were passing out leaflets in the coffee shop. The Quality Motor Court was not then under martial law. I understand that all motels within fifty miles of Midland City have now been placed under martial law.\nThese two said the same thing over and over again as they offered their leaflets: \u201cRead the truth and then write your congressman.\u201d About half the customers refused to even look at the leaflets, but we each took one.\nThe organization which wanted us to write our congressmen, it turned out, was \u201cFarmers of Southwestern Ohio for Nuclear Sanity.\u201d They said that it was all well and good that the Federal Government should be making idealistic plans for Midland City, as a haven for refugees from less fortunate countries or whatever. But they also felt that there should be some public discussion, that \u201cthe veil of silence should be lifted\u201d from the mystery of how all the previous inhabitants had wound up under the municipal parking lot.\nThey confessed that they were fighting a losing battle in trying to make anybody outside of southwestern Ohio care what had happened to someplace called \u201cMidland City.\u201d As far as the farmers knew, Midland City had never even been mentioned on a major network television show until after the flash.

It\u2019s just nice to know that there will be more than just black velvet silence out there, that a pleasant and interesting letter will drift in from time to time.\nYou\u2019re learning now that you do not inhabit a solid, reliable social structure\u2014that the older people around you are worried, moody, goofy human beings who themselves were little kids only a few days ago. So home can fall apart and schools can fall apart, usually for childish reasons\u2014and what have you got? A space wanderer named Nan.\nAnd that\u2019s O.K. I\u2019m a space wanderer named Kurt, and Jane\u2019s a space wanderer named Jane, and so on. When things go well for days on end, it is an hilarious accident.\nYou are dismayed at having lost a year, maybe, because the school fell apart. Well\u2014I feel as though I\u2019ve lost the years since Slaughterhouse-Five was published, but that\u2019s malarky. Those years weren\u2019t lost. They simply weren\u2019t the way I\u2019d planned them. Neither was the year in which Jim had to stay motionless in bed while he got over TB. Neither was the year in which Mark went crazy, then put himself together again. Those years were adventures. Planned years are not.\nI look back on my own life, and I wouldn\u2019t change anything, not even the times when I was raging drunk. I don\u2019t drink much any more, by the way. And a screwy thing is happening, without any encouragement from anywhere\u2014I am eating less and less meat.\nOther ideas which seem good to me appear uninvited\u2014when I\u2019m alone, and I\u2019m alone a lot. I love being alone sometimes. And one of those ideas is that you are a European, were probably born one. Europe, maybe Austria, is in your DNA. I see you going to the art school where young Ted Rowley is now this coming summer. You will become fluent in German and then French. And maybe you\u2019ll get me over there. Maybe that\u2019s where I belong, too. We\u2019d live in separate houses, of course. Probably separate countries, even. I wouldn\u2019t barge in on you and stay.\nI think it\u2019s important to live in a nice country rather than a powerful one. Power makes everybody crazy.\nLearn German during your last semester at Sea Pines, and you\u2019ll learn more than I ever learned in high school. I doubt that they can get you in shape to cool the college boards, so the hell with the college boards. Educate yourself instead. In the final analysis, that\u2019s what I had to do, what Uncle Beaver had to do, what we all have to do.\nI am going to order you to do something new, if you haven\u2019t done it already. Get a collection of the short stories of Chekhov and read every one. Then read \u201cYouth\u201d by Joseph Conrad. I\u2019m not suggesting that you do these things.

George wasn\u2019t worried about being killed. He didn\u2019t think Gratz had any way of finding him in his room over the garage of the dean of the Divinity School. George had trouble believing that the adventure in the jail had even happened.\nThere was a picture in the paper one day, showing Gloria St. Pierre leaving the jail with Gratz. George didn\u2019t believe either one was real.\nAnd then, one night, he was reading The Encyclopedia of Criminology. He was looking for clues that would help him to understand the life Gloria St. Pierre had chosen to lead. The Encyclopedia, all-inclusive as it tried to be, said not one word about why such a beautiful, intelligent girl should have thrown her life away on such ugly, greedy, cruel men.\nThere was a knock on the door.\nGeorge opened the door, found two unfamiliar young men standing outside. One of them said George\u2019s name politely, read it and his address from a piece of paper torn from a pack of cigarettes. It was the piece of paper on which Gloria St. Pierre had started to write George\u2019s biography, The Thrilling Life Story of Mr. Z.\nGeorge recognized it a split second before the two men started beating the stuffing out of him. They called him \u201cProfessor\u201d every time they hit him. They didn\u2019t seem mad at all.\nBut they knew their business. George went to the hospital with four broken ribs, two broken ankles, a split ear, a closed eye, and a headful of orioles.\n* * *\nThe next morning, George sat in his hospital bed and tried to write his parents a letter. \u201cDear Mother and Father:\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m in the hospital, but you mustn\u2019t worry.\u201d\nHe was wondering what to say beyond that, when a platinum blonde with eyelashes like buggy whips came in.
