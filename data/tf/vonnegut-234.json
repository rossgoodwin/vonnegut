I was not then a member, and was terrified. I had left home, and was spending most of my time counting flowers on the wall and watching Captain Kangaroo in a tiny apartment on East Fifty-fourth Street. My friend with the gambling sickness had just cleaned out my bank account and my son had gone insane in British Columbia.\nI asked my wife please not to come, since I was rattled enough as it was. I asked a woman with whom I had been keeping company some not to come, either\u2014for the same reason. So they both came, all dressed up for a fancy execution.\nWhat saved my life? Pieces of paper eight and a half inches wide and eleven inches long.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI am sorry for people who have no knack for reducing to seeming order some little thing. More and more people are doing it with film and video tape these days. My chief objection to motion pictures as art is their expensiveness. A filmmaker is like Benvenuto Cellini, who worked with raw materials which were priceless to begin with\u2014with silver and platinum and gold.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI was born into a house which was designed and built by my father in 1922, the year of my birth. It was so full of treasures that it was like a museum, and it was meant to be inherited by my brother, my sister, or me. I would not like to live there. Edwardian lives of a sort were conducted there for seven years. That isn\u2019t a long period of time, you know. To my parents, who were great lovers of music, it must have been as though a full orchestra had played the first seven bars of a symphony, and then gone home.\nThe house I now inhabit was built in this busy seaport by a speculator named L. S. Brooks in 1860-61, at the outbreak of the Civil War. Spiritually, it is as much my house as anyone\u2019s, since Brooks built it, along with a lot of other ones just like it in this neighborhood, with no inhabitant in particular in mind.\nThe first person who liked it enough to move into it, the way a hermit crab might move into an empty snail shell, was another German, Ferdinand Traud. He was president of the German Free School down at 142 East Fourth Street.\nThe Trauds moved out in 1875, and Julius Bruno, a broker, moved in. Julius Bruno moved out in 1887, and Peter Goetz moved in. Peter Goetz moved out in 1891, and Louisa Gerlach moved in.

He\u2019d started it. He\u2019d just been offered two million dollars for it by the General Forge and Foundry Company. He didn\u2019t have any stockholders and he didn\u2019t owe a dime. He was fifty-one, a widower, and he had one heir\u2014a son. The boy\u2019s name was Franklin. The boy was named for Benjamin Franklin.\nOne Friday afternoon father and son went out of Merle\u2019s office and into the factory. They walked down a factory aisle to Rudy Linberg\u2019s lathe.\n\u201cRudy,\u201d said Merle, \u201cthe boy here\u2019s home from college for three days, and I thought maybe you and him and your boy and me might go out to the farm and shoot some clay pigeons tomorrow.\u201d\nRudy turned his sky-blue eyes to Merle and young Franklin. He was Merle\u2019s age, and he had the deep and narrow dignity of a man who had learned his limitations early\u2014who had never tried to go beyond them. His limitations were those of his tools, his flute, and his shotgun.\n\u201cMight try crows,\u201d he said.\nRudy stood at attention like the good soldier he was. And like an old soldier, he did it without humility, managed to convey that he was the big winner in life, after all. He had been Merle\u2019s first employee. He might have been a partner way back then, for two thousand dollars. And Rudy\u2019d had the cash. But the enterprise had looked chancy to him. He didn\u2019t seem sorry now.\n\u201cWe could set up my owl,\u201d said Rudy. He had a stuffed owl to lure crows. He and his son, Karl, had made it.\n\u201cNeed a rifle to get at the crows out there,\u201d said Merle. \u201cThey know all about that owl of yours and Karl\u2019s. Don\u2019t think we could get any closer to \u2019em than half a mile.\u201d\n\u201cMight be sport, trying to get at \u2019em with a scope,\u201d said Franklin softly. He was tall and thin, in cashmere and gray flannel. He was almost goofy with shyness and guilt. He had just told his father that he wanted to be an actor, that he didn\u2019t want the factory. And shock at his own words had come so fast that he\u2019d heard himself adding, out of control, the hideously empty phrase, \u201cThanks just the same.\u201d", 0.10935672514619883], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
