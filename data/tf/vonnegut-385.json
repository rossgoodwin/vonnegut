Somebody awake?\u201d\nA faint hubbub came from around a corner, from where the railroad station had been, where it still was after a fashion. Finnerty turned the corner for a better look at the celebrators.\nIn the station\u2019s waiting room, carnage was everywhere. The terrazzo floor, depicting an earlier slaughter of Iliumites by Oneida Indians, was strewn with the guts and internal secretions of the automatic ticket vendor, the automatic nylon vendor, the automatic coffee vendor, the automatic newspaper vendor, the automatic toothbrush vendor, the automatic shoeshine machine, the automatic photo studio, the automatic baggage checker, the automatic insurance salesman \u2026\nBut around one machine a group had gathered. The people were crowding one another excitedly, as though a great wonder were in their midst.\nPaul and Finnerty left the car to examine the mystery, and saw that the center of attention was an Orange-O machine. Orange-O, Paul recalled, was something of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, for no one in the whole country, apparently, could stomach the stuff\u2014no one save Doctor Francis Eldgrin Gelhorne, National Industrial, Commercial, Communications, Foodstuffs, and Resources Director. As a monument to him, Orange-O machines stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the rest, though the coin-box collectors never found anything in the machines but stale Orange-O.\nBut now the excretor of the blended wood pulp, dye, water, and orange-type flavoring was as popular as a nymphomaniac at an American Legion convention.\n\u201cO.K., now let\u2019s try anotha\u2019 nickel in her an\u2019 see how

there, and Indianapolis history as well, by naming it what it is not, Victorian Mansion.\nIt is not of the Victorian era, nor was it inspired in the least by architecture of that time. To call it Victorian, then, would be to proclaim that the Junior League is indifferent to the truth, and moreover insensitive to important distinctions in the fine arts, which include architecture. So what else is new?\nOn November 17th of last year, I, of Shortridge High School, and the world-renowned architect Michael Graves, of Broad Ripple High School, held an informal but public discussion about architecture and a sense of place. A person in the audience asked us, apropos of nothing he or I had said, why Indianapolis had an inferiority complex. Your organization gives me an answer I wish I\u2019d had back then: It knows nothing of its past, which is in fact neither shameful nor boring, and so destroys even the most beautiful and imposing proofs that it ever had one.\nFor your information, and you surely know this already: 3050 North Meridian Street was a brilliantly conceived machine for genteel living, designed by my grandfather Bernard Vonnegut, an Indianapolis native educated in Europe and at MIT, the first licensed architect in the State of Indiana. The Athenaeum, a National Landmark, was designed by him.\nThe former Confederate States are proud of grand houses where the owners held really swell parties and family reunions and weddings and so on, and have made them tourist attractions.\nTerrific celebrations were held, and in my time, too, in the Schnull\u2013Rauch house. Indianapolis is going to deny, with the help of the Junior League, that people whose names were known lived happier and more gracious and productive lives on North Meridian than Scarlett O\u2019Hara lived at Tara?\nWe haven\u2019t been in a movie? Is that the problem?\nGiving a piece of property a supposedly cute or quaint name, in the hopes of increasing its market value, is an act typical of a very average real estate broker anywhere in the world. Perhaps Indianapolis deserves its inferiority complex after all, since it is rapidly becoming nothing but a real estate development and a so-so football team stolen from Baltimore.\nVery truly yours\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut (Jr.)", 0.16793323863636364], "title": "Letters"}}
