She later returned to Dell as president and publisher.\nDear Don\u2014\nI am especially sorry to be a lazy correspondent in your case, since you never send me anything but first rate material. You find time to be vivid in real life. Somehow I don\u2019t, and most novelists don\u2019t. Such is the territory. A novel is an enormous ball of cotton batting which sops up thousands of hours, giving almost nothing but a little lint in return. Fuck all.\nAs for the unbelievable scheme for the hero\u2019s getting information out of Germany in Mother Night: I hated it myself, but thought I had better not waste time fixing it, since the magazines had just gone out of business, and I was suddenly in the position of having to write a whole book in order to get what used to be my fee for just one story. Oh, well\u2014people seem to find clunky flaws like that endearing. My friend John Updike, who was called \u201cthe perfect a-plus student\u201d by James Dickey, would never make mistakes like that, and so may seem inhuman.\nI am certainly trying to be more careful with the book about fictitious abstract expressionist painters I am now working on. I can afford to be. I am understandably uneasy just now about who might like the book, who I am writing it for, since my great editor at Dell, Carole Baron, left suddenly for a more congenial situation at St. Martin\u2019s. She left because Doubleday, which bought Dell and me for 35 million bucks, is in the process of liquidation, the Doubleday heirs never having cared much for books, and having let their legacy sink slowly back into the primordial ooze. I am the one name author still listed among their assets, and am presently acting in the worst possible faith in order to break my contract.

Besides, you look feverish.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been taking a long, hard look at my life, is all,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, do you want the business or not?\u201d\n\u201cThe storm window business is based on common sense, and I\u2019d just as soon keep it that way,\u201d I replied. \u201cThat old ell of yours hasn\u2019t had any work done on it for I\u2019ll bet fifty years. The clapboards are loose, the sills are shot, and the wind whistles through the gaps in the foundation. You might as well put storm windows on a shredded wheat biscuit.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m having it restored,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIs Sheila expecting a baby?\u201d\nHe narrowed his eyes. \u201cI sincerely hope not,\u201d he said, \u201cfor her sake, for my sake, and for the sake of the child.\u201d\nI had lunch that day at the drugstore. About half of Lovers Anonymous had lunch at the drugstore. When I sat down, Selma Deal, the woman back of the counter, said, \u201cWell, you great lover, got a quorum now. What you gonna vote about?\u201d\nHay Boyden, the house mover and wrecker, turned to me. \u201cAny new business, Mr. President?\u201d", 0.10716245559995558], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"},

wife had a girl. You can see the baby in about twenty minutes.\"\n\"I know, I know, I know,\" said Mr. Sousa, a sullen gorilla, plainly impatient with having a tiresome and familiar routine explained to him. He snapped his fingers. \"Girl! Seven, now. Seven girls I got now. A houseful of women. I can beat the stuffings out of ten men my own size. But, what do I get? Girls.\"\n\"Mr. Knechtmann,\" said the nurse to the other man in the room. She pronounced the name, as almost all Americans did, a colorless Netman. \"I\u2019m sorry. Still no word on your wife. She is keeping us waiting, isn\u2019t she?\" She grinned glassily and left.\nSousa turned on Knechtmann. \"Some little son of a gun like you, Netman, you want a boy, bing! You got one. Want a football team, bing, bing, bing, eleven, you got it.\" He stomped out of the room.\nThe man he left behind, all alone now, was Heinz Knechtmann, a presser in a dry-cleaning plant, a small man with thin wrists and a bad spine that kept him slightly hunched, as though forever weary. His face was long and big-nosed and thin-lipped, but was so overcast with good-humored humility as to be beautiful. His eyes were large and brown, and deep-set and long-lashed. He was only twenty-two, but seemed and felt much older. He had died a little as each member of his family had been led away and killed by the Nazis, until only in him, at the age of ten, had life and the name of Knechtmann shared a soul. He and his wife, Avchen, had grown up behind barbed wire.\nHe had been staring at the walls of the waiting room for twelve hours now, since noon, when his wife\u2019s labor pains had become regular, the surges of slow rollers coming in from the sea a mile apart, from far, far away. This would be his second child. The last time he had waited, he had waited on a straw tick in a displaced-persons camp in Germany. The child, Karl Knechtmann, named after Heinz\u2019s father, had died, and with it, once more, had died the name of one of the finest cellists ever to have lived.\nWhen the numbness of weary wishing lifted momentarily during this second vigil, Heinz\u2019s mind was a medley of proud family names, gone, all gone, that could be brought to life again in this new being\u2014if it lived. Peter Knechtmann, the surgeon; Kroll Knechtmann, the botanist; Friederich Knechtmann, the playwright. Dimly recalled uncles. Or if it was a girl, and if it lived, it would be Helga Knechtmann, Heinz\u2019s mother, and she would learn to play the harp as Heinz\u2019s mother had, and for all Heinz\u2019s ugliness, she would be beautiful. The Knechtmann men were all ugly, the Knechtmann women were all lovely as angels, though not all angels. It had always been so\u2014for hundreds and hundreds of years.\n\"Mr. Netman,\" said the nurse, \"it\u2019s a boy, and your wife is fine. She\u2019s resting now. You can see her in the morning. You can see the baby in twenty minutes.\"\nHeinz looked up dumbly.", 0.00034612237356142727], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
