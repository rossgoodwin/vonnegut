I am plumb out of relatives out that way.\nCheers,\nKurt Vonnegut\nUndated, Spring, 1990\n[New York City]\nTO BEN HITZ\nDear old Ben\u2014\n[\u2026] I have always felt honored by your friendship, since you are so intelligent and kind and funny, and extraordinarily well informed. I am an enemy of Popes, and particularly of the present incumbent, but surely not of the Catholic Church, the Family of Man. Trained in agnosticism and the social sciences, I find superficial and obvious explanations for whatever whenever possible. So I celebrate your finally responding to the hideous and low comedy historical glitch represented by the unspeakable Henry the Eighth and all that, stinking of nationalism, and rejoining, again, the Family of Man.\nI am now, because of my age and steadfast lack of faith, at least a Bishop in my own religion, German Freethinking, and am, in fact, treated as a peer by the likes of Paul Moore, who has become one of my closest friends. I also get along fine with Jesuits. It wasn\u2019t until I was sixty-four that I came across a statement by Nietzsche that I could articulate why committed Christians and Jews sometimes find me respectable: \u201cOnly a person of deep faith can afford the luxury of skepticism.\u201d\nCheers, and love to you, too.
