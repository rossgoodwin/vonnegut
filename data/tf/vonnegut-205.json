He had been the captive of many things in his troubled times. He was now a captive of a crowd that thought he was a marvel. \"They\u2019ve certainly been wonderful,\" he said, in reply to Rumfoord\u2019s last question. \"They\u2019ve been grand.\"\n\"Oh\u2014they\u2019re a grand bunch,\" said Rumfoord. \"No mistake about that. I\u2019ve been racking my brains for the right word to describe them, and you\u2019ve brought it to me from outer space. Grand is what they are.\" Rumfoord\u2019s mind was plainly elsewhere. He wasn\u2019t much interested in the Space Wanderer as a person\u2014 hardly looked at him. Neither did he seem very excited about the approach of the Space Wanderer\u2019s wife and child.\n\"Where are they, where are they?\" said Rumfoord to an assistant below. \"Let\u2019s get on with it. Let\u2019s get it over with.\"\nThe Space Wanderer was finding his adventures so satisfying and stimulating, so splendidly staged, that he was shy about asking questions\u2014was afraid that asking questions might make him seem ungrateful.\nHe realized that he had a terrific ceremonial responsibility and that the best thing to do was to keep his mouth shut, to speak only when spoken to, and to make his answers to all questions short and artless.\nThe Space Wanderer\u2019s mind did not teem with questions. The fundamental structure of his ceremonial situation was obvious\u2014was as clean and functional as a three-legged milking stool. He had suffered mightily, and now he was being rewarded mightily.\nThe sudden change in fortunes made a bang-up show. He smiled, understanding the crowd\u2019s delight\u2014 pretending to be in the crowd himself, sharing the crowd\u2019s delight.\nRumfoord read the Space Wanderer\u2019s mind. \"They\u2019d like it just as much the other way around, you know,\" he said.\n\"The other way around?\" said the Space Wanderer. \"If the big reward came first, and then the great suffering,\" said Rumford. \"It\u2019s the contrast they like. The order of events doesn\u2019t make any difference to them. It\u2019s the thrill of the fast reverse\u2014\"\nRumfoord opened his fist, exposed the microphone. With his other hand he beckoned pontifically. He was beckoning to Bee and Chrono, who had been hoisted onto a tributary of the gilded system of catwalks, ramps, ladders, pulpits, steps, and stages. \"This way, please.

before H-hour the radios announced that the rockets were ready, that the observation ships had backed away to what was thought to be a safe distance, and that the bombers were on their way. The small Virginia audience lined up on the bench in order of rank, smoked a great deal, and said little. Professor Barnhouse was in his bedroom. General Barker bustled about the house like a woman preparing Thanksgiving dinner for twenty.\nAt ten minutes before H-hour the general came in, shepherding the professor before him. The professor was comfortably attired in sneakers, gray flannels, a blue sweater, and a white shirt open at the neck. The two of them sat side by side on the love seat. The general was rigid and perspiring; the professor was cheerful. He looked at each of the screens, lighted a cigarette and settled back.\n\"Bombers sighted!\" cried the Aleutian observers.\n\"Rockets away!\" barked the New Mexico radio operator.\nAll of us looked quickly at the big electric clock over the mantel, while the professor, a half-smile on his face, continued to watch the television sets. In hollow tones, the general counted away the seconds remaining. \"Five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... Concentrate!\"\nProfessor Barnhouse closed his eyes, pursed his lips, and stroked his temples. He held the position for a minute. The television images were scrambled, and the radio signals were drowned in the din of Barnhouse static. The professor sighed, opened his eyes, and smiled confidently.\n\"Did you give it everything you had?\" asked the general dubiously.\n\"I was wide open,\" the professor replied.\nThe television images pulled themselves together, and mingled cries of amazement came over the radios tuned to the observers. The Aleutian sky was streaked with the smoke trails of bombers screaming down in flames. Simultaneously, there appeared high over the rocket target a cluster of white puffs, followed by faint thunder.\nGeneral Barker shook his head happily. \"By George!\" he crowed. \"Well, sir, by George, by George, by George!\"", 0.11247615039281705], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["peter", 0.045662100456621], ["josef", 0.0319634703196347], ["rock",

limestone from the shed. Each box, Peter saw, was marked with a number, and the laborers arranged them in order along a line Borgorov scratched in the dirt with his iron-shod heel.\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Borgorov. \u201cThat\u2019s the lot.\u201d He pointed with a blunt finger. \u201cOne, two, and three. Number one is from the deepest layer\u2014just inside the limestone\u2014and the rest were above it in the order of their numbers.\u201d He dusted his hands and sighed with satisfaction, as though he himself had moved the boxes. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll leave you to work.\u201d He snapped his fingers, and the soldier marched the two Germans down the mountainside. Borgorov followed, hopping twice to get in step.\nFeverishly, Peter and Josef dug into box number one, the one containing the oldest fossils, piling rock fragments on the ground. Each built a white cairn, sat beside it, tailor-fashion, and happily began to sort. The dismal talk of the night before, Peter\u2019s fall from political grace, the damp cold, the breakfast of tepid barley mush and cold tea\u2014all were forgotten. For the moment, their consciousnesses were reduced to the lowest common denominator of scientists everywhere\u2014overwhelming curiosity, blind and deaf to everything but the facts that could satisfy it.\nSome sort of catastrophe had apparently caught the big, pincerless ants in their life routine, leaving them to be locked in rock just as they were until Borgorov\u2019s diggers broke into their tomb millions of years later. Josef and Peter now stared incredulously at evidence that ants had once lived as individuals\u2014individuals with a culture to rival that of the cocky new masters of Earth, men.\n\u201cAny luck?\u201d asked Peter.\n\u201cI\u2019ve found several more of our handsome, big ants,\u201d replied Josef. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be very sociable. They\u2019re always by themselves. The largest group is three. Have you broken any rocks open?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve just been examining the surfaces.\u201d Peter rolled over a rock the size of a good watermelon, and scanned its underside with his magnifying glass. \u201cWell, wait, here\u2019s something, maybe.\u201d He ran his finger over a dome-shaped projection of a hue slightly different than that of the stone. He tapped around it gently with a hammer, painstakingly jarring chips loose. The whole dome emerged at last, bigger than his fist, free and clean\u2014windows, doors, chimney, and all. \u201cJosef,\u201d said Peter. His voice cracked several times before he could finish the sentence. \u201cJosef\u2014they lived in houses.\u201d He stood, with the rock cradled in his arms, an unconscious act of reverence.\nJosef now peered over Peter\u2019s shoulder, breathing down his neck. \u201cA lovely house.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than ours,\u201d said Peter.\n\u201cPeter!\u201d warned Josef.
