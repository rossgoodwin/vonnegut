ashtray overturned and started a fire. He tried to put it out himself with a blanket, causing the flames to spread to the whole top floor of his townhouse. Kurt was rushed to the hospital, suffering from smoke inhalation, and was listed as critical, but he recovered to be released five days later. He had often complained that the Pall Malls he smoked had failed to live up to their promise on the package to kill him, and now\u2014although not in the manner promised\u2014they almost did.\nWhen he was released from the hospital, Kurt repaired to an apartment in Northampton, Massachusetts, where his daughter Nanny and the three Adams brothers were nearby to look after him and drive him on errands. His son, Mark, in Boston and his daughter Edie on Cape Cod came to check up on him, so all six of his children were within comfortable driving distance. During this difficult period, which he compared to \u201cThe Battle of the Bulge,\u201d he enjoyed the support of the kind of extended family he had spent a lifetime extolling.\nKurt signed on to teach at Smith College that fall and had a show of his silk-screen paintings at a local gallery in October. He stayed on to teach in the spring semester and began a new novel about a stand-up comedian, titled If God Were Alive Today, based on the joke that \u201cIf God were alive today he would be an atheist.\u201d He returned to New York just before Memorial Day of 2001.\nThe novel didn\u2019t seduce him into completing it, and he spoke little about it but continued with his drawing and silk screens. The artwork gave Kurt an important creative outlet in the times when he felt like one of Melville\u2019s whalers who \u201chad said absolutely everything they could ever say.\u201d\nAn exhibition of the silk screens of Kurt and his collaborator, Joe Petro III, was held in July of 2004 at the Indianapolis Art Center, along with paintings by Vonnegut\u2019s architect and painter grandfather, his architect and painter father, his painter daughter Edith, and his son, Mark, the doctor\u2013writer\u2013painter. In an author\u2019s note at the end of A Man Without a Country, Vonnegut said that the English artist Ralph Steadman sent him a note of congratulations when he heard about this \u201cfamily show\u201d from Joe Petro III. Kurt wrote in reply that Petro had \u201cstaged a reunion of four generations of my family in Indianapolis, and he has made you and me feel like first cousins.\u201d In that same Author\u2019s Note, Vonnegut wrote that \u201cone of the best things that ever happened to me, a one-in-a-billion opportunity to enjoy myself in perfect innocence, was my meeting Joe \u2026 it seems quite possible in retrospect that Joe Petro III saved my life. I will not explain. I will let it go at that.\u201d\nIt turned out that Vonnegut, unlike Melville\u2019s whalers, had more to say after all\u2014if not in the novel he thought he had been seduced by in 2000 then in op-ed pieces, speeches, political commentaries, and poems. W. H. Auden wrote of William Butler Yeats that \u201cmad Ireland hurt him into poetry.\u201d In the same sense, one could say that the America of the Bush administration during those years\u2014the war in Iraq, the \u201cWall Street crapshoot,\u201d the country\u2019s blithe refusal to deal with the urgent ecological threats\u2014drove Kurt back into writing.\nAt the urging of Joel Bleifuss, the editor of In These Times, a Chicago biweekly, Vonnegut wrote a series of luminous essays that Dan Simon, the publisher of the small Seven Stories Press, had the good sense and foresight to publish as a book. A Man Without a Country became an overnight bestseller. It was Vonnegut\u2019s \u201clast hurrah\u201d and it was not only comprised of scathing commentaries on war, greed, and the destruction of the planet but also hard-earned wisdom, humor, insight, and instruction on writing and on life, which might be summed up in the advice he gave a young fan: \u201cThere\u2019s only one rule that I know of [\u2026] God damn it, you\u2019ve got to be kind.\u201d He first delivered that message in his 1965 novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. It was implicit in all his work, what Henry James called \u201cthe figure in the carpet\u201d\u2014the thread that was woven through the story, including the story of his life.\nThroughout all the public and personal pressures and challenges, Vonnegut produced new work in both writing and art, and continued major speaking engagements in his eighties. He finished writing a speech he was to give in his hometown of Indianapolis (published in Armageddon in Retrospect), where at last he was fittingly honored with what had been officially decreed as \u201cThe Year of Vonnegut.\u201d Only weeks before he was scheduled to give the talk, he fell from the steps of his brownstone in Manhattan and, in the words of his doctor son, Mark, \u201cirreversibly scrambled his precious egg\u201d and died in the hospital on April 11, 2007.\nFrom all indications, there will be many more \u201cyears of Vonnegut,\u201d not only in Indianapolis, where a Vonnegut Museum and Library has been established. Just as his novels of the 1960s had a special appeal for the youth of the time, he was rediscovered by another young generation with the publication in 2005 of A Man Without a Country. He appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart to an appreciative audience and applause. All his books are still in print, and his books are taught in college and high school literature courses throughout the country. My friend Shaun O\u2019Connell, professor of English at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, told me recently he couldn\u2019t get his students interested in Updike or Bellow anymore, \u201cbut they still love reading Vonnegut.\u201d", 0.16964522456709957], "title": "Letters"}}
