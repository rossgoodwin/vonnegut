He, too, believed that they were enemies of the American way of thinking about America. He was offended by how ungrateful to America these fellow Italian immigrants were.\nAccording to Labor\u2019s Untold Story, Capone said, \u201cBolshevism is knocking at our gates\u2026. We must keep the worker away from red literature and red ruses.\u201d\nWhich reminds me of a story written by Dr. Robert Fender, my friend back in prison. The story was about a planet where the worst crime was ingratitude. People were executed all the time for being ungrateful. They were executed the vay people used to be executed in Czechoslovakia. They were defenestrated. They were thrown out of altitudinous windows.\nThe hero in Fender\u2019s story was finally thrown out of a window for ingratitude. His last words, as he went sailing out of a window thirty floors up, were these: \u201cThanks a miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiillionnnnnnnnn!\u201d\nBefore Sacco and Vanzetti could be executed for ingratitude in the Massachusetts style, however, huge crowds turned out in protest all over the world. The fish peddler and the shoemaker had become planetary celebrities.\n\u201cNever in our full life,\u201d said Vanzetti, \u201ccould we hope to do such work for tolerance, for justice, for man\u2019s understanding of man, as now we do by accident.\u201d\nIf this were done as a modern Passion Play, the actors playing the authorities, the Pontius Pilates, would still have to express scorn for the opinions of the mob. But they would be in favor rather than against the death penalty this time.\nAnd they would never wash their hands.\nThey were in fact so proud of what they were about to do that they asked a committee composed of three of the wisest, most respected, most fair-minded and impartial men within the boundaries of the state to say to the world whether or not justice was about to be done.\nIt was only this part of the Sacco and Vanzetti story that Kenneth Whistler chose to tell\u2014that night so long ago, when Mary Kathleen and I held hands while he spoke.", 0.12222222222222223], "title": "Jailbird"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["martians", 0.034722222222222224], ["boca", 0.027777777777777776], ["raton", 0.027777777777777776], ["ships", 0.020833333333333332], ["radio", 0.013888888888888888], ["martian", 0.013888888888888888], ["fight", 0.013888888888888888], ["shot", 0.013888888888888888], ["control", 0.013888888888888888], ["boaz", 0.013888888888888888], ["attacked", 0.013888888888888888], ["landed", 0.013888888888888888], ["pilot", 0.013888888888888888], ["navigators", 0.013888888888888888], ["remnants", 0.006944444444444444], ["scorched", 0.006944444444444444], ["scattered", 0.006944444444444444], ["battle", 0.006944444444444444], ["earth", 0.006944444444444444], ["peterson", 0.006944444444444444], ["mayor", 0.006944444444444444], ["butchering", 0.006944444444444444], ["22", 0.006944444444444444], ["basel", 0.006944444444444444], ["send", 0.006944444444444444], ["survivors", 0.006944444444444444], ["ski", 0.006944444444444444], ["congressional", 0.006944444444444444], ["ross", 0.006944444444444444], ["real", 0.006944444444444444], ["wide", 0.006944444444444444], ["brackman", 0.006944444444444444], ["krishna", 0.006944444444444444], ["meat", 0.006944444444444444], ["success", 0.006944444444444444], ["nicely", 0.006944444444444444], ["dig", 0.006944444444444444], ["companies", 0.006944444444444444], ["gun", 0.006944444444444444], ["switzerland", 0.006944444444444444], ["blew", 0.006944444444444444], ["force", 0.006944444444444444], ["posts", 0.006944444444444444], ["dead", 0.006944444444444444], ["hanged", 0.006944444444444444], ["picked", 0.006944444444444444], ["incidentally", 0.006944444444444444], ["total", 0.006944444444444444], ["space", 0.006944444444444444], ["emerged", 0.006944444444444444], ["listlessly", 0.006944444444444444], ["business", 0.006944444444444444], ["members", 0.006944444444444444], ["squads", 0.006944444444444444], ["care", 0.006944444444444444], ["yard", 0.006944444444444444], ["district", 0.006944444444444444], ["thirty", 0.006944444444444444], ["grievously", 0.006944444444444444], ["florida", 0.006944444444444444], ["amateurs", 0.006944444444444444], ["stand", 0.006944444444444444], ["military", 0.006944444444444444], ["unk", 0.006944444444444444], ["honor", 0.006944444444444444], ["named", 0.006944444444444444], ["point", 0.006944444444444444], ["civilians", 0.006944444444444444], ["seventeen", 0.006944444444444444], ["son", 0.006944444444444444], ["prisoner", 0.006944444444444444], ["armada", 0.006944444444444444], ["garu", 0.006944444444444444], ["electronic", 0.006944444444444444], ["market", 0.006944444444444444], ["millions", 0.006944444444444444], ["troops", 0.006944444444444444], ["lyman", 0.006944444444444444], ["remains", 0.006944444444444444], ["twenty", 0.006944444444444444], ["three", 0.006944444444444444], ["awarded", 0.006944444444444444], ["eleven", 0.006944444444444444], ["fought", 0.006944444444444444], ["sergeant", 0.006944444444444444], ["company", 0.006944444444444444], ["rifle", 0.006944444444444444], ["surrender", 0.006944444444444444], ["professionals", 0.006944444444444444], ["double", 0.006944444444444444], ["nations", 0.006944444444444444], ["mcswann", 0.006944444444444444], ["marines", 0.006944444444444444], ["posthumously", 0.006944444444444444], ["infantry", 0.006944444444444444], ["india", 0.006944444444444444], ["surface", 0.006944444444444444], ["commander", 0.006944444444444444], ["parachute", 0.006944444444444444], ["single", 0.006944444444444444], ["ship", 0.006944444444444444], ["barreled", 0.006944444444444444], ["capture", 0.006944444444444444], ["ideas", 0.006944444444444444], ["instance", 0.006944444444444444], ["lamp", 0.006944444444444444], ["badly", 0.006944444444444444], ["caliber", 0.006944444444444444], ["demanding", 0.006944444444444444], ["assault", 0.006944444444444444], ["arrived", 0.006944444444444444], ["wounded", 0.006944444444444444], ["platoons", 0.006944444444444444], ["flushed", 0.006944444444444444], ["medal", 0.006944444444444444], ["man", 0.006944444444444444], ["shotgun", 0.006944444444444444], ["jail", 0.006944444444444444], ["butchered", 0.006944444444444444], ["american", 0.006944444444444444], ["attacking", 0.006944444444444444], ["left", 0.006944444444444444]], "sentiment": ["Had all these ships landed at one point, the survivors might have made a stand. But the electronic pilot-navigators of the ships had other ideas. The pilot-navigators scattered the remnants of the armada far and wide over the surface of the Earth. Squads, platoons, and companies emerged from the ships everywhere, demanding that nations of millions give in.\nA single, badly scorched man named Krishna Garu attacked all of India with a double-barreled shotgun. Though there was no one to radio-control him, he did not surrender until his gun blew up.\nThe only Martian military success was the capture of a meat market in Basel, Switzerland, by seventeen Parachute Ski Marines.\nEverywhere else the Martians were butchered promptly, before they could even dig in.\nAs much butchering was done by amateurs as by professionals. At the Battle of Boca Raton, in Florida, U.S.A., for instance, Mrs. Lyman R. Peterson shot four members of the Martian Assault Infantry with her son\u2019s .22 caliber rifle. She picked them off as they came out of their space ship, which had landed in her back yard.\nShe was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously.\nThe Martians who attacked Boca Raton, incidentally, were the remains of Unk\u2019s and Boaz\u2019s company. Without Boaz, their real commander, to radio-control them, they fought listlessly, to say the least.\nWhen American troops arrived at Boca Raton to fight the Martians, there was nothing left to fight.

Faith in what? Faith in faith, as nearly as I can tell. That is as detailed as many contemporary preachers care to be, except when amazing audiences of cavemen. How can a preacher tell us about men and women who heard voices without raising questions about schizophrenia, a disease which we know is common in all places and all times.\n\u201cWe know too much for old-time religion; and in a way, that knowledge is killing us.\n\u201cThe Book of Genesis is usually taken to be a story about what happened a long time ago. The beginning of it, at least, can also be read as a prophecy of what is going on right now. It may be that Eden is this planet. If that is so, then we are still in it. It may be that we, poisoned by all our knowledge, are still crawling toward the gate.\n\u201cCan we spit out all our knowledge? I don\u2019t think that is possible. It is something I have often wanted to do. We are stuck with our knowledge, which has seeped into all of our tissues. We had better make the best of a bad situation, which is a wonderful human skill. We had better make use of what has poisoned us, which is knowledge.\n\u201cWhat can we use it for?\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we use it to devise realistic methods for preventing us from crawling out the gate of the Garden of Eden? We\u2019re such wonderful mechanics, maybe we can lock that gate with us inside.\n\u201cIt is springtime here in Paradise. There is hope in the air!\n\u201cIf I talk about the Loud family now, will all of you know who I mean? I don\u2019t mean everybody\u2019s noisy neighbors. I mean a family of prosperous human beings in California, whose last name is Loud. They were the willing subjects last year of a television documentary. Seemingly invisible cameramen and sound men were able to record for all time even the most disappointing and embarrassing moments in their lives.\n\u201cMost viewers, and the Louds themselves, claimed to be mystified by the tinhorn tragedies and unfunny comedies thus immortalized. I suggest to you that the Louds were healthy earthlings who had everything but a religion in which they could believe. There was nothing to tell them what they should want, what they should shun, what they should do next. Socrates told us that the unexamined life wasn\u2019t worth living.

All electric and telephone service had been shut off. When I visited Lyle up there, he knew the story of those holes, knew the sniper had been crucified in the stable loft. He knew that the escaped convicts hadn\u2019t decided yet what to do with him. He knew that he had committed what was in their eyes murder pure and simple. He and Whitey VanArsdale had ambushed and killed 3 escaped convicts who were on their way up the old towpath to the head of the lake, to negotiate with the police and politicians and soldiers at the roadblock there. The would-be negotiators were carrying flags of truce, white pillowcases on broomsticks, when Lyle Hooper and Whitey VanArsdale shot them dead.\nAnd then Whitey was himself shot dead almost immediately, but Lyle was taken prisoner.\nBut what bothered Hooper most when I talked to him up in the bell tower was that his captors called him nothing but \u201cPimp.\u201d\nAT THIS POINT in my story, and in order to simplify the telling, and not to make any political point, let me from now on call the escaped convicts in Scipio what they called themselves, which was \u201cFreedom Fighters.\u201d\nSO LYLE HOOPER was without question responsible for the death of 3 Freedom Fighters carrying flags of truce. The Freedom Fighter who was guarding him in the tower when I came to see him, moreover, was the half brother and former partner in the crack business, along with their grandmother, of 1 of the Freedom Fighters he or Whitey had killed.\nBut all Lyle could talk about was the pain of being called a pimp. To many if not most of the Freedom Fighters, of course, it was no particular insult to call someone a pimp.\nLYLE TOLD ME that he had been raised by his paternal grandmother, who made him promise to leave the world a better place than when he found it. He said, \u201cHave I done that, Gene?\u201d\nI said he had. Since he was facing execution, I certainly wasn\u2019t going to tell him that, in my experience anyway, ambushes made the world seem an even worse place than it was before.\n\u201cI ran a nice, clean place, raised a wonderful son,\u201d he said. \u201cPut out a lot of fires.\u201d\nIT WAS THE Trustees who told the Freedom Fighters that Lyle ran a whorehouse.

So, from the resources of Jones\u2019 household, I was given other clothes. I was given a pair of shiny black trousers by Father Keeley, a silver-colored shirt by Dr. Jones, a shirt that had once been part of the uniform of a defunct American Fascist movement called, straightforwardly enough, \u201cThe Silver Shirts.\u201d And the Black Fuehrer gave me a tiny orange sports coat that made me look like an organ-grinder\u2019s monkey.\nAnd Resi Noth and George Kraft kept me company tenderly\u2014not only nursed me, but did my dreaming and planning for me as well. The big dream was to get out of America as soon as possible. Conversations, in which I took very little part, were a sort of roulette played with the names of warm places purported to be Edens: Acapulco \u2026 Minorca \u2026 Rhodes \u2026 even the Vale of Kashmir, Zanzibar, and the Andaman Islands.\nThe news from the outside world was not such as to make my remaining in America attractive\u2014or even conceivable. Father Keeley went out and bought newspapers several times a day, and, for supplementary enlightenment, we had the blatting of the radio.\nThe Republic of Israel stepped up its demands for me, encouraged by rumors that I wasn\u2019t an American citizen, that I was, in fact, a citizen of nowhere. And the Republic\u2019s demands were framed so as to be educational, too\u2014teaching that a propagandist of my sort was as much a murderer as Heydrich, Eichmann, Himmler, or any of the gruesome rest.\nThat may be so. I had hoped, as a broadcaster, to be merely ludicrous, but this is a hard world to be ludicrous in, with so many human beings so reluctant to laugh, so incapable of thought, so eager to believe and snarl and hate.

Ciardi wrote an angry response to Vonnegut\u2019s satire of a writers\u2019 conference where Ciardi had taught the past summer (the West-Central Writers\u2019 Conference, sponsored by Western Illinois University in Macomb, Illinois). Vonnegut\u2019s piece, called \u201cTeaching the Unteachable,\u201d appeared in The New York Times Magazine and is collected in Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons.\nThe \u201cwar buddy\u201d is Bernard V. O\u2019Hare, who was a P.O.W. with Kurt during the firebombing of Dresden, and became a lifelong friend.\nKitty Sprague is the second wife of Knox Burger.\nDear Knox:\nA while back you urged me to do something with German and Germany and all that, so I have been brushing up on my fifty-word vocabulary, and I am off to Berlin next Tuesday. I\u2019ll have an old war buddy with me. He is now a D.A. in Pennsylvania. We must want the syph pretty bad. Anyway\u2014we\u2019re going to East Berlin and Dresden and Prague and Vienna and Budapest and Warsaw and Leningrad, and it\u2019ll take maybe a month. Playboy is going to pick up part of the tab. I\u2019m going to do a piece on post-war architecture behind the Iron Curtain. Seriously. Jane and Edith are meanwhile going to Madrid to visit Jose Donoso, my Chilean pal. And we will all meet after I am sprung from the Lublinka. Edith, incidentally, went to two life-drawing classes in art school, and was promoted from Freshman to Senior. She draws better than the teachers do.\nMy boy Steve, a junior at Dartmouth, was all set to be a first-string offensive end this year, but then two sophomore super-stars got ahead of him, so he\u2019s mainly on the bench. He ran all summer and lifted weights, but so did they. Part of the trouble, I think, is his having been a super-star as a kid. He topped out last year. In about a year he\u2019ll be boozing and smoking with his Uncle, and getting fat.\nA student of mine has a story in this month\u2019s Atlantic\u2014and there\u2019s a sweet little credit line which tells whose student she was.\nCiardi certainly shit all over me in the Saturday Review. What a nasty old poet he must be. My only response has been to cancel my subscription by telegraph. I don\u2019t subscribe. If I can remember to do it, I will send him roses for the opening festivities at Bread Loaf next summer.\nA guy told me Kitty fell off a bike this summer. She is so beautiful. I hope she is not scarred.\nCheers,", -0.030289001122334444], "title": "Letters"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["tarbell", 0.03571428571428571], ["paint", 0.02857142857142857], ["dr", 0.02142857142857143], ["drum", 0.02142857142857143], ["began", 0.02142857142857143], ["cried", 0.014285714285714285], ["lid", 0.014285714285714285], ["understood", 0.014285714285714285], ["knees", 0.014285714285714285], ["devil", 0.014285714285714285], ["inside", 0.014285714285714285], ["air", 0.014285714285714285], ["pulled", 0.014285714285714285], ["bulging", 0.007142857142857143], ["knotted", 0.007142857142857143], ["quarters", 0.007142857142857143], ["held", 0.007142857142857143], ["quake", 0.007142857142857143], ["amplified", 0.007142857142857143], ["ground", 0.007142857142857143], ["giant", 0.007142857142857143], ["pause", 0.007142857142857143], ["pant", 0.007142857142857143], ["appeared", 0.007142857142857143], ["heroism", 0.007142857142857143], ["leering", 0.007142857142857143], ["breathing", 0.007142857142857143], ["fragment", 0.007142857142857143], ["devised", 0.007142857142857143], ["rise", 0.007142857142857143], ["wave", 0.007142857142857143], ["heaven", 0.007142857142857143], ["installed", 0.007142857142857143], ["nausea", 0.007142857142857143], ["lost", 0.007142857142857143], ["chamber", 0.007142857142857143], ["clothes", 0.007142857142857143], ["stupefied", 0.007142857142857143], ["howled", 0.007142857142857143], ["college", 0.007142857142857143], ["scratching", 0.007142857142857143], ["armageddon", 0.007142857142857143], ["stood", 0.007142857142857143], ["unable", 0.007142857142857143], ["closed", 0.007142857142857143], ["crude", 0.007142857142857143], ["chains", 0.007142857142857143], ["red", 0.007142857142857143], ["shut", 0.007142857142857143], ["barrier", 0.007142857142857143], ["opening", 0.007142857142857143], ["splinter", 0.007142857142857143], ["weak", 0.007142857142857143], ["electrified", 0.007142857142857143], ["water", 0.007142857142857143], ["awing", 0.007142857142857143], ["struggle", 0.007142857142857143], ["trembling", 0.007142857142857143], ["invisible", 0.007142857142857143], ["strangled", 0.007142857142857143], ["sweat", 0.007142857142857143], ["nearby", 0.007142857142857143], ["copper", 0.007142857142857143], ["fantastic", 0.007142857142857143], ["bricks", 0.007142857142857143], ["straining", 0.007142857142857143], ["artists", 0.007142857142857143], ["insulation", 0.007142857142857143], ["reached", 0.007142857142857143], ["schenectady", 0.007142857142857143], ["gurgle", 0.007142857142857143], ["wanted", 0.007142857142857143], ["union", 0.007142857142857143], ["three", 0.007142857142857143], ["breath", 0.007142857142857143], ["recapture", 0.007142857142857143], ["passed", 0.007142857142857143], ["forward", 0.007142857142857143], ["dozens", 0.007142857142857143], ["eyes", 0.007142857142857143], ["muscles", 0.007142857142857143], ["inches", 0.007142857142857143], ["hear", 0.007142857142857143], ["eyed", 0.007142857142857143], ["catch", 0.007142857142857143], ["grunt", 0.007142857142857143], ["effort", 0.007142857142857143], ["wide", 0.007142857142857143], ["locked", 0.007142857142857143], ["hour", 0.007142857142857143], ["soul", 0.007142857142857143], ["will", 0.007142857142857143], ["professor", 0.007142857142857143], ["proof", 0.007142857142857143], ["lock", 0.007142857142857143], ["engineering", 0.007142857142857143], ["dropped", 0.007142857142857143], ["sounding", 0.007142857142857143], ["tumbled", 0.007142857142857143], ["soaked", 0.007142857142857143], ["ideas", 0.007142857142857143], ["food", 0.007142857142857143], ["electrical", 0.007142857142857143], ["forces", 0.007142857142857143], ["inch", 0.007142857142857143], ["picture", 0.007142857142857143], ["hand", 0.007142857142857143], ["moment", 0.007142857142857143], ["lifting", 0.007142857142857143], ["man", 0.007142857142857143], ["telephoned", 0.007142857142857143], ["stupendous", 0.007142857142857143], ["consumed", 0.007142857142857143], ["face", 0.007142857142857143], ["looked", 0.007142857142857143], ["switch", 0.007142857142857143], ["time", 0.007142857142857143], ["toil", 0.007142857142857143], ["understand", 0.007142857142857143]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWell, still got a few more ideas,\u201d said Dr. Tarbell. And then he howled.\nI looked up to see him wide-eyed, leering, trembling all over. He was trying to say something, but all that came out was a strangled gurgle.\nThen began the most fantastic struggle any man will ever see. Dozens of artists have tried to paint the picture, but, bulging as they paint Tarbell\u2019s eyes, red as they paint his face, knotted as they paint his muscles, they can\u2019t recapture a splinter of the heroism of Armageddon.\nTarbell dropped to his knees, and, as though straining against chains held by a giant, he began to inch toward the copper drum. Sweat soaked his clothes, and he could only pant and grunt. Time and again, as he would pause to catch his breath, he was pulled back by invisible forces. And again he would rise to his knees, and toil forward over the lost ground and inches beyond.\nAt last he reached the drum, stood with stupendous effort, as though lifting bricks, and tumbled into the opening. I could hear him scratching against the insulation inside, and his breathing was amplified in the chamber, awing.\nI was stupefied, unable to believe or understand what I\u2019d seen, or to know what to do next.\n\u201cNow!\u201d cried Dr. Tarbell from within the drum. His hand appeared for a moment, pulled the lid shut, and once more he cried, sounding far away and weak, \u201cNow.\u201d\nAnd then I understood, and began to quake, and a wave of nausea passed over me. I understood what it was he wanted me to do, what he was asking with the last fragment of his soul that was being consumed by the Devil in him.\nSo I locked the lid from the outside, and I closed the switch.\nThank heaven Schenectady was nearby.

"sentiment": ["Billy Pilgrim checked into the Royalton Hotel on Forty-fourth Street in New York. He by chance was given a room which had once been the home of George Jean Nathan, the critic and editor. Nathan, according to the Earthling concept of time, had died back in 1958. According to the Tralfamadorian concept, of course, Nathan was still alive somewhere and always would be.\nThe room was small and simple, except that it was on the top floor, and had French doors which opened onto a terrace as large as the room. And beyond the parapet of the terrace was the air space over Forty-fourth Street. Billy now leaned over that parapet, looked down at all the people moving hither and yon. They were jerky little scissors. They were a lot of fun.\nIt was a chilly night, and Billy came indoors after a while, closed the French doors. Closing those doors reminded him of his honeymoon. There had been French doors on the Cape Ann love nest of his honeymoon, still were, always would be.\nBilly turned on his television set, clicking its channel selector around and around. He was looking for programs on which he might be allowed to appear. But it was too early in the evening for programs that allowed people with peculiar opinions to speak out. It was only a little after eight o\u2019clock, so all the shows were about silliness or murder. So it goes.\nBilly left his room, went down the slow elevator, walked over to Times Square, looked into the window of a tawdry bookstore. In the window were hundreds of books about fucking and buggery and murder, and a street guide to New York City, and a model of the Statue of Liberty with a thermometer on it. Also in the window, speckled with soot and fly shit, were four paperback novels by Billy\u2019s friend, Kilgore Trout.\nThe news of the day, meanwhile, was being written in a ribbon of lights on a building to Billy\u2019s back. The window reflected the news. It was about power and sports and anger and death. So it goes.\nBilly went into the bookstore.\nA sign in there said that adults only were allowed in the back. There were peep shows in the back that showed movies of young women and men with no clothes on. It cost a quarter to look into a machine for one minute. There were still photographs of naked young people for sale back there, too. You could take those home. The stills were a lot more Tralfamadorian than the movies, since you could look at them whenever you wanted to, and they wouldn\u2019t change. Twenty years in the future, those girls would still be young, would still be smiling or smoldering or simply looking stupid, with their legs wide open. Some of them were eating lollipops or bananas. They would still be eating those. And the peckers of the young men would still be semierect, and their muscles would be bulging like cannonballs.\nBut Billy Pilgrim wasn\u2019t beguiled by the back of the store. He was thrilled by the Kilgore Trout novels in the front. The titles were all new to him, or he thought they were. Now he opened one. It seemed all right for him to do that. Everybody else in the store was pawing things. The name of the book was The Big Board. He got a few paragraphs into it, and then he realized that he had read it be-fore\u2014years ago, in the veterans\u2019 hospital. It was about an Earthling man and woman who were kidnapped by extra-terrestrials. They were put on display in a zoo on a planet called Zircon-212.\nThese fictitious people in the zoo had a big board supposedly showing stock market quotations and commodity prices along one wall of their habitat, and a news ticker, and a telephone that was supposedly connected to a brokerage on Earth. The creatures on Zircon-212 told their captives that they had invested a million dollars for them back on Earth, and that it was up to the captives to manage it so that they would be fabulously wealthy when they were returned to Earth.", 0.012941919191919192], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["karabekian", 0.053763440860215055], ["yeast", 0.043010752688172046], ["beatrice", 0.03225806451612903], ["truth", 0.03225806451612903], ["believes", 0.021505376344086023], ["alcohol", 0.021505376344086023], ["sugar", 0.021505376344086023], ["piano", 0.021505376344086023], ["yeah", 0.021505376344086023], ["ate", 0.021505376344086023], ["keedsler", 0.021505376344086023], ["bar", 0.021505376344086023], ["limited", 0.010752688172043012], ["crazy", 0.010752688172043012], ["beethoven", 0.010752688172043012], ["softening", 0.010752688172043012], ["people", 0.010752688172043012], ["short", 0.010752688172043012], ["money", 0.010752688172043012], ["purposes", 0.010752688172043012], ["pieces", 0.010752688172043012], ["produced", 0.010752688172043012], ["brain", 0.010752688172043012], ["guessing", 0.010752688172043012], ["close", 0.010752688172043012], ["sweatshirt", 0.010752688172043012], ["hate", 0.010752688172043012], ["find", 0.010752688172043012], ["shit", 0.010752688172043012], ["sat", 0.010752688172043012], ["environment", 0.010752688172043012], ["story", 0.010752688172043012], ["organisms", 0.010752688172043012], ["destroying", 0.010752688172043012], ["hated", 0.010752688172043012], ["surrounded", 0.010752688172043012], ["tiny", 0.010752688172043012], ["lounge", 0.010752688172043012], ["saint", 0.010752688172043012], ["intelligence", 0.010752688172043012], ["tells", 0.010752688172043012], ["champagne", 0.010752688172043012], ["rabo", 0.010752688172043012], ["creature", 0.010752688172043012], ["suffocated", 0.010752688172043012], ["dismay", 0.010752688172043012], ["dialogue", 0.010752688172043012], ["confession", 0.010752688172043012], ["neighbor", 0.010752688172043012], ["cocktail", 0.010752688172043012], ["knew", 0.010752688172043012], ["imprinted", 0.010752688172043012], ["anthony", 0.010752688172043012], ["tempt", 0.010752688172043012], ["likeness", 0.010752688172043012], ["wanted", 0.010752688172043012], ["friends", 0.010752688172043012], ["killed", 0.010752688172043012], ["substance", 0.010752688172043012], ["wore", 0.010752688172043012], ["dreadful", 0.010752688172043012], ["excrement", 0.010752688172043012], ["work", 0.010752688172043012], ["life", 0.010752688172043012], ["amused", 0.010752688172043012], ["excreted", 0.010752688172043012], ["thing", 0.010752688172043012], ["ain", 0.010752688172043012], ["making", 0.010752688172043012], ["kilgore", 0.010752688172043012], ["trout", 0.010752688172043012], ["discussing", 0.010752688172043012], ["called", 0.010752688172043012], ["wrote", 0.010752688172043012]], "sentiment": ["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo was Beatrice Keedsler, but she kept her dismay to herself as she sat at the piano bar with Karabekian. Karabekian, who wore a sweatshirt imprinted with the likeness of Beethoven, knew he was surrounded by people who hated him for getting so much money for so little work. He was amused.\nLike everybody else in the cocktail lounge, he was softening his brain with alcohol. This was a substance produced by a tiny creature called yeast. Yeast organisms ate sugar and excreted alcohol. They killed themselves by destroying their own environment with yeast shit.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nKilgore Trout once wrote a short story which was a dialogue between two pieces of yeast. They were discussing the possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated in their own excrement.

tabulation, with dates, of what I\u2019ve done with my adult life so far, and tells me sternly to leave no periods unaccounted for. I would give a great deal for permission to leave out the last three months, when I served as a tutor in a village called Pisquontuit. Anyone writing my former employer there for an appraisal of my character would get his ears burnt off.\nOn each application form there is a small blank section entitled remarks, where I might tell my side of the Pisquontuit story. But there seems little chance of anyone\u2019s understanding my side if he hasn\u2019t seen Pisquontuit. And the chances of an ordinary man\u2019s seeing Pisquontuit are about the same as his chances for being dealt two spade royal flushes in a row.\nPisquontuit is an Indian word said to mean \u201cshining waters,\u201d and is pronounced Ponit by the few privileged to know that the village exists. It is a secret assemblage of mansions by the sea. The entrance is unmarked, an unpromising lane leading from the main road into a forest of scrub pine. A guard lives in the forest by a turnaround on the lane, and he makes all cars that do not belong in Pisquontuit turn around and go back where they came from. The cars that belong in Pisquontuit are either very big ones or very little ones.\nI worked there as a tutor for Robert Brewer, an amiable, mildly fogbound young man who was preparing to take college entrance examinations and needed help.\nI think I can say without fear of contradiction that Pisquontuit was the most exclusive community in America. While I was there, a gentleman sold his house on the grounds that his neighbors were \u201ca pretty stuffy bunch.\u201d He went back to where he came from, Beacon Hill in Boston. My employer, Robert\u2019s father, Herbert Clewes Brewer, spent most of his time between sailboat races writing indignant letters to Washington. He was indignant because every mansion in the village was shown on United States Geodetic Survey maps, which could be bought by just anybody.\nIt was a quiet community. Its members had paid a handsome price for peace, and small ripples looked like tidal waves. At the heart of my troubles there was nothing more violent or barbaric than the tango.\nThe tango, of course, is a dance of Spanish-American origin, usually in four-four time, and is distinguished by low dips and twisting steps on the toes. One Saturday night, at the weekly dance of the Pisquontuit Yacht Club, young Robert Brewer, my student, who had never even seen the tango performed in his eighteen years of life, began to dip lowly and twist his toes. His movements were tentative at first, as involuntary as shudders. Robert\u2019s mind and face were blank when it happened. The heady Latin music wandered in through his ears, found nobody at home under his crew cut, and took command of his long, thin body.\nSomething clicked, locking Robert in the machinery of the music. His partner, a plain, wholesome girl with three million dollars and a low center of gravity, struggled in embarrassment, and then, seeing the fierce look in Robert\u2019s eyes, succumbed. The two became as one, a fast-moving one.", 0.004799107142857139], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}}
