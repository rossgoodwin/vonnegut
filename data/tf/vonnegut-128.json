I\u2019ve played hell getting it back. [\u2026]\nThe Iowa experience is wearing thin. Two years will be plenty, I think, unless a really whopping offer is made to make me stay.

He has a great big farm with woods and a lake, and his paycheck is big, and he has tenure, and he finds teaching easy as pie. His roots are down.

Bullard, told him the story of his life in the full, round, head tones of a public address system. At their feet lay Bullard\u2019s Labrador retriever, who further tormented the aged listener by probing his ankles with a large, wet nose.\nBullard, who had been, before he retired, successful in many fields, enjoyed reviewing his important past. But he faced the problem that complicates the lives of cannibals\u2014namely: that a single victim cannot be used over and over. Anyone who had passed the time of day with him and his dog refused to share a bench with them again.\nSo Bullard and his dog set out through the park each day in quest of new faces.

Mother and son were so unvain and unafraid. They had such nice times.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut Fred T. Barry must have been temporarily regretful that he\u2019d said that\u2014when we got a good look from the air at the carriage house. We had circled over the city, so we approached the conical roof from the north. Wind had piled snow halfway up the big north window. The drift hid the back door, the kitchen door, entirely. Seeing it from a distance, I imagined that the drift would actually make the place cozier, would shield it from the wind.\nBut we were horrified when we saw the south side. The great doors, which had last been thrown open for Celia Hildreth in 1943, were agape again. The back door had blown open, we would find out later, and the gale it admitted had flung open the great doors from the inside. The enormous open doorway appeared to have tried to vomit the snow which had piled up inside. How deep was the snow inside? Six feet or more.\n21\nFRED T. BARRY and his mother were left off by the helicopter on a rooftop at Barrytron. Mr. Barry maintained the hoax that Felix and I were his employees, and he instructed the pilot sternly that he was to take us wherever we wanted to go, and to stand by until we were through with him. We had all been such great pals, and gone through so much together, and the mood was that we should really see a lot more of each other, and that most people in Midland City weren\u2019t as amusing and worldly as we were, and so on.\nBut I would not see or hear from Mr. Barry for ten more years, and I would never lay eyes on his mother again. Out of sight, out of mind. That\u2019s how it was with the Barrys.\nSo Felix and I used that Air Force helicopter like a taxicab. We went back to the carriage house. There were no footprints there. We had jackets and hats and gloves, but no boots. We were wearing ordinary street shoes, and these filled with snow as we wallowed and tumbled and writhed our way inside. Maybe Mother and Father were under all that snow. If so, they were dead.\nWe got to the staircase, whose bottom half was buried. Knowing our parents, we supposed that they had gone to bed when the blizzard hit. They wouldn\u2019t have got out of bed, we surmised, even after all hell cut loose downstairs. So Felix and I entered their bedroom. The bed was empty. Not only that, but it was stripped of its blankets and sheets. So, maybe Mother and Father had wrapped themselves in bedding, and gone downstairs after all.", 0.18735146966854285], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["resi", 0.03225806451612903], ["forgot", 0.03225806451612903], ["buchanon", 0.03225806451612903], ["cut", 0.03225806451612903], ["war", 0.03225806451612903], ["kicked", 0.03225806451612903], ["eddie", 0.03225806451612903], ["kick", 0.03225806451612903], ["ardennes", 0.016129032258064516], ["brewer", 0.016129032258064516], ["telephone", 0.016129032258064516], ["dead", 0.016129032258064516], ["gun", 0.016129032258064516], ["brought", 0.016129032258064516], ["heard", 0.016129032258064516], ["pole", 0.016129032258064516], ["cold", 0.016129032258064516], ["best", 0.016129032258064516], ["knocked", 0.016129032258064516], ["ansel", 0.016129032258064516], ["doctor", 0.016129032258064516], ["things", 0.016129032258064516], ["nuts", 0.016129032258064516], ["drew", 0.016129032258064516], ["holding", 0.016129032258064516], ["save", 0.016129032258064516], ["beach", 0.016129032258064516], ["friend", 0.016129032258064516], ["told", 0.016129032258064516], ["head", 0.016129032258064516], ["shopping", 0.016129032258064516], ["lot", 0.016129032258064516], ["big", 0.016129032258064516], ["irving", 0.016129032258064516], ["gonna", 0.016129032258064516], ["hand", 0.016129032258064516], ["tiger", 0.016129032258064516], ["aachen", 0.016129032258064516], ["hear", 0.016129032258064516], ["private", 0.016129032258064516], ["foot", 0.016129032258064516], ["trouble", 0.016129032258064516], ["mccarty", 0.016129032258064516], ["killed", 0.016129032258064516], ["germans", 0.016129032258064516], ["man", 0.016129032258064516], ["tank", 0.016129032258064516], ["omaha", 0.016129032258064516], ["ribs", 0.016129032258064516], ["bag", 0.016129032258064516], ["miles", 0.016129032258064516], ["hung", 0.016129032258064516], ["guy", 0.016129032258064516], ["burp", 0.016129032258064516]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat one was for Private Irving Buchanon,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIs that who you are?\u201d I said.\n\u201cBuchanon is dead,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the best friend I ever had.

She had a Xerox of it, and Rumfoord asked her if she had read it.\n\u201cNo.\u201d She didn\u2019t read well, which was one of the reasons she had dropped out of high school.\nRumfoord ordered her to sit down and read the Truman statement now. He didn\u2019t know that she couldn\u2019t read much. He knew very little about her, except that she was one more public demonstration that he was a superman.\nSo Lily sat down and pretended to read the Truman thing, which went like this:\nSixteen hours ago an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese Army base. That bomb had more power than 20,000 tons of T.N.T. It had more than two thousand times the blast power of the British \u201cGrand Slam,\u201d which is the largest bomb ever yet used in the history of warfare.\nThe Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor. They have been repaid many-fold. And the end is not yet. With this bomb we have now added a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the growing power of our armed forces. In their present form these bombs are now in production, and even more powerful forms are in development.\nIt is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe. The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.\nBefore 1939, it was the accepted belief of scientists that it was theoretically possible to release atomic energy. But nobody knew any practical method of doing it. By 1942, however, we knew that the Germans were working feverishly to find a way to add atomic energy to all the other engines of war with which they hoped to enslave the world. But they failed. We may be grateful to Providence that the Germans got the V-1\u2019s and V-2\u2019s late and in limited quantities and even more grateful that they did not get the atomic bomb at all.\nThe battle of the laboratories held fateful risks for us as well as the battles of the air, land, and sea, and we have now won the battle of the laboratories as we have won the other battles.", 0.05733579846079846], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["space", 0.05], ["ships", 0.03333333333333333], ["mars", 0.03333333333333333], ["barked", 0.03333333333333333], ["airlock", 0.03333333333333333], ["dog", 0.03333333333333333], ["night", 0.03333333333333333], ["unk", 0.03333333333333333], ["raised", 0.016666666666666666], ["gong", 0.016666666666666666], ["terrible", 0.016666666666666666], ["feet", 0.016666666666666666], ["file", 0.016666666666666666], ["watched", 0.016666666666666666], ["sailed", 0.016666666666666666], ["drunkenly", 0.016666666666666666], ["open", 0.016666666666666666], ["ground", 0.016666666666666666], ["thought", 0.016666666666666666], ["clung", 0.016666666666666666], ["bunk", 0.016666666666666666], ["watering", 0.016666666666666666], ["long", 0.016666666666666666], ["uniform", 0.016666666666666666], ["melodiously", 0.016666666666666666], ["bronze", 0.016666666666666666], ["lot", 0.016666666666666666], ["struggled", 0.016666666666666666], ["supports", 0.016666666666666666], ["threw", 0.016666666666666666], ["files", 0.016666666666666666], ["eyes", 0.016666666666666666], ["loped", 0.016666666666666666], ["big", 0.016666666666666666], ["time", 0.016666666666666666], ["eternal", 0.016666666666666666], ["seemingly", 0.016666666666666666], ["tiger", 0.016666666666666666], ["formation", 0.016666666666666666], ["arose", 0.016666666666666666], ["studded", 0.016666666666666666], ["great", 0.016666666666666666], ["voice", 0.016666666666666666], ["solid", 0.016666666666666666], ["plain", 0.016666666666666666], ["pipe", 0.016666666666666666], ["ranks", 0.016666666666666666], ["miles", 0.016666666666666666], ["lurched", 0.016666666666666666], ["iron", 0.016666666666666666], ["launched", 0.016666666666666666]], "sentiment": ["He struggled to his feet, clung drunkenly to the pipe supports of the bunk.

Everybody\u2019s intestines, including those of *Kazakh, were still wringing the last of the digestible molecules from what they had eaten the previous afternoon. Nobody was consuming parts of his or her own body yet, the survival scheme of the Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises. The Kanka-bonos certainly knew what hunger was already. For the rest it would be a discovery.\nAnd the only two people who had to keep their strength up, and not just sleep all the time, were Mary Hepburn and the Captain. The Kanka-bono girls understood nothing about the ship or the ocean, and could make no sense of anything that was said to them in any language but Kanka-bono. Hisako was catatonic. Selena was blind, and *Wait was dying. That left only two people to steer the ship and care for *Wait.\nDuring the first night, those two would agree that Mary should steer during the daytime, when the sun would tell her unambiguously which way was east, from which they were fleeing, and which way was west, where the supposed peace and plenty of Baltra lay. And the Captain would navigate by the stars at night.\nWhoever wasn\u2019t steering would have to keep *Wait company, and presumably would catch some sleep while doing so. These were certainly long watches to stand. Then again, this was to be a very brief ordeal, since, according to the Captain\u2019s calculations, Baltra was only about forty hours from Guayaquil.\nIf they had ever reached Baltra, which they never did, they would have found it devastated and depopulated by yet another airmailed package of dagonite.\nHuman beings were so prolific back then that conventional explosions like that had few if any long-term biological consequences. Even at the end of protracted wars, there still seemed to be plenty of people around. Babies were always so plentiful that serious efforts to reduce the population by means of violence were doomed to failure. They no more left permanent injuries, except for the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, than did the Bah\u00eda de Darwin as it slit and roiled the trackless sea.\nIt was humanity\u2019s ability to heal so quickly, by means of babies, which encouraged so many people to think of explosions as show business, as highly theatrical forms of self-expression, and little more.\nWhat humanity was about to lose, though, except for one tiny colony on Santa Rosalia, was what the trackless sea could never lose, so long as it was made of water: the ability to heal itself.\nAs far as humanity was concerned, all wounds were about to become very permanent. And high explosives weren\u2019t going to be a branch of show business anymore.\nYes, and if humanity had continued to heal its self-inflicted wounds by means of copulation, then the tale I have to tell about the Santa Rosalia Colony would be a tragicomedy starring the vain and incompetent Captain Adolf von Kleist. It would have spanned months rather than a million years, since the colonists would never have become colonists.

They, too, become screamingly funny as soon as possible.\nAnd it may be that Mark Twain drew some of his comic energy from a similar uneasiness. He had served the Confederacy briefly, after all, in the bloodiest war in American history, and later faced paying audiences of, among others, Union veterans and their wives.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAn advantage of a writer\u2019s having a joke-making capability is that he or she can be really funny in case something really is funny. Most contemporary American novelists, especially those credited with greatness because their books are so huge, cannot be funny even when it is time to be funny. So they have to pretend to be dealing at all times with matters so serious, good and evil, for example, that there could not possibly be anything funny about them. Thus are their works as consistently lugubrious as bloodhounds appear to be.\nThe books of jokesters are short, which is a social disadvantage in an era when literary importance is measured by the pound. The problem is that jokes deal so efficiently with ideas that there is little more to be said after the punch line has been spoken. It is time to come up with a new idea\u2014and another good joke.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI once asked my friend Joe Heller what he was up to. He said that he had an idea for a new book. I said that one idea wasn\u2019t nearly enough for a whole book. I said this because he is a funny writer.\nIf he had been a serious writer, I would have said one idea was more than enough for a trilogy.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.13732381959126144], "title": "Palm

the chance,\u201d said the minister triumphantly.\nAnnie felt a strange impulse to argue with him and tell him proudly about the letters. But she fought the wicked impulse, and nodded gravely.\nA few would-be lovers called, too, with honorable intentions and a powerful lust for her land. But, while these callers spoke clumsy poetry about her fields, not one made her feel that she was anything more than what she saw of herself in the mirror\u2014a tall, lean woman, as unornamental as a telephone pole, with coarse, work-swollen hands, and a long nose whose tip had been bitten to a permanent red by frost. Like Ed, they never tried.\nThe moment a would-be lover left after a chilly visit, mumbling about weather and crops and twisting his hat, Annie would feel a great need for the letters from Schenectady. She would lock the door, pull the blinds, lie on her bed, and read and reread the letters until hunger or sleep or a knock on the door forced her to hide them again until another time.\nEd died in October, and Annie got along without him and without the letters, too, until the next spring\u2014or what should have been spring. It was in early May, when a sudden, bitter frost killed the daffodil sprouts, that Annie had written:\n\u201cDear 5587: This is the first time I have ever written to a total stranger. I just happened to be waiting in the drugstore to get a prescription for my sinus trouble filled, and I picked up a copy of Western Romance Magazine. I don\u2019t usually read magazines like that. I think they are silly. But I just happened to turn to the pen pals section, and I saw your letter, and I read where you are lonely and could sure use a pen pal.\u201d She smiled at her foolishness. \u201cI will tell you a little about myself,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am fairly young still, and I have brown hair, green eyes, and \u2026\u201d\nIn a week, a reply had come, and the code number used by the magazine became a name: Joseph P. Hawkins, of Schenectady, New York.\n\u201cMy dear Mrs. Cowper:\u201d Hawkins had written, \u201cI have received many replies to my plea for pen pals, but none has moved me more deeply than yours. A meeting of kindred spirits, such as I believe ours to be, is a rare thing, indeed, in this vale of tears, and is fuller of true bliss than the most perfect of physical matings. I see you now as an angel, for the voice I hear in your letters is the voice of an angel. The instant the angel appeared, loneliness fled, and I knew I was not really alone on this vast and crowded planet after all \u2026\u201d\nAnnie had giggled nervously as she read the first letter, and felt guilty about having led the poor man on so, and she had been a little shocked, too, by the ardent tone of the letter. But she\u2019d found herself rereading the letter several times a day, each time with increased pity. At last, in a fever of compassion, she had given the poor man his wish, and painstakingly tried to create another angel for him.\nFrom then on there had been no turning back, no will to turn back.", 0.045580808080808104], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["pills", 0.047058823529411764], ["family", 0.023529411764705882], ["socially", 0.023529411764705882], ["remember", 0.023529411764705882], ["size", 0.011764705882352941], ["apple", 0.011764705882352941], ["people", 0.011764705882352941], ["color", 0.011764705882352941], ["budweiser", 0.011764705882352941], ["explained", 0.011764705882352941], ["matter", 0.011764705882352941], ["unacceptable", 0.011764705882352941], ["dead", 0.011764705882352941], ["hamlet", 0.011764705882352941], ["sample", 0.011764705882352941], ["literature", 0.011764705882352941], ["simply", 0.011764705882352941], ["sufferers", 0.011764705882352941], ["symptoms", 0.011764705882352941], ["spoke", 0.011764705882352941], ["deportamil", 0.011764705882352941], ["help", 0.011764705882352941], ["standing", 0.011764705882352941], ["pharmaceutical", 0.011764705882352941], ["confidence", 0.011764705882352941], ["eli", 0.011764705882352941], ["reference", 0.011764705882352941], ["insulting", 0.011764705882352941], ["doctor", 0.011764705882352941], ["house", 0.011764705882352941], ["began", 0.011764705882352941], ["benzo", 0.011764705882352941], ["cemetery", 0.011764705882352941], ["deportment", 0.011764705882352941], ["felt", 0.011764705882352941], ["good", 0.011764705882352941], ["insides", 0.011764705882352941], ["flooded", 0.011764705882352941], ["state", 0.011764705882352941], ["contentment", 0.011764705882352941], ["treatment", 0.011764705882352941], ["crying", 0.011764705882352941], ["gravely", 0.011764705882352941], ["suffered", 0.011764705882352941], ["lilly", 0.011764705882352941], ["acceptable", 0.011764705882352941], ["obscenities", 0.011764705882352941], ["lentils", 0.011764705882352941], ["shell", 0.011764705882352941], ["dozen", 0.011764705882352941], ["passed", 0.011764705882352941], ["opening", 0.011764705882352941], ["read", 0.011764705882352941], ["company", 0.011764705882352941], ["involuntarily", 0.011764705882352941], ["envelope", 0.011764705882352941], ["trees", 0.011764705882352941], ["gestures", 0.011764705882352941], ["deport", 0.011764705882352941], ["trade", 0.011764705882352941], ["minutes", 0.011764705882352941], ["care", 0.011764705882352941], ["tri", 0.011764705882352941], ["great", 0.011764705882352941], ["thirty", 0.011764705882352941], ["accompanying", 0.011764705882352941], ["fallen", 0.011764705882352941], ["inside", 0.011764705882352941], ["shock", 0.011764705882352941], ["disease", 0.011764705882352941], ["walked", 0.011764705882352941], ["disoriented", 0.011764705882352941], ["tourette", 0.011764705882352941], ["remain", 0.011764705882352941], ["behavior", 0.011764705882352941], ["stopping", 0.011764705882352941], ["addiction", 0.011764705882352941], ["years", 0.011764705882352941], ["wandering", 0.011764705882352941]], "sentiment": ["Budweiser was dead.

spoke at night. On the afternoon before he spoke, I made love to Mary Kathleen O\u2019Looney for the first time. It was mixed up in our young minds, somehow, with the prospect of hearing and perhaps even touching a genuine saint. How better to present ourselves to him or to any holy person, I suppose, than as Adam and Eve\u2014smelling strongly of apple juice?\nMary Kathleen and I made love in the apartment of an associate professor of anthropology named Arthur von Strelitz. His specialty was the headhunters of the Solomon Islands. He spoke their language and respected their taboos. They trusted him. He was unmarried. His bed was unmade. His apartment was on the third floor of a frame house on Brattle Street.\nA footnote to history: Not only that house, but that very apartment would be used later as a set in a very popular motion picture called Love Story. It was released during my early days with the Nixon administration. My wife and I went to see it when it came to Chevy Chase. It was a made-up story about a wealthy Anglo-Saxon student who married a poor Italian student, much against his father\u2019s wishes. She died of cancer. The aristocratic father was played brilliantly by Ray Milland. He was the best thing in the movie. Ruth cried all through the movie. We sat in the back row of the theater for two reasons: so I could smoke and so there wouldn\u2019t be anybody behind her to marvel at how fat she was. But I could not really concentrate on the story, because I knew the apartment where so much of it was happening so well. I kept waiting for Arthur von Strelitz or Mary Kathleen O\u2019Looney or even me to appear.\nSmall world.\nMary Kathleen and I had the place for a weekend. Von Strelitz had given me the key. He had then gone to visit some other German \u00e9migr\u00e9 friends on Cape Ann. He must have been about thirty then. He seemed old to me. He was born into an aristocratic family in Prussia. He was lecturing at Harvard when Hitler became dictator of Germany in the spring of Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-three. He declined to go home. He applied for American citizenship instead. His father, who never communicated with him in any way, would command a corps of S.S. and die of pneumonia during the Siege of Leningrad. I know how his father died, since there was testimony about his father at the War Crimes Trials in Nuremberg, where I was in charge of housekeeping.\nAgain: small world.\nHis father, acting on written orders from Martin Bormann, who was tried in absentia in Nuremberg, caused to be executed all persons, civilian and military, taken prisoner during the siege. The intent was to demoralize the defenders of Leningrad. Leningrad, incidentally, was younger than New York City. Imagine that! Imagine a famous European city, full of imperial treasures and worth besieging, and yet much younger than New York.\nArthur von Strelitz would never learn how his father died. He himself would be rowed ashore from an American submarine in the Solomon Islands as a spy, while they were still occupied by the Japanese.

pulled up to the platform, and President Jonathan Lynn, born Alfred Planck, stood and showed his white teeth and frank gray eyes, squared his broad shoulders, and ran his strong, tanned hands through his curly hair.\nThe television cameras dollied and panned about him like curious, friendly dinosaurs, sniffing and peering. Lynn was boyish, tall, beautiful, and disarming, and, Halyard thought bitterly, he had gone directly from a three-hour television program to the White House.\n\u201cIs this man the spiritual leader of the American people?\u201d asked Khashdrahr.\nHalyard explained the separation of Church and State, and met, as he had expected to meet, with the Shah\u2019s usual disbelief and intimations that he, Halyard, hadn\u2019t understood the question at all.\nThe President, with an endearing, adolescent combination of brashness and shyness, and with the barest trace of a Western drawl, was now reading aloud a speech someone had written about EPICAC XIV. He made it clear that he wasn\u2019t any scientist, but just plain folks, standing here, humble before this great new wonder of the world, and that he was here because American plain folks had chosen him to represent them at occasions like this, and that, looking at this modern miracle, he was overcome with a feeling of deep reverence and humility and gratitude \u2026\nHalyard yawned, and was annoyed to think that Lynn, who had just read \u201corder out of chaos\u201d as \u201corder out of koze,\u201d made three times as much money as he did. Lynn, or, as Halyard preferred to think of him, Planck, hadn\u2019t even finished high school, and Halyard had known smarter Irish setters. Yet, here the son-of-a-bitch was, elected to more than a hundred thousand bucks a year!\n\u201cYou mean to say that this man governs without respect to the people\u2019s spiritual destinies?\u201d whispered Khashdrahr.\n\u201cHe has no religious duties, except very general ones, token ones,\u201d said Halyard, and then he started wondering just what the hell Lynn did do. EPICAC XIV and the National Industrial, Commercial, Communications, Foodstuffs, and Resources Board did all the planning, did all the heavy thinking. And the personnel machines saw to it that all governmental jobs of any consequence were filled by top-notch civil servants. The more Halyard thought about Lynn\u2019s fat pay check, the madder he got, because all the gorgeous dummy had to do was read whatever was handed to him on state occasions: to be suitably awed and reverent, as he said, for all the ordinary, stupid people who\u2019d elected him to office, to run wisdom from somewhere else through that resonant voicebox and between those even, pearly choppers.\nAnd Halyard suddenly realized that, just as religion and government had been split into disparate entities centuries before, now, thanks to the machines, politics and government lived side by side, but touched almost nowhere. He stared at President Jonathan Lynn and imagined with horror what the country must have been like when, as today, any damn fool little American boy might grow up to be President, but when the President had had to actually run the country!", 0.09848139449203279], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["helmholtz", 0.12], ["card", 0.10666666666666667], ["selma", 0.05333333333333334], ["decoding", 0.04], ["file", 0.02666666666666667], ["find", 0.02666666666666667], ["meant", 0.02666666666666667], ["reason", 0.02666666666666667], ["harm", 0.013333333333333334], ["sea", 0.013333333333333334], ["burst", 0.013333333333333334], ["favorite", 0.013333333333333334], ["testing", 0.013333333333333334], ["number", 0.013333333333333334], ["years", 0.013333333333333334], ["drawer", 0.013333333333333334], ["individual", 0.013333333333333334], ["punched", 0.013333333333333334], ["numbers", 0.013333333333333334], ["principal", 0.013333333333333334], ["hunting", 0.013333333333333334], ["twenty", 0.013333333333333334], ["top", 0.013333333333333334], ["placing", 0.013333333333333334], ["tears", 0.013333333333333334], ["startled", 0.013333333333333334], ["copying", 0.013333333333333334], ["big", 0.013333333333333334], ["ground", 0.013333333333333334], ["life", 0.013333333333333334], ["george", 0.013333333333333334], ["read", 0.013333333333333334], ["typed", 0.013333333333333334], ["safe", 0.013333333333333334], ["school", 0.013333333333333334], ["idea", 0.013333333333333334], ["records", 0.013333333333333334], ["completely", 0.013333333333333334], ["geo", 0.013333333333333334], ["ph", 0.013333333333333334], ["thrown", 0.013333333333333334], ["caught", 0.013333333333333334], ["lincoln", 0.013333333333333334], ["locked", 0.013333333333333334], ["wailed", 0.013333333333333334], ["famous", 0.013333333333333334], ["holes", 0.013333333333333334], ["admit", 0.013333333333333334], ["murmured", 0.013333333333333334], ["suppose", 0.013333333333333334], ["order", 0.013333333333333334]], "sentiment": ["It was a famous one, too\u2014a favorite hunting ground for would-be Ph.D.s, since Lincoln\u2019s testing records went back more than twenty-five years.\nIn order to find out what each number meant, Helmholtz would have had to use a decoding card, a card with holes punched in it, which was kept locked up in the principal\u2019s safe.
