Federal Communications Commission, I appreciate this opportunity to testify on the subject before you.\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014or maybe \"heartsick\" is the word\u2014that news has leaked out about it. But now that word is getting around and coming to your official notice, I might as well tell the story straight and pray to God that I can convince you that America doesn\u2019t want what we discovered.\nI won\u2019t deny that all three of us\u2014Lew Harrison, the radio announcer, Dr. Fred Bockman, the physicist, and myself, a sociology professor\u2014found peace of mind. We did. And I won\u2019t say it\u2019s wrong for people to seek peace of mind. But if somebody thinks he wants peace of mind the way we found it, he\u2019d be well advised to seek coronary thrombosis instead.\nLew, Fred, and I found peace of mind by sitting in easy chairs and turning on a gadget the size of a table-model television set. No herbs, no golden rule, no muscle control, no sticking our noses in other people\u2019s troubles to forget our own; no hobbies, Taoism, push-ups or contemplation of a lotus. The gadget is, I think, what a lot of people vaguely foresaw as the crowning achievement of civilization: an electronic something-or-other, cheap, easily mass-produced, that can, at the flick of a switch, provide tranquillity. I see you have one here.\nMy first brush with synthetic peace of mind was six months ago. It was also then that I got to know Lew Harrison, I\u2019m sorry to say. Lew is chief announcer of our town\u2019s only radio station. He makes his living with his loud mouth, and I\u2019d be surprised if it were anyone but he who brought this matter to your attention.\nLew has, along with about thirty other shows, a weekly science program. Every week he gets some professor from Wyandotte College and interviews him about his particular field. Well, six months ago Lew worked up a program around a young dreamer and faculty friend of mine, Dr. Fred Bockman. I gave Fred a lift to the radio station, and he invited me to come on in and watch. For the heck of it, I did.\nFred Bockman is thirty and looks eighteen. Life has left no marks on him, because he hasn\u2019t paid much attention to it. What he pays most of his attention to, and what Lew Harrison wanted to interview him about, is this eight-ton umbrella of his that he listens to the stars with. It\u2019s a big radio antenna rigged up on a telescope mount. The way I understand it, instead of looking at the stars through a telescope, he aims this thing out in space and picks up radio signals coming from different heavenly bodies.\nOf course, there aren\u2019t people running radio stations out there. It\u2019s just that many of the heavenly bodies pour out a lot of energy and some of it can be picked up in the radio-frequency band. One good thing Fred\u2019s rig does is to spot stars hidden from telescopes by big clouds of cosmic dust. Radio signals from them get through the clouds to Fred\u2019s antenna.", 0.09464285714285714], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["josef",

shrugged. \u201cAll right.\u201d He studied the rocks in silence for several minutes. \u201cWell, as you might expect, the pincers are even more pronounced, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd the gatherings are bigger and more crowded, and there are no books, and the posters are as numerous as the ants!\u201d Peter blurted suddenly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d said Josef.\n\u201cAnd the wonderful ants without pincers are gone, aren\u2019t they, Josef?\u201d said Peter huskily.\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d said Josef. \u201cYou\u2019re losing your head over something that happened a thousand thousand years ago\u2014or more.\u201d He tugged thoughtfully at his earlobe. \u201cAs a matter of fact, the pincerless ants do seem extinct.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cAs far as I know, it\u2019s without precedent in paleontology. Perhaps those without pincers were susceptible to some sort of disease that those with pincers were immune to. At any rate, they certainly disappeared in a hurry. Natural selection at its ruggedest\u2014survival of the fittest.\u201d\n\u201cSurvival of the somethingest,\u201d said Peter balefully.\n\u201cNo! Wait, Peter. We\u2019re both wrong. Here is one of the old type ants. And another and another! It looks like they were beginning to congregate, too. They\u2019re all packed together in one house, like matchsticks in a box.\u201d\nPeter took the rock fragment from him, unwilling to believe what Josef said. The rock had been split by Borgorov\u2019s diggers so as to give a clean cross section through the ant-packed house. He chipped away at the rock enclosing the other side of the house. The rock shell fell away. \u201cOh,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI see.\u201d His chippings had revealed the doorway of the little building, and guarding it were seven ants with pincers like scythes. \u201cA camp,\u201d he said, \u201ca reeducation camp.\u201d\nJosef blanched at the word, as any good Russian might, but regained his composure after several hard swallows. \u201cWhat is that starlike object over there?\u201d he said, steering away from the unpleasant subject.\nPeter chiseled the chip in which the object was embedded free from the rest of the rock, and held it out for Josef to contemplate. It was a sort of rosette. In the center was a pincer-less ant, and the petals looked like warriors and workers with their weapons buried and locked in the flesh of the lone survivor of the ancient race. \u201cThere\u2019s your quick evolution, Josef.\u201d He watched his brother\u2019s face intently, yearning for a sign that his brother was sharing his hectic thoughts, his sudden insight into their own lives.", 0.11873973727422006], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["leghorn", 0.0784313725490196], ["favor", 0.058823529411764705], ["jekyll", 0.058823529411764705], ["wrap", 0.0392156862745098], ["chicken", 0.0392156862745098], ["reynolds", 0.0392156862745098], ["orphanage", 0.0392156862745098], ["aye", 0.0392156862745098], ["quietly", 0.0196078431372549], ["amounted", 0.0196078431372549], ["modern", 0.0196078431372549], ["unselfish", 0.0196078431372549], ["depends", 0.0196078431372549], ["college", 0.0196078431372549], ["roasted", 0.0196078431372549], ["enters", 0.0196078431372549], ["cast", 0.0196078431372549], ["remains", 0.0196078431372549], ["disposal", 0.0196078431372549], ["bust", 0.0196078431372549], ["hill", 0.0196078431372549], ["crying", 0.0196078431372549], ["wrapped", 0.0196078431372549], ["life", 0.0196078431372549], ["business", 0.0196078431372549], ["song", 0.0196078431372549], ["wrapping", 0.0196078431372549], ["gawk", 0.0196078431372549], ["roasting", 0.0196078431372549], ["decide", 0.0196078431372549], ["precious", 0.0196078431372549], ["remainder", 0.0196078431372549], ["sentimentality", 0.0196078431372549], ["thought", 0.0196078431372549], ["sang", 0.0196078431372549], ["reputation", 0.0196078431372549], ["beans", 0.0196078431372549], ["liable", 0.0196078431372549], ["asked", 0.0196078431372549]], "sentiment": ["[The remainder of the cast enters quietly to gawk.]\nMRS.
