It imagined the world as the baby Jesus saw it after his birth.\nDear Don\u2014\n[\u2026] Since the publication of Wampeters, Foma and Granfalloons, I have been sending a copy of every speech and article to Sam, on the theory that he would be publishing another non-fiction collection by and by. I have only a dim idea of how much stuff has accumulated in his files by now, and what its quality might be.\nBut I suspect that there is enough good stuff to make another collection, which I would like to call Palm Sunday. I have already roughed out a cover, which would feature a psychedelic cross.\nWould you please have Ross or somebody at Dell look over what Sam has accumulated. Ask Dell to decide whether the pieces would make a book they would like to publish. [\u2026]\nIt might be, in view of the impending economic collapse of the nation, that this might be brought out as a quality paperback, a Delta Book, without the possibly heavy losses in hardcover. As a quality paperback, it could be brought out in the fall without competing with the cheap paperback edition of Jailbird. Also, it might draw some energy from the nearly simultaneous release of the quasi-religious Sun, Moon, Star by Harper and Row.\nCheers\u2014", 0.14876033057851237], "title": "Letters"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["chinese", 0.05], ["laugh", 0.05], ["long", 0.05], ["sew", 0.025], ["studied", 0.025], ["smiled", 0.025], ["hard", 0.025], ["rest", 0.025], ["books", 0.025], ["funny", 0.025], ["light", 0.025], ["ways", 0.025], ["things", 0.025], ["write", 0.025], ["ideal", 0.025], ["book", 0.025], ["lot", 0.025], ["hopefully", 0.025], ["conditions", 0.025], ["hope", 0.025], ["lowie", 0.025], ["good", 0.025], ["frank", 0.025], ["memory", 0.025], ["specialty", 0.025], ["alive", 0.025], ["mom", 0.025], ["hands", 0.025], ["proverb", 0.025], ["newt", 0.025], ["science", 0.025], ["cooks", 0.025], ["paints", 0.025], ["work", 0.025], ["person", 0.025], ["smart", 0.025], ["pictures", 0.025]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYou\u2019ll be one of a long, long line.\u201d She smiled hopefully. \u201cIs it a funny book?\u201d\n\u201cI hope so, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cI like a good laugh.\u201d\n\u201cI know you do.\u201d\n\u201cEach person here has some specialty, something to give the rest.

When we get into bodies for the Pioneers\u2019 Day Parade, we take up over fifty thousand square feet, have to gobble more than three tons of food to get enough energy to march; and lots of us catch colds or worse, and get sore because somebody\u2019s body accidentally steps on the heel of somebody else\u2019s body, and get jealous because some bodies get to lead and others have to stay in ranks, and\u2014oh, hell, I don\u2019t know what all.\nI\u2019m not crazy about the parade. With all of us there, close together in bodies\u2014well, it brings out the worst in us, no matter how good our psyches are. Last year, for instance, Pioneers\u2019 Day was a scorcher. People couldn\u2019t help being out of sorts, stuck in sweltering, thirsty bodies for hours.\nWell, one thing led to another, and the Parade Marshal offered to beat the daylights out of my body with his body, if my body got out of step again. Naturally, being Parade Marshal, he had the best body that year, except for Konigswasser\u2019s cowboy, but I told him to soak his fat head, anyway. He swung, and I ditched my body right there, and didn\u2019t even stick around long enough to find out if he connected. He had to haul my body back to the storage center himself.\nI stopped being mad at him the minute I got out of the body. I understood, you see. Nobody but a saint could be really sympathetic or intelligent for more than a few minutes at a time in a body\u2014or happy, either, except in short spurts. I haven\u2019t met an amphibian yet who wasn\u2019t easy to get along with, and cheerful and interesting\u2014as long as he was outside a body. And I haven\u2019t met one yet who didn\u2019t turn a little sour when he got into one.\nThe minute you get in, chemistry takes over\u2014glands making you excitable or ready to fight or hungry or mad or affectionate, or\u2014well, you never know what\u2019s going to happen next.\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t get sore at the enemy, the people who are against the amphibians. They never get out of their bodies and won\u2019t try to learn. They don\u2019t want anybody else to do it, either, and they\u2019d like to make the amphibians get back into bodies and stay in them.\nAfter the tussle I had with the Parade Marshal, Madge got wind of it and left her body right in the middle of the Ladies\u2019 Auxiliary. And the two of us, feeling full of devilment after getting shed of the bodies and the parade, went over to have a look at the enemy.\nI\u2019m never keen on going over to look at them. Madge likes to see what the women are wearing. Stuck with their bodies all the time, the enemy women change their clothes and hair and cosmetic styles a lot oftener than we do on the women\u2019s bodies in the storage centers.\nI don\u2019t get much of a kick out of the fashions, and almost everything else you see and hear in enemy territory would bore a plaster statue into moving away.\nUsually, the enemy is talking about old-style reproduction, which is the clumsiest, most comical, most inconvenient thing anyone could imagine, compared with what the amphibians have in that line. If they aren\u2019t talking about that, then they\u2019re talking about food, the gobs of chemicals they have to stuff into their bodies. Or they\u2019ll talk about fear, which we used to call politics\u2014job politics, social politics, government politics.", 0.06563740079365081], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["harold", 0.10714285714285714], ["mind", 0.07142857142857142], ["woodly", 0.07142857142857142], ["wouldn", 0.03571428571428571], ["alive", 0.03571428571428571], ["clown", 0.03571428571428571], ["cleverly", 0.03571428571428571], ["creatures", 0.03571428571428571], ["congratulate", 0.03571428571428571], ["elevator", 0.03571428571428571], ["forehead", 0.03571428571428571], ["seriously", 0.03571428571428571], ["answer", 0.03571428571428571], ["fairly", 0.03571428571428571], ["good", 0.03571428571428571], ["touching", 0.03571428571428571], ["experimentally", 0.03571428571428571], ["eat", 0.03571428571428571], ["shoot", 0.03571428571428571], ["happening", 0.03571428571428571], ["ryan", 0.03571428571428571], ["blankly", 0.03571428571428571], ["protected", 0.03571428571428571], ["dream", 0.03571428571428571]], "sentiment": ["WOODLY\nYou have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.
