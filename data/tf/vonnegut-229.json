He stepped onto the emerald clear waters of the Winston Sea, crossed the waters to Winston Niles Rumfoord\u2019s Taj Mahal.\nHe entered the walled yard of the palace, let the air out of his feet.

He didn\u2019t use the name in order to tease Rumfoord. He used it in order to assert the friendship he felt for Rumfoord \u2014 to test the friendship a little, and to watch it endure the test handsomely.\nThere was a reason for Salo\u2019s putting friendship to such a sophomoric test. He had never seen, never even heard of friendship before he hit the Solar System. It was a fascinating novelty to him. He had to play with it.\n\"Skip?\" Salo called again.\nThere was an unusual tang in the air. Salo identified it tentatively as ozone.

It was unusual for Rumfoord not to be snoozing in his chair, for Kazak not to be snoozing beside it. Man and dog spent most of their time by the pool, monitoring signals from their other selves through space and time. Rumfoord was usually motionless in his chair, the fingers of one languid, dangling hand buried in Kazak\u2019s coat.

There\u2019s something about war that brings out greatness. I hate to say that, but it\u2019s true. Of course, maybe that\u2019s because you can get great so quick in a war. Just one damn fool thing for a couple of seconds, and you\u2019re great. I could be the greatest barber in the world, and maybe I am, but I\u2019d have to prove it with a lifetime of great haircutting, and then nobody\u2019d notice. That\u2019s just the way peacetime things are, you know?\n\u201cBut Elm Wheeler, you couldn\u2019t help but notice him when he went hog-wild after he got a letter from his wife saying she\u2019d had a baby, and he hadn\u2019t seen her for two years. Why, he read that and ran up to a machine-gun nest and shot and hand-grenaded everybody in it something awful, then he ran up to another one and mashed up all the people there with his rifle butt, and then, after he\u2019d busted that, he started after a mortar emplacement with a rock in each hand, and they got him with a shell fragment. You could of paid a surgeon a thousand dollars, and he couldn\u2019t of done a nicer job. Well, Elm Wheeler got the Congressional Medal for that, and they laid it in his coffin with him. Just laid it there. Couldn\u2019t hang it around his neck, and if they\u2019d put it on his chest, I expect they\u2019d of had to use solder, he was so full of lead and scrap iron.\n\u201cBut he was great, and nobody\u2019d argue about that, but do you think he could of been great today, in this modern day and age? Wheeler? Elm Wheeler? You know what he would be today? A Reek and Wreck, that\u2019s all. The war made him, and this life would of killed him.\n\u201cAnd another nice thing about war\u2014not that anything about war is nice, I guess\u2014is that while it\u2019s going on and you\u2019re in it, you never worry about doing the right thing. See? Up there, fighting and all, you couldn\u2019t be righter. You could of been a heller at home and made a lot of people unhappy and all, and been a dumb, mean bastard, but you\u2019re king over there\u2014king to everybody, and especially to yourself. This above all, be true to yourself, and you can\u2019t be false to anybody else, and that\u2019s it\u2014in a hole, being shot at and shooting back.\n\u201cThese kids in the Army now, that\u2019s just a place to keep \u2019em off the streets and out of trouble, because there isn\u2019t anything else to do with them. And the only chance they\u2019ll ever get to be anybody is if there\u2019s a war. That\u2019s the only chance in the world they got of showing anybody they lived and died, and for something, by God.\n\u201cUsed to be there was a lot of damn fool things a dumb bastard could do to be great, but the machines fixed that. You know, used to be you could go to sea on a big clipper ship or a fishing ship and be a big hero in a storm. Or maybe you could be a pioneer and go out west and lead the people and make trails and chase away Indians and all that. Or you could be a cowboy, or all kinds of dangerous things, and still be a dumb bastard.\n\u201cNow the machines take all the dangerous jobs, and the dumb bastards just get tucked away in big bunches of prefabs that look like the end of a game of Monopoly, or in barracks, and there\u2019s nothing for them to do but set there and kind of hope for a big fire where maybe they can run into a burning building in front of everybody and run out with a baby in their arms. Or maybe hope\u2014though they don\u2019t say so out loud because the last one was so terrible\u2014for another war. Course, there isn\u2019t going to be another one.\n\u201cAnd, oh, I guess machines have made things a lot better. I\u2019d be a fool to say they haven\u2019t, though there\u2019s plenty who say they haven\u2019t, and I can see what they mean, all right. It does seem like the machines took all the good jobs, where a man could be true to hisself and false to nobody else, and left all the silly ones. And I guess I\u2019m just about the end of a race, standing here on my own two feet.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m lucky barbering held out as long as it did\u2014long enough to take care of me. And I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have any kids. That way it comes out even, and I don\u2019t have to think about this shop not being here for them, about nothing being for them but the Army or the Reeks and Wrecks, probably\u2014unless an engineer or manager or research man or bureaucrat got at my wife, and the kids had their brains instead of mine. But Clara\u2019d let one of those jerks at her just about as quick as you could stuff a pound of oleomargarine up a cat\u2019s ass with a hot awl.\n\u201cAnyway, I hope they keep those barber machines out of Miami Beach for another two years, and then I\u2019ll be ready to retire and the hell with them. They had the man who invented the damn things on television the other night, and turns out he\u2019s a barber hisself. Said he kept worrying and worrying about somebody was going to invent a haircutting machine that\u2019d put him out of business. And he\u2019d have nightmares about it, and when he\u2019d wake up from them, he\u2019d tell hisself all the reasons why they couldn\u2019t ever make a machine that\u2019d do the job\u2014you know, all the complicated motions a barber goes through. And then, in his next nightmare, he\u2019d dream of a machine that did one of the jobs, like combing, and he\u2019d see how it worked clear as a bell. And it was just a vicious circle. He\u2019d dream. Then he\u2019d tell hisself something the machine couldn\u2019t do. Then he\u2019d dream of a machine, and he\u2019d see just how a machine could do what he\u2019d said it couldn\u2019t do. And on and on, until he\u2019d dreamed up a whole machine that cut hair like nobody\u2019s business. And he sold his plans for a hundred thousand bucks and royalties, and I don\u2019t guess he has to worry about anything any more.", 0.06244747899159663], "title": "Player Piano"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["people", 0.03333333333333333], ["coffee", 0.03333333333333333], ["door", 0.03333333333333333], ["town", 0.03333333333333333], ["feet", 0.022222222222222223], ["hilton", 0.022222222222222223], ["enclosure", 0.022222222222222223], ["lawrence", 0.022222222222222223], ["tub", 0.022222222222222223], ["wanted", 0.022222222222222223], ["eyes", 0.022222222222222223], ["flamingo", 0.022222222222222223], ["seahorse", 0.022222222222222223], ["truck", 0.022222222222222223], ["harry", 0.022222222222222223], ["crocker", 0.022222222222222223], ["head", 0.022222222222222223], ["gloria", 0.022222222222222223], ["measuring", 0.011111111111111112], ["crazy", 0.011111111111111112], ["set", 0.011111111111111112], ["absolutely", 0.011111111111111112], ["house", 0.011111111111111112], ["accurate", 0.011111111111111112], ["plant", 0.011111111111111112], ["middle", 0.011111111111111112], ["finish", 0.011111111111111112], ["maid", 0.011111111111111112], ["barefoot", 0.011111111111111112], ["drove", 0.011111111111111112], ["open", 0.011111111111111112], ["size", 0.011111111111111112], ["liable", 0.011111111111111112], ["insisted", 0.011111111111111112], ["stood", 0.011111111111111112], ["missed", 0.011111111111111112], ["cup", 0.011111111111111112], ["pay", 0.011111111111111112], ["extra", 0.011111111111111112], ["murra", 0.011111111111111112], ["attracted", 0.011111111111111112], ["going", 0.011111111111111112], ["lot", 0.011111111111111112], ["figures", 0.011111111111111112], ["hope", 0.011111111111111112], ["real", 0.011111111111111112], ["exactly", 0.011111111111111112], ["inches", 0.011111111111111112], ["big", 0.011111111111111112], ["attention", 0.011111111111111112], ["telephone", 0.011111111111111112], ["busy", 0.011111111111111112], ["massachusetts", 0.011111111111111112], ["high", 0.011111111111111112], ["plumber", 0.011111111111111112], ["hour", 0.011111111111111112], ["called", 0.011111111111111112], ["wooden", 0.011111111111111112], ["sandblast", 0.011111111111111112], ["dollars", 0.011111111111111112], ["bottom", 0.011111111111111112], ["life", 0.011111111111111112], ["order", 0.011111111111111112], ["miles", 0.011111111111111112], ["husband", 0.011111111111111112], ["bathtub", 0.011111111111111112], ["rack", 0.011111111111111112], ["luck", 0.011111111111111112]], "sentiment": ["So I went out to my truck, and I drove into town, had a cup of coffee. The door for the bathtub enclosure was on a wooden rack on the back of my truck, out in the open\u2014and it certainly attracted a lot of attention.\nMost people, when they order an enclosure door, don\u2019t want anything on it unless maybe a flamingo or a seahorse. The plant, which is over in Lawrence, Massachusetts, is set up to sandblast a flamingo or a seahorse on a door for only six dollars extra. But Gloria Hilton wanted a big \"G,\" two feet across\u2014 and in the middle of the \"G\" she wanted a life-size head of herself. And the eyes on the head had to be exactly five feet two inches above the bottom of the tub, because that\u2019s how high her real eyes were when she stood up barefoot in the tub.\nThey went crazy over in Lawrence.\nOne of the people I was having coffee with was Harry Crocker, the plumber. \"I certainly hope you insisted on measuring her yourself,\" he said, \"so the figures would be absolutely accurate.\"\n\"Her husband did it,\" I said.\n\"Some people have all the luck,\" he said.\nI went to the pay telephone, and I called up Murra\u2019s house to see if it would be all right for me to come back and finish up. The line was busy.\nWhen I got back to my coffee, Harry Crocker said to me, \"You missed something I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s ever liable to see in this town ever again.\"\n\"What\u2019s that?\" I said.\n\"Gloria Hilton and her maid going through town at two hundred miles an hour,\" he said.", 0.08121428571428572], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["anne", 0.03937007874015748], ["henry", 0.03937007874015748], ["park", 0.031496062992125984], ["oranges", 0.023622047244094488], ["fun", 0.023622047244094488], ["hand", 0.023622047244094488], ["gates", 0.015748031496062992], ["transformed", 0.015748031496062992], ["wouldn", 0.015748031496062992], ["steal", 0.015748031496062992], ["wintertime", 0.015748031496062992], ["hobo", 0.015748031496062992], ["slope", 0.007874015748031496], ["hooks", 0.007874015748031496], ["cheap", 0.007874015748031496], ["held", 0.007874015748031496], ["sleep", 0.007874015748031496], ["touch", 0.007874015748031496], ["fuddled", 0.007874015748031496], ["letting", 0.007874015748031496], ["bosom", 0.007874015748031496], ["bench", 0.007874015748031496], ["thieves", 0.007874015748031496], ["money", 0.007874015748031496], ["worth", 0.007874015748031496], ["string", 0.007874015748031496], ["dark", 0.007874015748031496], ["kiss", 0.007874015748031496], ["hands", 0.007874015748031496], ["exact", 0.007874015748031496], ["heaven", 0.007874015748031496], ["thrill", 0.007874015748031496], ["marry", 0.007874015748031496], ["fishline", 0.007874015748031496], ["garage", 0.007874015748031496], ["miles", 0.007874015748031496], ["sinker", 0.007874015748031496], ["foolish", 0.007874015748031496], ["black", 0.007874015748031496], ["gargoyle", 0.007874015748031496], ["regret", 0.007874015748031496], ["ten", 0.007874015748031496], ["people", 0.007874015748031496], ["fish", 0.007874015748031496], ["hard", 0.007874015748031496], ["understood", 0.007874015748031496], ["manly", 0.007874015748031496], ["lights", 0.007874015748031496], ["fountain", 0.007874015748031496], ["paradise", 0.007874015748031496], ["surprise", 0.007874015748031496], ["movement", 0.007874015748031496], ["knowing", 0.007874015748031496], ["beacon", 0.007874015748031496], ["beaches", 0.007874015748031496], ["hiding", 0.007874015748031496], ["boy", 0.007874015748031496], ["stone", 0.007874015748031496], ["river", 0.007874015748031496], ["florida", 0.007874015748031496], ["loudly", 0.007874015748031496], ["orchids", 0.007874015748031496], ["puzzle", 0.007874015748031496], ["wastebasket", 0.007874015748031496], ["glance", 0.007874015748031496], ["ungainly", 0.007874015748031496], ["live", 0.007874015748031496], ["stepladder", 0.007874015748031496], ["homemade", 0.007874015748031496], ["comradely", 0.007874015748031496], ["white", 0.007874015748031496], ["meeting", 0.007874015748031496], ["lunatics", 0.007874015748031496], ["store", 0.007874015748031496], ["glanced", 0.007874015748031496], ["shouldered", 0.007874015748031496], ["word", 0.007874015748031496], ["detached", 0.007874015748031496], ["crazy", 0.007874015748031496], ["styx", 0.007874015748031496], ["cents", 0.007874015748031496], ["mind", 0.007874015748031496], ["sleeping", 0.007874015748031496], ["hardware", 0.007874015748031496], ["middle", 0.007874015748031496], ["rim", 0.007874015748031496], ["throat", 0.007874015748031496], ["swung", 0.007874015748031496], ["worry", 0.007874015748031496], ["grown", 0.007874015748031496], ["harshnesses", 0.007874015748031496], ["cannonballs", 0.007874015748031496], ["shirt", 0.007874015748031496], ["palms", 0.007874015748031496], ["moment", 0.007874015748031496], ["revealed", 0.007874015748031496], ["grow", 0.007874015748031496], ["man", 0.007874015748031496], ["honestly", 0.007874015748031496], ["mother", 0.007874015748031496], ["necklace", 0.007874015748031496], ["weigh", 0.007874015748031496], ["butterball", 0.007874015748031496], ["tanned", 0.007874015748031496]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind sleeping on a park bench,\u201d said Anne loudly. \u201cI think it would be fun.

The person loses whatever it is, and then gets it back forever. As a graph, it looks like this:\nAn American Indian creation myth, in which a god of some sort gives the people the sun and then the moon and then the bow and arrow and then the corn and so on, is essentially a staircase, a tale of accumulation:\nAlmost all creation myths are staircases like that. Our own creation myth, taken from the Old Testament, is unique, so far as I could discover, in looking like this:\nThe sudden drop in fortune, of course, is the ejection of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden.\nFranz Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Metamorphosis,\u201d in which an already hopelessly unhappy man turns into a cockroach, looks like this:\nBut could my graphs, when all was said and done, be useful as anything more than little visual comedies, cartoons of a sort? The University of Chicago asked me that, and I had to ask myself that, and I say again what I said at the beginning: that the graphs were at least as suggestive as pots or spearheads.\nBut then I had another look at a graph I had drawn of Western civilization\u2019s most enthusiastically received story, which is \u201cCinderella.\u201d At this very moment, a thousand writers must be telling that story again in one form or another. This very book is a Cinderella story of a kind.\nI confessed that I was daunted by the graph of \u201cCinderella,\u201d and was tempted to leave it out of my thesis, since it seemed to prove that I was full of shit. It seemed too complicated and arbitrary to be a representative artifact\u2014 lacked the simple grace of a pot or a spearhead. Have a look:\nThe steps, you see, are all the presents the fairy godmother gave to Cinderella, the ball gown, the slippers, the carriage, and so on. The sudden drop is the stroke of midnight at the ball. Cinderella is in rags again. All the presents have been repossessed. But then the prince finds her and marries her, and she is infinitely happy ever after. She gets all the stuff back, and then some.

I have no secretary. I had one for a little while last year, but we finally parted out of embarrassment. Neither one of us could figure out what we were supposed to be doing.\nAnyway\u2014I was warmed by all the affectionate nostalgia in your note in July, and here I am warmed again, a week before taking off for a few days of riotous living in the fleshpots of Moscow. I\u2019m going over there to see my seventy-six-year-old translator, a magnificent woman who took a doctor\u2019s degree in physiology under Pavlov. She has been allowed out of the worker\u2019s paradise only four times in her entire life. We got to know her during one of those times\u2014in Paris. Now she will probably never be allowed out again. She has made friends with too many of the wrong people. I raised money to bring her here for a visit.
