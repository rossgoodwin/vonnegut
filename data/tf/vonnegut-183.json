I bought a duplex with a low-interest company loan. I cashed stock options for clothes and furniture. I became a fixture at the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Ballet, coming and going by limousine.\nI gave intimate parties at my home for RAMJAC authors and recording artists and movie actors and circus performers\u2014Isaac Bashevis Singer, Mick Jagger, Jane Fonda, G\u00fcnther Gebel Williams, and the like. It was fun. After RAMJAC acquired the Marlborough Gallery and Associated American Artists, I had painters and sculptors to my parties, too.\nHow well did I do at RAMJAC? During my incumbency, my division, including subsidiaries under its control, both covert and overt, won eleven platinum records, forty-two gold records, twenty-two Oscars, eleven National Book Awards, two American League pennants, two National League pennants, two World Series, and fifty-three Grammies\u2014and we never failed to show a return on capital of less than 23 percent. I even engaged in corporate in-fighting, preventing the transfer of the catfood company from my division to General Foods. It was exciting. I got really mad.\nWe just missed getting another Nobel prize in literature several times. But then we already had two: Saul Bellow and Mr. Singer.\nI myself have made Who\u2019s Who for the first time in my life. This is a slightly tarnished triumph, admittedly, since my own division controls Gulf & Western, which controls Who\u2019s Who. I put it all in there, except for the prison term and the name of my son: where I was born, where I went to college, various jobs I\u2019ve held, my wife\u2019s maiden name.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDid I invite my own son to my parties\u2014to chat with so many heroes and heroines of his? No. Did he quit the Times when I became his superior there? No. Did he write or telephone greetings of any sort? No. Did I try to get in touch with him? Only once. I was in the basement apartment of Leland and Sarah Clewes. I had been drinking, something I don\u2019t enjoy and rarely do. And I was physically so close to my son. His apartment was only thirty feet above my head.\nIt was Sarah who had made me telephone him.\nSo I dialed my son\u2019s number. It was about eight o\u2019clock at night. One of my little grandchildren answered, and I asked him his name.\n\u201cJuan,\u201d he said.", 0.13030465367965366], "title": "Jailbird"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["carried", 0.042105263157894736], ["redwine", 0.031578947368421054], ["shot", 0.021052631578947368], ["handicaps", 0.021052631578947368], ["person", 0.021052631578947368], ["forty", 0.021052631578947368], ["race", 0.021052631578947368], ["wrist", 0.021052631578947368], ["gladly", 0.021052631578947368], ["cheek", 0.021052631578947368], ["life", 0.021052631578947368], ["heavy", 0.010526315789473684], ["raised", 0.010526315789473684], ["engendered", 0.010526315789473684], ["apple", 0.010526315789473684], ["accepted", 0.010526315789473684], ["stronger", 0.010526315789473684], ["wetness", 0.010526315789473684], ["proudly", 0.010526315789473684], ["ankles", 0.010526315789473684], ["hath", 0.010526315789473684], ["weaker", 0.010526315789473684], ["newsboy", 0.010526315789473684], ["bespectacled", 0.010526315789473684], ["faith", 0.010526315789473684], ["slab", 0.010526315789473684], ["standing", 0.010526315789473684], ["strapped", 0.010526315789473684], ["canvas", 0.010526315789473684], ["sote", 0.010526315789473684], ["lens", 0.010526315789473684], ["fair", 0.010526315789473684], ["lead", 0.010526315789473684], ["wore", 0.010526315789473684], ["meekest", 0.010526315789473684], ["member", 0.010526315789473684], ["chest", 0.010526315789473684], ["swich", 0.010526315789473684], ["overhead", 0.010526315789473684], ["wet", 0.010526315789473684], ["whan", 0.010526315789473684], ["perced", 0.010526315789473684], ["droughte", 0.010526315789473684], ["admit", 0.010526315789473684], ["slabs", 0.010526315789473684], ["licour", 0.010526315789473684], ["blue", 0.010526315789473684], ["rafter", 0.010526315789473684], ["bound", 0.010526315789473684], ["bags", 0.010526315789473684], ["flour", 0.010526315789473684], ["pulpit", 0.010526315789473684], ["hand", 0.010526315789473684], ["twinkling", 0.010526315789473684], ["spectacles", 0.010526315789473684], ["fell", 0.010526315789473684], ["shoures", 0.010526315789473684], ["strong", 0.010526315789473684], ["weights", 0.010526315789473684], ["veyne", 0.010526315789473684], ["straps", 0.010526315789473684], ["marche", 0.010526315789473684], ["droplet", 0.010526315789473684], ["kind", 0.010526315789473684], ["rattled", 0.010526315789473684], ["pounds", 0.010526315789473684], ["country", 0.010526315789473684], ["bathed", 0.010526315789473684], ["looked", 0.010526315789473684], ["bag", 0.010526315789473684], ["aprille", 0.010526315789473684], ["vertu", 0.010526315789473684], ["brush", 0.010526315789473684], ["ruddy", 0.010526315789473684], ["iron", 0.010526315789473684], ["time", 0.010526315789473684], ["hung", 0.010526315789473684], ["shoulder", 0.010526315789473684], ["weakest", 0.010526315789473684], ["rote", 0.010526315789473684], ["left", 0.010526315789473684]], "sentiment": ["Whan that Aprille with his shoures sote\nThe droughte of Marche hath perced to the rote\nAnd bathed every veyne in swich licour,\nOf which vertu engendered is the flour\u2014\nA droplet fell twinkling from the rafter overhead, wet the left lens of Redwine\u2019s spectacles and his apple cheek.\nTime had been kind to Redwine.

He had no money for any form of transportation, so he set out on foot. He began the five mile walk down Fairchild Boulevard\u2014toward a tiny amber dot at the other end. The dot was the Midland City Center for the Arts. He would make it grow by walking toward it. When his walking had made it big enough, it would swallow him up. There would be food inside.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI was waiting to intercept him, about six blocks away. I sat in a Plymouth Duster I had rented from Avis with my Diners\u2019 Club card, I had a paper tube in my mouth. It was stuffed with leaves. I set it on fire. It was a soign\u00e9 thing to do.\nMy penis was three inches long and five inches in diameter. Its diameter was a world\u2019s record as far as I knew. It slumbered now in my Jockey Shorts. And I got out of the car to stretch my legs, which was another soign\u00e9 thing to do. I was among factories and warehouses. The streetlights were widely-spaced and feeble. Parking lots were vacant, except for night watchmen\u2019s cars which were here and there. There was no traffic on Fairchild Boulevard, which had once been the aorta of the town. The life had all been drained out of it by the Interstate and by the Robert F. Kennedy Inner Belt Expressway, which was built on the old right-of-way of the Monon Railroad. The Monon was defunct.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDefunct.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNobody slept in that part of town. Nobody lurked there.

"sentiment": ["Larry was something of a Bluebeard, and, may I say, a lucky dog while his luck held out. Edith, Janice, Beatrix, and Ellen\u2014the most recent group of graduates\u2014loved and were loved in turn. And, in turn, given the ax. They were wonderful looking girls, every one of them. There were also more like them where they had come from, and those others were boarding trains and planes and convertibles to come to New York because they wanted to sing. Larry had no replacement problem. And, with plenty of replacements, he was spared the temptation of making some sort of permanent arrangement, such as marriage.\nLarry\u2019s life, like most bachelors\u2019 lives, but far more so, had every minute accounted for, with very little time for women as women. The time he had set aside for whatever student happened to be in favor was Monday and Thursday evenings, to be exact. There was a time for giving lessons, a time for lunch with friends, a time for practice, a time for his barber, a time for two cocktails with me\u2014a time for everything, and he never varied his schedule by more than a few minutes. Similarly, he had his studio exactly as he wanted it\u2014a place for everything, with no places begging, and with no thing, in his eyes, dispensable. While he might have been on the fence about marriage as a young young man, marriage soon became impossible. Where he might once have had a little time and space to fit in a wife\u2014a cramped wife\u2014there came to be none, absolutely none.\n\u201cHabit\u2014it\u2019s my strength!\u201d Larry once said. \u201cAhhhh, wouldn\u2019t they love to catch Larry, eh? And remake him, eh? Well, before they can get me into their traps, they\u2019ve got to blast me out of my rut, and it can\u2019t be done. I love my cozy little rut. Habit\u2014Aes triplex.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d I said.\n\u201cAes triplex\u2014triple armor,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Aes Kleenex would have been closer to the truth, but neither one of us knew that then. Ellen Sparks was around, and ascendant in Larry\u2019s heavens\u2014Beatrix Werner having been liquidated a couple of months before\u2014but Ellen was showing no signs of being any different than the rest.\nI said I liked women, and gave as examples some of Larry\u2019s students, including Ellen. I liked them from a safe distance. After Larry, in his amorous cycle with a favorite, ceased to be a father away from home and eased into a warmer role, I in turn became sort of a father. A lackadaisical, slipshod father, to be sure, but the girls liked to tell me how things were going, and ask my advice. They had a lemon of an adviser in me, because all I could ever think of to say was \u201cOh well, what the hell, you\u2019re only young once.\u201d\nI said as much to Ellen Sparks, an awfully pretty brunette not likely to be depressed by thoughts or want of money. Her speaking voice was pleasant enough, but when she sang it was as though her vocal cords had risen into her sinuses.\n\u201cA Jew\u2019s harp with lyrics,\u201d said Larry, \u201cwith Italian lyrics in a Middle Western accent, yet.\u201d But he kept her on, because Ellen was a lot of fun to look at, and she paid her fees promptly, and never seemed to notice that Larry charged her for a lesson whatever he happened to need at the moment.\nI once asked her where she\u2019d gotten the idea to be a singer, and she said she liked Lily Pons. To her that was an answer, and a perfectly adequate one. Actually, I think she wanted to get away from the home reservation and have some fun being rich where nobody knew her. She probably drew lots to see whether the excuse would be music, drama, or art. At that, she was more serious-minded than some of the girls in her situation. One girl I know about set herself up in a suite with her father\u2019s money, and broadened herself by subscribing to several newsmagazines. One hour out of every day, she religiously underlined everything in them that seemed important.

Or we could keep in touch and come to love each other even more than we have before.\nThe second possibility is the attractive one for me. It\u2019s the absolutely necessary one for me. And the trouble with it is that you will have to write me a lot, or some, anyway, and call up sometimes, and so on. We\u2019ve got to wish each other happy birthdays, and ask how work is going, and tell each other jokes, and all that. And you\u2019ve got to visit me often, and I\u2019ve got to pay more attention to what sorts of things are really good times instead of chores for you.\nJane and I get along very well these days. Our letters to each other are friendly\u2014and the telephone calls, too. We feel friendlier and more open with each other than we have for years: no more fighting while wearing masks. Things would have gotten much worse if we had kept going the way we were going\u2014and life would have looked much uglier to you.\nYour mother and father like each other a lot, something you must have doubted sometimes in the past. And we both want you to go to Austria next semester. The drawback to that trip is that you will be expected to write us a lot of letters. But do it anyway. If I were younger, I think I might try to become a European.
