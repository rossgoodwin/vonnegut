Miller Harris had written for The Cornell Sun during the time that Kurt also wrote for the paper and in WWII served in the infantry in Europe. After the war he began writing short stories and sending them to magazines while working at the Eagle Shirtmakers, founded by his great-grandfather Jacob Miller in 1867. He published a short story in Harper\u2019s magazine in 1948 and a humorous golf story in Collier\u2019s in 1952. Harris told me in 2011 (while on his way to a menswear conference in Las Vegas) that he had \u201ctried to write nights and weekends in the early years. Lonely mission soon aborted. Shirt business consumed my days. All seven of them.\u201d He served as CEO of Eagle Shirtmakers from 1946 until 1985, and at ninety was \u201cstill designing and marketing upscale shirts. Fun. Easy. Keeps me young.\u201d Harris and Kurt remained friends and corresponded intermittently throughout Kurt\u2019s life.\nFred Simon Rosenau was a friend of Jane Cox\u2019s at Swarthmore and served with the Office of War Information in the Far East during WWII. He met Kurt at the University of Chicago and then worked in publishing for Doubleday in New York City.\nDear Miller:\nYours of February 8th gratefully received and pleasantly at hand.\nI have been keeping sort of vague track of you through one Fred Rosenau, a small acquaintance I made at the University of Chicago. He says you run a shirt factory. Then again, he\u2019s paranoid. He thinks he runs Doubleday & Co., Inc.\nThere is also Knox: he says you wrote a very funny story about golf (go ahead and piddle while the world\u2019s stockpiling H-bombs), which he bought. Since my admittedly flashy beginning with \u201cReport on the Barnhouse Effect\u201d, I have been banging out reams of tripe in a lunatic get-rich-quick scheme. It hasn\u2019t panned out. I think Knox figured he had a discovery for a minute there, but now he\u2019s beginning to look to Yaddo again. Shit on him, boy.\nSince my father is a poor but honest architect, I don\u2019t have a shirt factory. I do have a wife and two kids, though. So I work for General Electric, writing publicity for them:\nSCHENECTADY, N.Y., Feb. 16\u2014General Electric engineers have developed a stupefying new electrical device which will make the second coming of Christ a matter of mere academic interest, it was announced here today.\u2026 etc.\nCynical, cynical little hack,\nI will knife you in the back.", -0.011966891133557797], "title":

Couldn\u2019t she be sad about something, and still look that way? Is she married, do you think? Does she have a kid? Is she nice to it? Where do you think she\u2019s going next? Does she want to go?\nIf there was a bowl of fruit in the painting, a grownup might ask, \u201cDon\u2019t those nim-nims look good enough to eat? Yummy yum yum!\u201d\nThese examples of Boobooling pedagogy aren\u2019t mine. They\u2019re Kilgore Trout\u2019s.\nThus were the brains of most, but not quite all, Booboolings made to grow circuits, microchips, if you like, which on Earth would be called imaginations. Yes, and it was precisely because a vast majority of Booboolings had imaginations that two of the B-36 sisters, the short story writer and the painter, were so beloved.\nThe bad sister had an imagination, all right, but not in the field of art appreciation. She wouldn\u2019t read books or go to art galleries. She spent every spare minute when she was little in the garden of a lunatic asylum next door. The psychos in the garden were believed to be harmless, so her keeping them company was regarded as a laudably compassionate activity. But the nuts taught her thermodynamics and calculus and so on.\nWhen the bad sister was a young woman, she and the nuts worked up designs for television cameras and transmitters and receivers. Then she got money from her very rich mom to manufacture and market these satanic devices, which made imaginations redundant. They were instantly popular because the shows were so attractive and no thinking was involved.\nShe made a lot of money, but what really pleased her was that her two sisters were starting to feel like something the cat drug in. Young Booboolings didn\u2019t see any point in developing imaginations anymore, since all they had to do was turn on a switch and see all kinds of jazzy shit. They would look at a printed page or a painting and wonder how anybody could have gotten his or her rocks off looking at things that simple and dead.\nThe bad sister\u2019s name was Nim-nim. When her parents named her that, they had no idea how unsweet she was going to be. And TV wasn\u2019t the half of it! She was as unpopular as ever because she was as boring as ever, so she invented automobiles and computers and barbed wire and flamethrowers and land mines and machine guns and so on. That\u2019s how pissed off she was.\nNew generations of Booboolings grew up without imaginations. Their appetites for diversions from boredom were perfectly satisfied by all the crap Nim-nim was selling them. Why not? What the heck.\nWithout imaginations, though, they couldn\u2019t do what their ancestors had done, which was read interesting, heart-warming stories in the faces of one another. So, according to Kilgore Trout, \u201cBooboolings became among the most merciless creatures in the local family of galaxies.\u201d", 0.046950757575757555], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["helene", 0.11428571428571428], ["stella", 0.08571428571428572], ["going", 0.05714285714285714], ["fire", 0.05714285714285714], ["mf", 0.05714285714285714], ["doris", 0.05714285714285714], ["idea", 0.02857142857142857], ["horseback", 0.02857142857142857], ["dear", 0.02857142857142857], ["skyrockets", 0.02857142857142857], ["chair", 0.02857142857142857], ["afoot", 0.02857142857142857], ["shaw", 0.02857142857142857], ["sit", 0.02857142857142857], ["open", 0.02857142857142857], ["slammed", 0.02857142857142857], ["mouthful", 0.02857142857142857], ["door", 0.02857142857142857], ["forever", 0.02857142857142857], ["mouth", 0.02857142857142857], ["great", 0.02857142857142857], ["candles", 0.02857142857142857], ["pinwheels", 0.02857142857142857], ["looked", 0.02857142857142857], ["roman", 0.02857142857142857], ["left", 0.02857142857142857]], "sentiment": ["\"You said a mouthful!\" he said. \"I\u2019ll be going now....

She put the saucer on the kitchen table, turned out all the lights, and had me sit facing her across the table.\nAnd then she touched off the mixture with a match. The flame was almost pure yellow, a sodium flame, and it made her look like a corpse to me, made me look like a corpse to her.\n\u201cThere\u2014\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s what we\u2019ll look like when we\u2019re dead.\u201d\nThis queer demonstration not only scared me; it scared her, too. My mother scared herself with her own queerness, and from that moment on I ceased to be her companion. From that moment on she hardly spoke to me\u2014cut me dead, I\u2019m sure, out of fear of doing or saying something even crazier.\nAll that happened in Schenectady, before I was ten.\nIn 1923, when I was eleven, my father was assigned to the General Electric Office in Berlin, Germany.

We Humanists behave as honorably as we can without any expectations of rewards or punishments in an afterlife. We serve as best we can the only abstraction with which we have any real familiarity, which is our community.\nWe had a memorial service for Asimov a while back, and at one point I said, \u201cIsaac is up in Heaven now.\u201d That was the funniest thing I could have said to an audience of Humanists. I rolled them in the aisles. It was several minutes before order could be restored.\nIf I should ever die, again God forbid, I hope some of you will say, \u201cKurt\u2019s up in Heaven now.\u201d That\u2019s my favorite joke.\nHow do Humanists feel about Jesus? If what he said was superb, how can it matter whether he was God or not?\nWhen you get to my age, if you get to my age, and if you have reproduced, you will find yourself asking your own children, who are themselves middle-aged, what life is all about. I have seven kids, four of them adopted.\nMost of you here are the same age as my grandchildren. They, like you, are being royally shafted and lied to by our Baby Boomer corporations and government.\nI put my big question about life to my biological son Mark. Mark is a pediatrician, and author of a memoir entitled The Eden Express. It is about his crackup, straitjacket and padded cell stuff, from which he recovered sufficiently to graduate from Harvard Medical School.\nDr. Vonnegut said this to his doddering old dad: \u201cFather, we are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.\u201d So I pass that on to you.

It made a red puddle there.\nShe did not pick it up, since she believed that she had no more use for earthly things. But she was not yet ready for a star before her name.

still has no respect for my art collection, although, during the five weeks she has now been in residence, she has seen immensely respectable people from as far away as Switzerland and Japan worship some of them as though the pictures were gods almost. She was here when I sold a Rothko right off the wall to a man from the Getty Museum for a million and a half dollars.\nWhat she said about that was this: \u201cGood riddance of bad rubbish. It was rotting your brain because it was about absolutely nothing. Now give the rest of them the old heave-ho!\u201d\nShe asked me just now, while we were talking about the Survivor\u2019s Syndrome, if my father wanted to see the Turks punished for what they had done to the Armenians.\n\u201cI asked him the same thing when I was about eight years old, I guess, and thinking maybe life would be spicier if we wanted revenge of some kind,\u201d I said.\n\u201cFather put down his tools there in his little shop, and he stared out the window,\u201d I went on, \u201cand I looked out the window, too. There were a couple of Luma Indian men out there, I remember. The Luma reservation was only five miles away, and sometimes people passing through town would mistake me for a Luma boy. I liked that a lot. At the time I thought it certainly beat being an Armenian.\n\u201cFather finally answered my question this way: \u2018All I want from the Turks is an admission that their country is an uglier and even more joyless place, now that we are gone.\u2019\u201d\nI went for a manly tramp around my boundaries after lunch today, and encountered my neighbor to the north on our mutual border, which runs about twenty feet north of my potato barn. His name is John Karpinski. He is a native.

great Musical Festival. In 1882 he was invited by Das Deutsche Haus to come to Indianapolis to be musical director of the Maennerchor, in which position he remained until 1896.\n\u201cAt his last concert in that year at Tomlinson Hall he was given a standing ovation and was presented with a silver laurel wreath as an expression of appreciation of his great contribution to the musical life of the whole community. For the remaining twelve years of his life he gave instruction in piano and voice to selected pupils and was always held in highest esteem. His influence on the musical taste and sophistication of the whole city was incalculable. No one ever seems subsequently to have quite taken his place.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd Professor Karl Barus the musician, and his wife Alice begat another Alice Barus, who, according to Uncle John, \u201cis said to have been the most beautiful and accomplished young lady in Indianapolis. She played the piano and sang; also composed music, some of which was published.\u201d\nShe was my mother\u2019s mother.\nYes, and Peter Lieber, the limping war veteran, and his wife Sophia begat Albert Lieber, who became an Indianapolis brewer and bon vivant.\nHe was my mother\u2019s father.\nHenry Schnull, the merchant and banker, and his wife Matilda begat Nanette Schnull, who, according to Uncle John, \u201cwas a very beautiful woman in her prime, and had a lovely speaking and singing voice. She often sang in public. She laughed readily, enjoyed people, and was greatly admired by a host of friends.\u201d\nShe was my father\u2019s mother.\nAnd Clemens Vonnegut, the Free Thinker and founder of the Vonnegut Hardware Company, and his wife Katarina begat Bernard Vonnegut, who, Uncle John says, \u201cwas from earliest youth artistic. He could draw and paint with skill. Bernard was extremely modest and retiring. He had no intimates, and took but little part in social activities. He was never a happy, extroverted personality, but was inclined to be reticent, shy, and somewhat contemptuous of his environment.\u201d", 0.22352150537634408], "title": "Palm Sunday"},

pattern. A wife alone doesn\u2019t mean much. Curiously, a wife and just one child doesn\u2019t mean much, either.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOh, I suppose a few cases where a man has been unusually devoted to his mother or some other relative, or maybe even to his college, should be classified technically as the epizootic\u2014but cases like that aren\u2019t statistically important. To the epidemiologist who deals only in staggering figures, the epizootic is overwhelmingly a disease of successful, ambitious married men with more than one child.\u201d\nMillikan took no interest in their conversation. With monumental irrelevance, he now placed the photograph of his family in front of the two bachelors. It showed a quite ordinary mother with three quite ordinary children, one an infant. \u201cLook those wonderful people in the eye!\u201d he said hoarsely.\nBreed and Dr. Everett glanced at each other strickenly, then did as Millikan told them. They looked at the photograph bleakly, having just confirmed for each other the fact that Millikan was mortally ill with the epizootic.\n\u201cLook those wonderful people in the eye,\u201d said Millikan, as tragically resonant as the Ancient Mariner now. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve always been able to do\u2014until now,\u201d he said.\nBreed and Dr. Everett continued to look into the uninteresting eyes, preferring the sight of them to the sight of a man who was going to die very soon.\n\u201cLook at Robert!\u201d Millikan commanded, speaking of his eldest son. \u201cImagine having to tell that fine boy that he can\u2019t go to Andover anymore, that he\u2019s got to go to public school from now on! Look at Nancy!\u201d he commanded, speaking of his only daughter. \u201cNo more horse, no more sailboat, no more country club for her. And look at little Marvin in his dear mother\u2019s arms,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine bringing a baby into this world and then realizing that you won\u2019t be able to give it any advantages at all!\u201d His voice became jagged with self-torment and shame. \u201cThat poor little kid is going to have to fight every inch of the way!\u201d he said. \u201cThey all are. When American Reliable and Equitable goes smash, there isn\u2019t a thing their father will be able to do for them! Tooth and nail all the way for them!\u201d he cried.\nNow Millikan\u2019s voice became soft with horror. He invited the two bachelors to look at his wife\u2014a bland, lazy, plump dumpling, incidentally. \u201cImagine having a wonderful woman like that, a real pal who\u2019s stuck with you through thick and thin, who\u2019s borne your children and made a decent home for them,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine,\u201d he said after a long silence, \u201cimagine being a hero to her, imagine giving her all the things she\u2019s longed for all her life. And then imagine telling her,\u201d he whispered, \u201cthat you\u2019ve lost it all.\u201d\nMillikan sobbed. He ran from the boardroom into his office, took a loaded revolver from his desk. As Breed and Dr. Everett burst in upon him, he blew his brains out, thereby maturing life insurance policies in the amount of one cool million.\nAnd there lay one more case of the epizootic, the epidemic practice of committing suicide in order to create wealth.\n\u201cYou know\u2014\u201d said the chairman of the board, \u201cI used to wonder what was going to become of all the Americans like him, a bright and shiny new race that believed that life was a matter of making one\u2019s family richer and richer and richer, or it wasn\u2019t life. I often wondered what would become of them, if bad times ever came again, if the bright and shiny men suddenly discovered their net worths going down.\u201d Breed pointed to the floor.

I would be better received at Harvard, he said, if I had an Anglo-Saxon name. Thus did Walter F. Starbuck become my name.\nHe himself had done badly at Harvard, had scarcely squeaked through. He had also been scorned socially, not only for his stammer but for his being the obscenely rich son of an immigrant. There was every reason for him to hate Harvard\u2014but I watched him over the years so sentimentalize and romanticize, and finally so worship the place that, by the time I was in high school, he believed that Harvard professors were the wisest men in the history of the world. America could be paradise, if only all high posts in government were filled by Harvard men.\nAnd, as things turned out: When I went to work for the government as a bright young man in Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s Department of Agriculture, more and more posts were being filled by Harvard men. That seemed only right to me back then. It seems mildly comical to me now. Not even in prison as I say, is there anything special about Harvard men.\nWhile I was a student, I sometimes caught the whiff of a promise that, after I graduated, I would be better than average at explaining important matters to people who were slow at catching on. Things did not work out that way.\nSo there I sat in prison in Nineteen-hundred and Seventy-seven, waiting for the guard to come. I wasn\u2019t annoyed at his being an hour late so far. I was in no hurry to go anyplace, had no place in particular to go. The guard\u2019s name was Clyde Carter. He was one of the few friends I had made in prison. Our chief bond was that we had taken the same correspondence course in bartending from a diploma mill in Chicago, The Illinois Institute of Instruction, a division of The RAMJAC Corporation. On the same day and in the same mail each of us had received his Doctor of Mixology degree. Clyde had then surpassed me by taking the school\u2019s course in air conditioning, as well. Clyde was a third cousin to the President of the United States, Jimmy Carter. He was about five years younger than the President, but was otherwise his perfect spit and image. He had the same nice manners, the same bright smile.\nA degree in bartending was enough for me. That was all I intended to do with the rest of my life: tend a quiet bar somewhere, ideally in a club for gentlemen.\nAnd I lifted my old hands from the folded bedding and I clapped three times.\nAnother fighter plane leaped up from the tip of a nearby runway, tore the sky to shreds. I thought this: \u201cAt least I don\u2019t smoke anymore.\u201d It was true. I, who used to smoke four packages of unfiltered Pall Malls a day, was no longer a slave to King Nicotine. I would soon be reminded of how much I used to smoke, for the gray, pinstripe, three-piece Brooks Brothers suit awaiting me over in the supply room would be riddled with cigarette burns. There was a hole the size of a dime in the crotch, I remembered. A newspaper photograph was taken of me as I sat in the back of the federal marshal\u2019s green sedan, right after I was sentenced to prison. It was widely interpreted as showing how ashamed I was, haggard, horrified, unable to look anyone in the eye. It was in fact a photograph of a man who had just set his pants on fire.\nI thought now about Sacco and Vanzetti. When I was young, I believed that the story of their martyrdom would cause an irresistible mania for justice to the common people to spread throughout the world.

Paul.\n\u201cWell, as long as such a smart man as you is here, maybe I could get you to give me some advice for the boy. He just finished his National General Classification Tests. He just about killed himself studying up for them, but it wasn\u2019t any use. He didn\u2019t do nearly well enough for college. There were only twenty-seven openings, and six hundred kids trying for them.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to send him to a private school, so now he\u2019s got to decide what he\u2019s going to do with his life, Doctor: what\u2019s it going to be, the Army or the Reeks and Wrecks?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose there\u2019s a lot to be said for both,\u201d said Paul uncomfortably. \u201cI really don\u2019t know much about either one. Somebody else, like Matheson, maybe, would \u2026\u201d His sentence trailed off. Matheson was Ilium\u2019s manager in charge of testing and placement. Paul knew him slightly, didn\u2019t like him very well. Matheson was a powerful bureaucrat who went about his job with the air of a high priest. \u201cI\u2019ll call Matheson, if you like, and ask him, and let you know what he says.\u201d\n\u201cDoctor,\u201d said the man, desperately now, with no tinge of baiting, \u201cisn\u2019t there something the boy could do at the Works? He\u2019s awfully clever with his hands. He\u2019s got a kind of instinct with machines. Give him one he\u2019s never seen before, and in ten minutes he\u2019ll have it apart and back together again. He loves that kind of work. Isn\u2019t there someplace in the plant\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to have a graduate degree,\u201d said Paul. He reddened. \u201cThat\u2019s policy, and I didn\u2019t make it. Sometimes we get Reconstruction and Reclamation people over to help put in big machines or do a heavy repair job, but not very often. Maybe he could open a repair shop.\u201d\nThe man exhaled, slumped dejectedly. \u201cRepair shop,\u201d he sighed. \u201cRepair shop, he says. How many repair shops you think Ilium can support, eh? Repair shop, sure! I was going to open one when I got laid off. So was Joe, so was Sam, so was Alf. We\u2019re all clever with our hands, so we\u2019ll all open repair shops. One repairman for every broken article in Ilium. Meanwhile, our wives clean up as dressmakers\u2014one dressmaker for every woman in town.\u201d\nRudy Hertz had apparently missed all the talk and was still celebrating in his mind the happy reunion with his great and good friend, Doctor Paul Proteus. \u201cMusic,\u201d said Rudy grandly. \u201cLet\u2019s have music!\u201d He reached over Paul\u2019s shoulder and popped a nickel into the player piano.\nPaul stepped away from the box. Machinery whirred importantly for a few seconds, and then the piano started clanging away at \u201cAlexander\u2019s Ragtime Band\u201d liked cracked carillons. Mercifully, conversation was all but impossible. Mercifully, the bartender emerged from the basement and handed Paul a dusty bottle over the old heads.\nPaul turned to leave, and a powerful hand closed on his upper arm. Rudy, his expansive host, held him.\n\u201cI played this song in your honor, Doctor,\u201d shouted Rudy above the racket. \u201cWait till it\u2019s over.\u201d Rudy acted as though the antique instrument were the newest of all wonders, and he excitedly pointed out identifiable musical patterns in the bobbing keys\u2014trills, spectacular runs up the keyboard, and the slow, methodical rise and fall of keys in the bass. \u201cSee\u2014see them two go up and down, Doctor!

In Fuzz\u2019s mind, the desirable images all passed him by, avoided his ardent glances. Such beautiful creatures would have nothing to do with a man who was fubar.\nFuzz looked at Francine uneasily. Not only was she, so fresh and desirable from the Girl Pool, going to discover that her supervisor had a very poor job. She was going to conclude, as well, that her supervisor wasn\u2019t much of a man at all.\nThe normal morning workload in the General Company Response Section was about fifteen letters. On the morning that Francine Pefko joined the operation, however, there were only three letters to be answered.\nOne letter was from a man in a mental institution. He claimed to have squared the circle. He wanted a hundred thousand dollars and his freedom for having done it. Another letter was from a ten-year-old who wanted to pilot the first rocket ship to Mars. The third was from a lady who complained that she could not keep her dachshund from barking at her GF&F vacuum cleaner.\nBy ten o\u2019clock, Fuzz and Francine had disposed of all three letters. Francine filed the three letters and carbons of Fuzz\u2019s gracious replies. The filing cabinet was otherwise empty. The General Company Response Section had lost all its old files in the Building 181 fire.\nNow there was a lull.\nFrancine could hardly clean her typewriter, since her typewriter was brand new. Fuzz could hardly make busywork of shuffling gravely through papers, since he had only one paper in his desk. That one paper was a terse notice to the effect that all supervisors were to crack down hard on coffee breaks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all for right now?\u201d said Francine.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Fuzz. He searched her face for signs of derision. So far there were none. \u201cYou\u2014you happened to pick a slack morning,\u201d he said.", 0.07783910533910533], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["father",

county look stupid if it and its honest creator went on to the statewide competition in Cleveland. Our exhibit sure looked slick and tidy. Another big plus from the judges\u2019 point of view, maybe, when they thought about what the county\u2019s best was going to be up against in Cleveland: our exhibit was extremely hard for an ordinary person to understand or find at all interesting.\nI REMAINED PHILOSOPHICAL, thanks to marijuana and alcohol, while the community decided whether to crucify me as a fraud or to crown me as a genius. Father may have had a buzz on, too. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell. I served under 2 Generals in Vietnam who drank a quart of whiskey a day, but it was hard to detect. They always looked serious and dignified.\nSo off Father and I went to Cleveland. His spirits were high. I knew we would go smash up there. I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t know we would go smash up there. The only advice he gave me was to keep my shoulders back when I was explaining my exhibit and not to smoke where the judges might see me doing it. He was talking about ordinary cigarettes. He didn\u2019t know I smoked the other kind.\nI MAKE NO apologies for having been zapped during my darkest days in high school. Winston Churchill was bombed out of his skull on brandy and Cuban cigars during the darkest days of World War II.\nHITLER, OF COURSE, thanks to the advanced technology of Germany, was among the first human beings to turn their brains to cobwebs with amphetamine. He actually chewed on carpets, they say. Yum yum.\nMOTHER DID NOT come to Cleveland with Father and me. She was ashamed to leave the house, she was so big and fat. So I had to do most of the marketing after school. I also had to do most of the housework, she had so much trouble getting around. My familiarity with housework was useful at West Point, and then again when my mother-in-law and then my wife went nuts. It was actually sort of relaxing, because I could see that I had accomplished something undeniably good, and I didn\u2019t have to think about my troubles while I was doing it. How my mother\u2019s eyes used to shine when she saw what I had cooked for her!\nMy mother\u2019s story is 1 of the few real success stories in this book. She joined Weight Watchers when she was 60, which is my age now. When the ceiling fell on her at Niagara Falls, she weighed only 52 kilograms!\nTHIS LIBRARY IS full of stories of supposed triumphs, which makes me very suspicious of it. It\u2019s misleading for people to read about great successes, since even for middle-class and upper-class white people, in my experience, failure is the norm. It is unfair to youngsters particularly to leave them wholly unprepared for monster screw-ups and starring roles in Keystone Kop comedies and much, much worse.\nTHE OHIO SCIENCE Fair took place in Cleveland\u2019s beautiful Moellenkamp Auditorium. The theater seats had been removed and replaced with tables for all the exhibits. There was a hint of my then distant future in the auditorium\u2019s having been given to the city by the Moellenkamps, the same coal and shipping family that gave Tarkington College this library. This was long before they sold the boats and mines to a British and Omani consortium based in Luxembourg.\nBut the present was bad enough. Even as Father and I were setting up our exhibit, we were spotted by other contestants as a couple of comedians, as Laurel and Hardy, maybe, with Father as the fat and officious one and me as the dumb and skinny one. The thing was, Father was doing all the setting up, and I was standing around looking bored. All I wanted to do was go outside and hide behind a tree or something and smoke a cigarette. We were violating the most basic rule of the Fair, which was that the young exhibitors were supposed to do all the work, from start to finish.

You\u2019re perfectly normal,\u201d the instructor had said. \u201cBut let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t help you do a little better. Let\u2019s build an image, something pleasant, something we\u2019d like to remember. Smoke, oak tree, sedan\u2014I see a man relaxing under a leafy oak tree. He is smoking a pipe, and in the background is his car, a yellow sedan. See it, Mr. Moorhead?\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Alfred had seen it.\n\u201cGood. Now for \u2018bottle\u2019 and \u2018oriole.\u2019 By the man\u2019s side is a vacuum bottle of iced coffee, and an oriole is singing on a branch overhead. There, we can remember that happy picture without any trouble, eh?\u201d Alfred had nodded uncertainly. The instructor had gone on to other matters, then challenged him again.\n\u201cSmoke, sedan, bottle, uh\u2014\u201d Alfred had avoided the instructor\u2019s eyes.\nWhen the snickering of the class had subsided, the instructor had said, \u201cI suppose you think Mr. Moorhead has proved that mnemonics is bunk. Not at all. He has helped me to make another important point. The images used to help memory vary widely from person to person. Mr. Moorhead\u2019s personality is clearly different from mine. I shouldn\u2019t have forced my images on him. I\u2019ll repeat the list, Mr. Moorhead, and this time I want you to build a picture of your own.\u201d\nAt the end of the class, the instructor had called on Alfred again. Alfred had rattled the list off as though it were the alphabet.\nThe technique was so good, Alfred had reflected, that he would be able to recall the meaningless list for the rest of his life. He could still see himself and Rita Hayworth sharing a cigarette beneath a giant oak. He filled her glass from a bottle of excellent wine, and as she drank, an oriole brushed her cheek with its wing. Then Alfred kissed her. As for \u201csedan,\u201d he had lent it to Aly Khan.\nRewards for his new faculty had been splendid and immediate.
