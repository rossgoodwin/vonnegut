It was about a fugitive who sought shelter from the police in the home of a woman he knew.\n\u201cHer living room had a cathedral ceiling, which is to say it went all the way up to the roof peak, with rustic rafters spanning the air space below.\u201d Trout paused.

But before he could put them on, the police were hammering on the front door with their billy clubs. So the fugitive hid on top of a rafter. When the woman let in the police, though, his oversize testicles hung down in full view.\u201d\nTrout paused again.\n\u201cThe police asked the woman where the guy was. The woman said she didn\u2019t know what guy they were talking about,\u201d said Trout. \u201cOne of the cops saw the testicles hanging down from a rafter and asked what they were. She said they were Chinese temple bells. He believed her. He said he\u2019d always wanted to hear Chinese temple bells.\n\u201cHe gave them a whack with his billy club, but there was no sound.

years as an odd duck and recluse in Greenwich Village, I lived on about four dollars a day, rent included, and I even had a television set.\nMy new furnishings were all war surplus, like myself\u2014a narrow steel cot, olive-drab blankets with \u201cU.S.A.\u201d on them, folding canvas chairs, mess kits to cook in and eat out of. Even my library was largely war surplus, coming as it did from recreation kits intended for troops overseas.\nAnd, since phonograph records came in these unused kits, too, I got myself a war-surplus, weather-proofed, portable phonograph, guaranteed to play in any climate from the Bering Straits to the Arafura Sea. By buying the recreation kits, each one a sealed pig-in-a-poke, I came into possession of twenty-six recordings of Bing Crosby\u2019s \u201cWhite Christmas.\u201d\nMy overcoat, my raincoat, my jacket, my socks and my underwear were war surplus, too.\nBy buying a war-surplus first-aid kit for a dollar, I also came into possession of a quantity of morphine. The buzzards in the war-surplus business were so glutted with carrion as to have overlooked it.\nI was tempted to take the morphine, reflecting that, if it made me feel happy, I would, after all, have enough money to support the habit. But then I understood that I was already drugged.\nI was feeling no pain.\nMy narcotic was what had got me through the war; it was an ability to let my emotions be stirred by only one thing\u2014my love for Helga. This concentration of my emotions on so small an area had begun as a young lover\u2019s happy illusion, had developed into a device to keep me from going insane during the war, and had finally become the permanent axis about which my thoughts revolved.\nAnd so, with my Helga presumed dead, I became a death-worshipper, as content as any narrow-minded religious nut anywhere. Always alone, I drank toasts to her, said good morning to her, said good night to her, played music for her, and didn\u2019t give a damn for one thing else.\nAnd then one day in 1958, after thirteen years of living like that, I bought a war-surplus wood-carving set. It was surplus not from the Second World War but from the Korean war.

Now can I have my hand back?\u201d\n\u201cI love you, Hope,\u201d said Haley, his face hot beneath his sunburn.\nHope looked alarmed and tugged to free her hand, but Haley only clasped it more tightly. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said finally.

Hide!\u201d He slid aside the bale that blocked the tunnel entrance, and crawled into the secret chamber. Hope followed, pulling the bale back into place, remaining prone in the tunnel. They lay motionless in the darkness, their hearts throbbing against the floor.\nSuddenly the cough came again \u2014 explosive and sharp in Haley\u2019s ear. \u201cRun!\u201d he shouted. His cry ended in a gurgle, as a pair of powerful arms closed over his throat and chest. He drove his head backwards into the face of his assailant, and struck out with the steel-shod heels of his work shoes. The arms relaxed for an instant. Haley wriggled free and scrambled for the exit. The portal bale was tumbled to one side, leaving a square of light to guide him. Hope had fled.\nPanting heavily, he thrust his head and shoulders through the doorway. Hands seized his ankles, and started to drag him back in. He kicked again, savagely, rolled from the tunnel, and raced down the channel between bales, down the loft ladder, and toward the house.\nHope\u2019s silhouette danced before him, sprinting up the kitchen steps. She cried for help as she ran. Haley turned his head to look quickly at the black hole of the barn door, to see a figure dart from it, and to lengthen his panic-driven stride and shout, \u201cHe\u2019s after us!\u201d\nHe overtook Hope as she rushed through the darkened kitchen, and the two of them burst into the sunroom together. The General was on his feet, and Annie\u2019s eyes were wide with terror.\n\u201cBanghart!\u201d panted Haley, pointing toward the barn. The General snatched his pistol belt from the tabletop, and fumbled with the catch on the holster. \u201cKeep calm,\u201d he commanded. \u201cIf I can\u2019t handle this, the police can. I phoned them right after supper, and they\u2019ll be here any minute.\u201d\n\u201cDrop it,\u201d ordered a voice from the kitchen shadows. The pistol fell back on the table with a thump. Annie whimpered. Haley turned to face the speaker. Mr. Banghart winked at him over the sights of the shotgun they had left leaning against the kitchen doorframe. He stepped into the light, and, as he swung the muzzle from Haley to the General, Haley saw his face as a red-eyed nightmare, sweat-streaked with the brown dust of the barn, and bristling with stiff, glistening beard.\n\u201cHaley, now don\u2019t you and the girls be scared,\u201d said Mr. Banghart, nervously apologetic. \u201cIt\u2019s the old devil I\u2019m here to settle up with. One shot\u2019s all I\u2019ve got, and that\u2019s for his honor over there.\u201d\nAnnie, Hope, and Haley had flattened themselves against the wall to Mr. Banghart\u2019s right. The General stood alone in the middle of the room, rigid, unblinking. \u201cBanghart, I order you to put that gun down this instant,\u201d he said, glaring.", 0.03652073732718893], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["billy", 0.07216494845360824], ["colonel", 0.05154639175257732], ["coughed", 0.041237113402061855], ["weary", 0.030927835051546393], ["regiment", 0.030927835051546393], ["sergeants", 0.020618556701030927], ["fifty", 0.020618556701030927], ["majors", 0.020618556701030927], ["dying", 0.020618556701030927], ["outfit", 0.020618556701030927], ["boys", 0.020618556701030927], ["wild", 0.020618556701030927], ["bob", 0.020618556701030927], ["silence", 0.020618556701030927], ["stood", 0.010309278350515464], ["cried", 0.010309278350515464], ["pilgrim", 0.010309278350515464], ["wetly", 0.010309278350515464], ["prisoners", 0.010309278350515464], ["infantry", 0.010309278350515464], ["people", 0.010309278350515464], ["rank", 0.010309278350515464], ["high", 0.010309278350515464], ["fever", 0.010309278350515464], ["paper", 0.010309278350515464], ["sense", 0.010309278350515464], ["children", 0.010309278350515464], ["bags", 0.010309278350515464], ["vertigo", 0.010309278350515464], ["dipped", 0.010309278350515464], ["troops", 0.010309278350515464], ["colonels", 0.010309278350515464], ["remember", 0.010309278350515464], ["question", 0.010309278350515464], ["forty", 0.010309278350515464], ["long", 0.010309278350515464], ["wasn", 0.010309278350515464], ["squad", 0.010309278350515464], ["call", 0.010309278350515464], ["lot", 0.010309278350515464], ["reply", 0.010309278350515464], ["staring", 0.010309278350515464], ["greasy", 0.010309278350515464], ["eyes", 0.010309278350515464], ["full", 0.010309278350515464], ["roland", 0.010309278350515464], ["lungs", 0.010309278350515464], ["rattled", 0.010309278350515464], ["agony", 0.010309278350515464], ["men", 0.010309278350515464], ["inhaled", 0.010309278350515464], ["halted", 0.010309278350515464], ["feet", 0.010309278350515464], ["hear", 0.010309278350515464], ["listening", 0.010309278350515464], ["wanted", 0.010309278350515464], ["sorted", 0.010309278350515464], ["railroad", 0.010309278350515464], ["hold", 0.010309278350515464], ["germans", 0.010309278350515464], ["pneumonia", 0.010309278350515464], ["entire", 0.010309278350515464], ["drowning", 0.010309278350515464], ["yard", 0.010309278350515464], ["couldn", 0.010309278350515464], ["lost", 0.010309278350515464], ["double", 0.010309278350515464], ["steady", 0.010309278350515464], ["man", 0.010309278350515464], ["time", 0.010309278350515464], ["swooped", 0.010309278350515464]], "sentiment": ["The Germans sorted out the prisoners according to rank.

There were still quite a few when I first came here. I recall the testimony of some people who had lived in one to the effect that the isolation, the like-mindedness, the routines and so on were suffocating.\nI can believe it. I myself never visited one, unless you want to count the Anthropology Department itself.\nBut I had certainly read about a lot of them in the library here. It seemed to me that they, because of their simplicity and isolation, might be regarded as petri dishes in which human beings might demonstrate certain apparently basic human needs other than food, shelter, clothing, and sex. For want of a better word, I will call such needs spiritual, by which I mean only that they are invisible, un-smellable, inaudible, intangible, and inedible.\nWas it possible, I wondered, that certain features common to all of them not only revealed spiritual needs of all human beings, including those of us in this auditorium? Might not those features also show us methods for satisfying those needs, theatrical performances, if you will, which human beings, by their nature, can ill-afford to do without?\nI think of the British Navy, whose sailors, although filling the world\u2019s oceans, felt lousy all the time, until they started sucking limes. A vitamin deficiency, of course! And here we are in the post-industrial, post-Cold War whatchamacallit, feeling lousy all the time. We get all the minerals and vitamins we need. Is it conceivable that we are suffering from a cultural deficiency which we can remedy? Friends and neighbors, I say YES to that:\nLet\u2019s give everybody a totem at birth. What proof do I have that even highly educated people need nonsensical, arbitrary symbols which will relate them to other people and the Earth and the Universe? I am a Scorpio. Would those of you who are also Scorpios please hold up your hands? Lookee there! Dostoyevsky was one of us!\nYes, and let\u2019s find a way to get ourselves and others extended families again. A husband and a wife and some kids aren\u2019t a family, any more than a diet Pepsi and three Oreos is a breakfast. Twenty, thirty, forty people\u2014that\u2019s a family. Marriages are all busting up. Why? Mates are saying to each other, because they\u2019re human, \u201cYou\u2019re not enough people for me.\u201d\nYes, and let\u2019s make sure every American gets a puberty ceremony, an impressive welcome to the rights and duties of grown-ups. As matters now stand, only practicing Jews get those. The only way the rest of us can feel like grown-ups is to get pregnant or get somebody else pregnant, or commit a felony or go to war and then come back again.\nI only want to say in closing that it\u2019s nice to be home again.\nHOW VONNEGUT LEARNED FROM A TEACHER \u201cWHAT ARTISTS DO\u201d", 0.07993148561507937], "title": "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["ortiz", 0.04], ["teeth", 0.04], ["macintosh", 0.032], ["years", 0.024], ["human", 0.024], ["brain", 0.016], ["big", 0.016], ["people", 0.016], ["hisako", 0.016], ["thirty", 0.016], ["toothless", 0.016], ["time", 0.016], ["died", 0.016], ["dog", 0.016], ["selection", 0.008], ["chain", 0.008], ["serving", 0.008], ["telling", 0.008], ["captain", 0.008], ["rot", 0.008], ["suicide", 0.008], ["pardon", 0.008], ["young", 0.008], ["going", 0.008], ["main", 0.008], ["humanity", 0.008], ["good", 0.008], ["front", 0.008], ["evolution", 0.008], ["solution", 0.008], ["entirely", 0.008], ["abscesses", 0.008], ["straighten", 0.008], ["machines", 0.008], ["body", 0.008], ["nature", 0.008], ["confusion", 0.008], ["hepburn", 0.008], ["completely", 0.008], ["cut", 0.008], ["surely", 0.008], ["santa", 0.008], ["selena", 0.008], ["care", 0.008], ["universe", 0.008], ["mouthfuls", 0.008], ["practical", 0.008], ["opinion", 0.008], ["misbehavior", 0.008], ["simply", 0.008], ["drilled", 0.008], ["total", 0.008], ["tools", 0.008], ["market", 0.008], ["jes", 0.008], ["story", 0.008], ["law", 0.008], ["span", 0.008], ["durable", 0.008], ["lot", 0.008], ["mary", 0.008], ["life", 0.008], ["dentists", 0.008], ["pains", 0.008], ["filet", 0.008], ["andrew", 0.008], ["pact", 0.008], ["kind", 0.008], ["favors", 0.008], ["beg", 0.008], ["future", 0.008], ["criticizing", 0.008], ["problem", 0.008], ["lifetime", 0.008], ["sir", 0.008], ["drained", 0.008], ["floor", 0.008], ["hiroguchi", 0.008], ["write", 0.008], ["events", 0.008], ["nice", 0.008], ["mignons", 0.008], ["intended", 0.008], ["crockery", 0.008], ["visits", 0.008], ["wrong", 0.008], ["regular", 0.008], ["arrived", 0.008], ["guayaquil", 0.008], ["ago", 0.008], ["rosalia", 0.008], ["short", 0.008], ["natural", 0.008], ["rotting", 0.008], ["average", 0.008], ["tooth", 0.008], ["points", 0.008], ["bodies", 0.008], ["english", 0.008], ["revising", 0.008], ["draconian", 0.008]], "sentiment": ["Really.

Gregory would have had to make me an Anglo-Saxon.\nHe could have used my head in a story about Indians. I would have made a passable Hiawatha. He illustrated an expensive edition of Hiawatha one time, and the model he used for the title character was the son of a Greek fry cook.\nIn the movies back then, just about any big-nosed person whose ancestors came from the shores of the Mediterranean or the Near East, if he could act a little, could play a rampaging Sioux or whatever. The audiences were more than satisfied.\nNow I yearned to get back on the railroad train! I had been so happy there! How I adored that train! God Almighty Himself must have been hilarious when human beings so mingled iron and water and fire as to make a railroad train!\nNowadays, of course, everything must be done with plutonium and laser beams.\nAnd could Dan Gregory ever paint pictures of railroad trains! He used to work from blueprints he got from the manufacturers, so that a misplaced rivet or whatever wouldn\u2019t spoil his picture for a railroad man. And if he had done a picture of the Twentieth Century Limited the day I arrived, the stains and dirt on the outside would be native to the run between Chicago and New York. Nobody could paint grime like Dan Gregory.\nAnd where was he now? Where was Marilee? Why hadn\u2019t they sent someone to meet me with his great Marmon touring car?\nHe knew exactly when I was coming. He was the one who had picked the date, an easy one to remember. It was Saint Valentine\u2019s Day. And he had done me so many kindnesses through the mail, and not through Marilee or any flunky. All the messages were in his own handwriting. They were brief, but they were incredibly generous, too. I was not only to buy a warm suit for myself at his expense, but one for Father, too.\nHis notes were so compassionate! He didn\u2019t want me to get scared or make a fool of myself on the trains, so he told me how to act in a Pullman berth and on the dining car, and how much and when to tip the waiters and porters, and how to change trains in Chicago. He couldn\u2019t have been nicer to his own son, if he had had a son.", 0.17906399156399155], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "a-man-without-a-country": {"tfidf": [["saab", 0.021660649819494584], ["engine",

opinion one way or the other.\u201d\n\u201cWe are killing this planet as a life-support system with the poisons from all the thermodynamic whoopee we\u2019re making with atomic energy and fossil fuels, and everybody knows it, and practically nobody cares. This is how crazy we are. I think the planet\u2019s immune system is trying to get rid of us with AIDS and new strains of flu and tuberculosis, and so on. I think the planet should get rid of us. We\u2019re really awful animals. I mean, that dumb Barbra Streisand song, \u2018People who need people are the luckiest people in the world\u2019\u2014she\u2019s talking about cannibals. Lots to eat. Yes, the planet is trying to get rid of us, but I think it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nAnd I said good-bye to my friend, hung up the phone, sat down and wrote this epitaph: \u201cThe good Earth\u2014we could have saved it, but we were too damn cheap and lazy.\u201d\n12\nI used to be the owner and manager of an automobile dealership in West Barnstable, Massachusetts, called Saab Cape Cod. It and I went out of business thirty-three years ago. The Saab then, as now, was a Swedish car, and I now believe my failure as a dealer so long ago explains what would otherwise remain a deep mystery: Why the Swedes have never given me a Nobel Prize for Literature. Old Norwegian proverb: \u201cSwedes have short dicks but long memories.\u201d\nListen: The Saab back then had only one model, a bug like a VW, a two-door sedan, but with the engine in front. It had suicide doors opening into the slipstream. Unlike all other cars, but like your lawnmower and your outboard, it had a two-stroke rather than a four-stroke engine. So every time you filled your tank with gas, you had to pour in a can of oil as well. For whatever reason, straight women did not want to do this.\nThe chief selling point was that a Saab could drag a VW at a stoplight. But if you or your significant other had failed to add oil to the last tank of gas, you and the car would then become fireworks. It also had front-wheel drive, of some help on slippery pavements or when accelerating into curves. There was this as well: As one prospective customer said to me, \u201cThey make the best watches. Why wouldn\u2019t they make the best cars, too?\u201d I was bound to agree.\nThe Saab back then was a far cry from the sleek, powerful, four-stroke yuppie uniform it is today. It was the wet dream, if you like, of engineers in an airplane factory who\u2019d never made a car before. Wet dream, did I say? Get a load of this: There was a ring on the dashboard, connected to a chain running over pulleys in the engine compartment. Pull on it, and at the far end it would raise a sort of window shade on a spring-loaded roller behind the front grill. That was to keep the engine warm while you went off somewhere. So, when you came back, if you hadn\u2019t stayed away too long, the engine would start right up again.\nBut if you stayed away too long, window shade or not, the oil would separate from the gas and sink like molasses to the bottom of the tank. So when you started up again, you would lay down a smokescreen like a destroyer in a naval engagement. And I actually blacked out the whole town of Woods Hole at high noon that way, having left a Saab in a parking lot there for about a week. I am told old timers there still wonder out loud about where all that smoke could have come from. I came to speak ill of Swedish engineering, and so diddled myself out of a Nobel Prize.\nIt\u2019s damn hard to make jokes work. In Cat\u2019s Cradle, for instance, there are these very short chapters. Each one of them represents one day\u2019s work, and each one is a joke. If I were writing about a tragic situation, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to time it to make sure the thing works. You can\u2019t really misfire with a tragic scene. It\u2019s bound to be moving if all the right elements are present. But a joke is like building a mousetrap from scratch.

We are all embarrassed. We Americans have guided our destinies so clumsily, with all the world watching, that we must now protect ourselves against our own government and our own industries.\n\u201cNot to do so would be suicide. We have discovered a brand-new method for committing suicide\u2014family style, Reverend Jim Jones style, and by the millions. What is the method? To say nothing and do nothing about what some of our businessmen and military men are doing with the most unstable substances and the most persistent poisons to be found anywhere in the universe.\n\u201cThe people who play with such chemicals are so dumb!\n\u201cThey are also vicious. How vicious it is of them to tell us as little as possible about the hideousness of nuclear weapons and power plants!\n\u201cAnd, among all the dumb and vicious people, who jeopardizes all life on earth with hearts so light? I suggest to you that it is those who will lie for the nuclear industries, or who will teach their executives how to lie convincingly\u2014for a fee. I speak of certain lawyers and communicators, and all public relations experts. The so-called profession of public relations, an American invention, stands entirely disgraced today.\n\u201cThe lies we have been fed about nuclear energy have been as cunningly handcrafted as the masterpieces of Benvenuto Cellini. They have been a damned sight better built, I must say, than the atomic energy plants themselves.\n\u201cI say to you that the makers of such lies are filthy little monkeys. I hate them. They may think they are cute. They are not cute. They stink. If we let them, they will kill everything on this lovely blue-green planet with their rebuttals to what we say here today\u2014with their vicious, stupid lies.\u201d\n4\nTRIAGE\nI WAS EDUCATED SOME in chemistry, and in biology and physics, too, at Cornell University.

She stayed, clenching and unclenching her hands.\n\u201cSoup\u2019s getting cold,\u201d said Paul, as kindly as possible. He sat down on the bench, with the three glasses between them. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn whether you told them I was going to pieces or not.\u201d Anita stood a dozen yards away, silhouetted against the French doors.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you\u2019d get sore as hell about it,\u201d said Sheperd. \u201cI told them, all right.

When Shepherd had first arrived in Ilium, he had announced to his fellow new arrivals, Paul and Finnerty, that he intended to compete with them. Baldly, ridiculously, he talked of competitiveness and rehashed with anyone who would listen various crises where there had been a showdown between his abilities and those of someone else, crises that the other participants had looked upon as being routine, unremarkable, and generally formless. But, to Shepherd, life seemed to be laid out like a golf course, with a series of beginnings, hazards, and ends, and with a definite summing up\u2014for comparison with others scores\u2014after each hole. He was variously grim or elated over triumphs or failures no one else seemed to notice, but always stoical about the laws that governed the game. He asked no quarter, gave no quarter, and made very little difference to Paul, Finnerty, or any of his other associates. He was a fine engineer, dull company, and doggedly master of his fate and not his brother\u2019s keeper.\nPaul, fidgeting silently on the bench, tried to put himself in Shepherd\u2019s place. Shepherd had lost a round, and now, grimly respectful of the mechanics of the competitive system, he wanted to pay the forfeit for losing and get on to the next episode, which he was, as always, determined to win. It was a hard world he lived in, but he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.

The lesson I myself learned over and over again when teaching at the college and then the prison was the uselessness of information to most people, except as entertainment. If facts weren\u2019t funny or scary, or couldn\u2019t make you rich, the heck with them.\nWHEN I LATER went to work at the prison, I encountered a mass murderer named Alton Darwin who also could do arithmetic in his head. He was Black. Unlike Claudia Roosevelt, he was highly intelligent in the verbal area. The people he had murdered were rivals or deadbeats or police informers or cases of mistaken identity or innocent bystanders in the illegal drug industry. His manner of speaking was elegant and thought-provoking.\nHe hadn\u2019t killed nearly as many people as I had. But then again, he hadn\u2019t had my advantage, which was the full cooperation of our Government.\nAlso, he had done all his killing for reasons of money. I had never stooped to that.\nWhen I found out that he could do arithmetic in his head, I said to him, \u201cThat\u2019s a remarkable gift you have.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem fair, does it,\u201d he said, \u201cthat somebody should come into the world with such a great advantage over the common folk? When I get out of here, I\u2019m going to buy me a pretty striped tent and put up a sign saying \u2018One dollar. Come on in and see the Nigger do arithmetic.\u2019 \u201d He wasn\u2019t ever going to get out of there. He was serving a life sentence without hope of parole.\nDARWIN\u2019S FANTASY ABOUT starring in a mental-arithmetic show when he got out, incidentally, was inspired by something 1 of his great-grandfathers did in South Carolina after World War I. All the airplane pilots back then were white, and some of them did stunt flying at country fairs. They were called \u201cbarnstormers.\u201d\nAnd 1 of these barnstormers with a 2-cockpit plane strapped Darwin\u2019s great-grandfather in the front cockpit, even though the great-grandfather couldn\u2019t even drive an automobile. The barnstormer crouched down in the rear cockpit, so people couldn\u2019t see him but he could still work the controls. And people came from far and wide, according to Darwin, \u201cto see the Nigger fly the airplane.\u201d\nHe was only 25 years old when we first met, the same age as Lowell Chung when Lowell won the Bronze Medal for horseback riding in Seoul, South Korea. When I was 25, I hadn\u2019t killed anybody yet, and hadn\u2019t had nearly as many women as Darwin had. When he was only 20, he told me, he paid cash for a Ferrari. I didn\u2019t have a car of my own, which was a good car, all right, a Chevrolet Corvette, but nowhere near as good as a Ferrari, until I was 21.\nAt least I, too, had paid cash.", 0.23752681252681246], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["national", 0.044444444444444446], ["telephone", 0.044444444444444446], ["colonel", 0.044444444444444446], ["philadelphia", 0.044444444444444446], ["steel", 0.044444444444444446], ["foundry", 0.044444444444444446], ["ringing", 0.022222222222222223], ["family", 0.022222222222222223], ["raged", 0.022222222222222223], ["telegram", 0.022222222222222223], ["fifty", 0.022222222222222223], ["rid", 0.022222222222222223], ["hellbrunner", 0.022222222222222223], ["figure", 0.022222222222222223], ["sell", 0.022222222222222223], ["office", 0.022222222222222223], ["unlocked", 0.022222222222222223], ["forty", 0.022222222222222223], ["going", 0.022222222222222223], ["lord", 0.022222222222222223], ["care", 0.022222222222222223], ["shrill", 0.022222222222222223], ["firm", 0.022222222222222223], ["woman", 0.022222222222222223], ["door", 0.022222222222222223], ["monster", 0.022222222222222223], ["price", 0.022222222222222223], ["polite", 0.022222222222222223], ["bangkok", 0.022222222222222223], ["moment", 0.022222222222222223], ["reply", 0.022222222222222223], ["silent", 0.022222222222222223], ["peckham", 0.022222222222222223], ["voice", 0.022222222222222223], ["thirty", 0.022222222222222223], ["yup", 0.022222222222222223], ["bargain", 0.022222222222222223], ["morning", 0.022222222222222223], ["prayerful", 0.022222222222222223]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYup,\u201d I said.\nThe next morning, the telephone was ringing when I unlocked my office door.\nIt was Mrs. Hellbrunner.
