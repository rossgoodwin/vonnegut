It is a harrowing sort of truth which I myself could never write about. It reminds me yet again that my own work is in full flight from truth, having thrown its pack and rifle away.\nI have never studied literature systematically, having been a chemist and an anthropologist. I have picked the brains of friends who have read a lot more than I have, and continue to do so. Dubin\u2019s opinions on Thoreau and Lawrence are now my own. One thing Dubin fails to say, or he said it and I missed it, is that Lawrence himself liked to consider strong authors in unlikely pairs. Isn\u2019t that so?\nIf you have ever worried about growing weaker as you grew older, you need not have worried. You\u2019re about twice as strong as anybody else writing these days.\nMay I add that I, too, like Dubin, have been to Venice with a woman not my wife.\nAnd I apologize yet again for not having come to your Christmas party so long ago now. I was paralyzed by depression.\nCheers\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut\nP.S.: Why does Venice mean so little to women?", 0.16410256410256407], "title": "Letters"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["day", 0.031496062992125984], ["tornadoes", 0.023622047244094488], ["hands", 0.015748031496062992], ["earth", 0.015748031496062992], ["blue", 0.015748031496062992], ["numerous", 0.015748031496062992], ["weather", 0.015748031496062992], ["altitude", 0.015748031496062992], ["white", 0.015748031496062992], ["frost", 0.015748031496062992], ["manhole", 0.015748031496062992], ["winter", 0.015748031496062992], ["locking", 0.015748031496062992], ["mouths", 0.015748031496062992], ["moment", 0.015748031496062992], ["squeak", 0.015748031496062992], ["summer", 0.007874015748031496], ["atmosphere", 0.007874015748031496], ["dynamic", 0.007874015748031496], ["stability", 0.007874015748031496], ["mile", 0.007874015748031496], ["touch", 0.007874015748031496], ["ground", 0.007874015748031496], ["death", 0.007874015748031496], ["deathly", 0.007874015748031496], ["bicycled", 0.007874015748031496], ["zone", 0.007874015748031496], ["lorenzo", 0.007874015748031496], ["easy", 0.007874015748031496], ["listened", 0.007874015748031496], ["half", 0.007874015748031496], ["locked", 0.007874015748031496], ["gobbled", 0.007874015748031496], ["reticent", 0.007874015748031496], ["perceived", 0.007874015748031496], ["sighed", 0.007874015748031496], ["warned", 0.007874015748031496], ["freshness", 0.007874015748031496], ["dismounted", 0.007874015748031496], ["told", 0.007874015748031496], ["lifted", 0.007874015748031496], ["spring", 0.007874015748031496], ["lips", 0.007874015748031496], ["crescent", 0.007874015748031496], ["bad", 0.007874015748031496], ["filled", 0.007874015748031496], ["movement", 0.007874015748031496], ["remembered", 0.007874015748031496], ["stared", 0.007874015748031496], ["water", 0.007874015748031496], ["gnashed", 0.007874015748031496], ["step", 0.007874015748031496], ["gravelly", 0.007874015748031496], ["straightened", 0.007874015748031496], ["directions", 0.007874015748031496], ["suggested", 0.007874015748031496], ["mona", 0.007874015748031496], ["climbed", 0.007874015748031496], ["days", 0.007874015748031496], ["times", 0.007874015748031496], ["loudly", 0.007874015748031496], ["narrow", 0.007874015748031496], ["sweetness", 0.007874015748031496], ["number", 0.007874015748031496], ["sincerely", 0.007874015748031496], ["withdrawn", 0.007874015748031496], ["smells", 0.007874015748031496], ["canteens", 0.007874015748031496], ["sheet", 0.007874015748031496], ["three", 0.007874015748031496], ["wildly", 0.007874015748031496], ["sort", 0.007874015748031496], ["dry", 0.007874015748031496], ["head", 0.007874015748031496], ["season", 0.007874015748031496], ["glass", 0.007874015748031496], ["hole", 0.007874015748031496], ["helped", 0.007874015748031496], ["stabilized", 0.007874015748031496], ["tank", 0.007874015748031496], ["discretely", 0.007874015748031496], ["air", 0.007874015748031496], ["remain", 0.007874015748031496], ["protected", 0.007874015748031496], ["iron", 0.007874015748031496], ["making", 0.007874015748031496], ["proof", 0.007874015748031496], ["san", 0.007874015748031496], ["cover", 0.007874015748031496], ["autumn", 0.007874015748031496], ["heard", 0.007874015748031496], ["rungs", 0.007874015748031496], ["tight", 0.007874015748031496], ["hot", 0.007874015748031496], ["fourth", 0.007874015748031496], ["tornado", 0.007874015748031496], ["mother", 0.007874015748031496], ["mouth", 0.007874015748031496], ["seasons", 0.007874015748031496], ["unlocking", 0.007874015748031496], ["varied", 0.007874015748031496], ["temperate", 0.007874015748031496], ["forever", 0.007874015748031496], ["longer", 0.007874015748031496], ["sniffed", 0.007874015748031496], ["echoed", 0.007874015748031496], ["shook", 0.007874015748031496], ["time", 0.007874015748031496]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\nWhen I\u2019d bicycled our atmosphere to sweetness and freshness, I dismounted and climbed the iron rungs to see what the weather was like above. I did that several times a day. On that day, the fourth day, I perceived through the narrow crescent of the lifted manhole cover that the weather had become somewhat stabilized.\nThe stability was of a wildly dynamic sort, for the tornadoes were as numerous as ever, and tornadoes remain numerous to this day. But their mouths no longer gobbled and gnashed at the earth. The mouths in all directions were discretely withdrawn to an altitude of perhaps a half of a mile. And their altitude varied so little from moment to moment that San Lorenzo might have been protected by a tornado-proof sheet of glass.\nWe let three more days go by, making certain that the tornadoes had become as sincerely reticent as they seemed. And then we filled canteens from our water tank and we went above.\nThe air was dry and hot and deathly still.\nI had heard it suggested one time that the seasons in the temperate zone ought to be six rather than four in number: summer, autumn, locking, winter, unlocking, and spring. And I remembered that as I straightened up beside our manhole, and stared and listened and sniffed.\nThere were no smells. There was no movement. Every step I took made a gravelly squeak in blue-white frost. And every squeak was echoed loudly. The season of locking was over. The earth was locked up tight.\nIt was winter, now and forever.\nI helped my Mona out of our hole. I warned her to keep her hands away from the blue-white frost and to keep her hands away from her mouth, too. \u201cDeath has never been quite so easy to come by,\u201d I told her. \u201cAll you have to do is touch the ground and then your lips and you\u2019re done for.\u201d\nShe shook her head and sighed. \u201cA very bad mother.\u201d", 0.0344107142857143], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["paul", 0.046153846153846156], ["shirt", 0.03076923076923077], ["body", 0.015384615384615385], ["quietly", 0.015384615384615385], ["contentious", 0.015384615384615385], ["plainly", 0.015384615384615385], ["wouldn", 0.015384615384615385], ["underbrush", 0.015384615384615385], ["heated", 0.015384615384615385], ["turned", 0.015384615384615385], ["delighted", 0.015384615384615385], ["hollow", 0.015384615384615385], ["unexpectedly", 0.015384615384615385], ["proves", 0.015384615384615385], ["adultery", 0.015384615384615385], ["wasn", 0.015384615384615385], ["hell", 0.015384615384615385], ["love", 0.015384615384615385], ["guess", 0.015384615384615385], ["stainless", 0.015384615384615385], ["coupled", 0.015384615384615385], ["fornication", 0.015384615384615385], ["rubber", 0.015384615384615385], ["tears", 0.015384615384615385], ["book", 0.015384615384615385], ["damn", 0.015384615384615385], ["wrongdoing", 0.015384615384615385], ["laughed", 0.015384615384615385], ["answer", 0.015384615384615385], ["covered", 0.015384615384615385], ["darling", 0.015384615384615385], ["primly", 0.015384615384615385], ["burst", 0.015384615384615385], ["listen", 0.015384615384615385], ["wearing", 0.015384615384615385], ["shepherd", 0.015384615384615385], ["semblance", 0.015384615384615385], ["advantage", 0.015384615384615385], ["lend", 0.015384615384615385], ["rattled", 0.015384615384615385], ["symptomatic", 0.015384615384615385], ["underneath", 0.015384615384615385], ["bluff", 0.015384615384615385], ["coming", 0.015384615384615385], ["inconceivable", 0.015384615384615385], ["glad", 0.015384615384615385], ["man", 0.015384615384615385], ["steel", 0.015384615384615385], ["sponge", 0.015384615384615385], ["woman", 0.015384615384615385], ["finnerty", 0.015384615384615385], ["shaped", 0.015384615384615385], ["boring", 0.015384615384615385], ["sobbed", 0.015384615384615385], ["startled", 0.015384615384615385], ["thought", 0.015384615384615385], ["turn", 0.015384615384615385], ["sententious", 0.015384615384615385], ["temperature", 0.015384615384615385], ["threat", 0.015384615384615385], ["bells", 0.015384615384615385], ["anita", 0.015384615384615385]], "sentiment": ["\u201cIs wearing another man\u2019s shirt adultery in your book?\u201d Underneath, she was plainly rattled.\nPaul was delighted.
