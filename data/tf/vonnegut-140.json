His laugh was a chilling laugh about how little Nature ever cares about what human beings think is going on.\nAnd Whistler kept his pickets before the State House for ten more days, until the night of the execution. Then he led them through the winding streets and across the bridge to Charlestown, where the prison was. Among his pickets were Edna St. Vincent Millay and John Dos Passos and Heywood Broun.\nNational Guardsmen and police were waiting for them. There were machine gunners on the walls, with their guns aimed out at the general populace, the people who wanted Pontius Pilate to be merciful.\nAnd Kenneth Whistler had with him a heavy parcel. It was an enormous banner, long and narrow and rolled up tight. He had had it made that morning.\nThe prison lights began their dimming.\nWhen they had dimmed nine times, Whistler and a friend hurried to the funeral parlor where the bodies of Sacco and Vanzetti were to be displayed. The state had no further use for the bodies. They had become the property of relatives and friends again.\nWhistler told us that two pairs of sawhorses had been set up in the front room of the funeral parlor, awaiting the coffins. Now Whistler and his friend unfurled their banner, and they nailed it to the wall over the sawhorses.\nOn the banner were painted the words that the man who had sentenced Sacco and Vanzetti to death, Webster Thayer, had spoken to a friend soon after he passed the sentence:\ndid you see what i did to those\nanarchist bastards the other day?", -0.027566964285714285], "title": "Jailbird"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["martian", 0.043859649122807015], ["rumfoord", 0.043859649122807015], ["ships", 0.03508771929824561], ["moncrief", 0.02631578947368421], ["earthling", 0.02631578947368421], ["suicide", 0.017543859649122806], ["half", 0.017543859649122806], ["day", 0.017543859649122806], ["mars", 0.017543859649122806], ["man", 0.017543859649122806], ["investments", 0.017543859649122806], ["code", 0.008771929824561403], ["managed", 0.008771929824561403], ["money", 0.008771929824561403], ["rifles", 0.008771929824561403], ["earth", 0.008771929824561403], ["children", 0.008771929824561403], ["26", 0.008771929824561403], ["program", 0.008771929824561403], ["easy", 0.008771929824561403], ["treasury", 0.008771929824561403], ["prime", 0.008771929824561403], ["gains", 0.008771929824561403], ["wave", 0.008771929824561403], ["earl", 0.008771929824561403], ["identified", 0.008771929824561403], ["52", 0.008771929824561403], ["securities", 0.008771929824561403], ["fired", 0.008771929824561403], ["people", 0.008771929824561403], ["servile", 0.008771929824561403], ["391", 0.008771929824561403], ["broadway", 0.008771929824561403], ["close", 0.008771929824561403], ["86", 0.008771929824561403], ["ruthless", 0.008771929824561403], ["weapons", 0.008771929824561403], ["capital", 0.008771929824561403], ["912", 0.008771929824561403], ["martians", 0.008771929824561403], ["men", 0.008771929824561403], ["civilians", 0.008771929824561403], ["training", 0.008771929824561403], ["brilliant", 0.008771929824561403], ["elaborate", 0.008771929824561403], ["irregulars", 0.008771929824561403], ["headed", 0.008771929824561403], ["coming", 0.008771929824561403], ["accounts", 0.008771929824561403], ["trained", 0.008771929824561403], ["armed", 0.008771929824561403], ["ancient", 0.008771929824561403], ["troops", 0.008771929824561403], ["service", 0.008771929824561403], ["army", 0.008771929824561403], ["opportunity", 0.008771929824561403], ["financed", 0.008771929824561403], ["three", 0.008771929824561403], ["secret", 0.008771929824561403], ["butler", 0.008771929824561403], ["738", 0.008771929824561403], ["wretched", 0.008771929824561403], ["niles", 0.008771929824561403], ["inventions", 0.008771929824561403], ["minister", 0.008771929824561403], ["women", 0.008771929824561403], ["future", 0.008771929824561403], ["721", 0.008771929824561403], ["male", 0.008771929824561403], ["uniforms", 0.008771929824561403], ["remained", 0.008771929824561403], ["unchanged", 0.008771929824561403], ["winston", 0.008771929824561403], ["pie", 0.008771929824561403], ["unarmed", 0.008771929824561403], ["reserves", 0.008771929824561403], ["numbers", 0.008771929824561403], ["facade", 0.008771929824561403], ["orders", 0.008771929824561403], ["affairs", 0.008771929824561403], ["46", 0.008771929824561403], ["119", 0.008771929824561403], ["swiss", 0.008771929824561403], ["waves", 0.008771929824561403], ["mastermind", 0.008771929824561403], ["grow", 0.008771929824561403], ["land", 0.008771929824561403], ["effective", 0.008771929824561403], ["life", 0.008771929824561403], ["procurement", 0.008771929824561403], ["directly", 0.008771929824561403], ["banks", 0.008771929824561403], ["left", 0.008771929824561403]], "sentiment": ["The last of the Martians were coming in three waves.\nIn the first wave came the army reserves, the last of the trained troops\u201426,119 men in 721 ships.\nA half an Earthling day behind them came 86,912 recently-armed male civilians in 1,738 ships.

Again, as he had felt when Kroner took his hand at the Country Club, Paul felt his strength and will dwarfed by the old man. \u201cPaul, I want you to tell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d\nThe hands on his knees tightened. Paul struggled resentfully against the urge to pour his heart out to this merciful, wise, gentle father. But his sullenness decayed. Paul began to talk.\nHis formless misgivings and disquiet of a week before, he realized, had shape now. The raw material of his discontent was now cast in another man\u2019s molds. He was saying what Lasher had said the night before, talking about the spiritual disaster across the river, about the threat of revolution, about the hierarchy that was a nightmare to most. The way he phrased it, it wasn\u2019t a condemnation, it was a plea for refutation.\nKroner, his hands still on Paul\u2019s knees, hung his head lower and lower.\nPaul came to the end, and Kroner stood and turned his back to stare out of the window. The spell was still in force, and Paul looked expectantly at the broad back, waiting for wisdom.\nKroner turned suddenly. \u201cSo you\u2019re against us.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say that, certainly. They\u2019re questions that deserve some sort of answer.\u201d\n\u201cKeep to your own side of the river, Paul! Your job is management and engineering. I don\u2019t know what the answers are to Lasher\u2019s questions. I do know that it\u2019s far easier to ask questions than to answer them. I know that there have always been questions, and men like Lasher ready to make trouble by asking them.\u201d\n\u201cYou know about Lasher?\u201d Paul hadn\u2019t mentioned his name.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve known about him for quite some time. And, as of this noon, I know what you and Lasher and Finnerty were up to last night.\u201d He looked sad. \u201cAs district industrial security officer, there isn\u2019t much I don\u2019t know, Paul.

at the cemetery in Malm\u00f6, when Swedish clay was thumping wetly on the lid of my coffin and Hjalmar Arvid Bostr\u00f6m, who certainly was never going to write Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony, said of me, \u201cOh, well\u2014he wasn\u2019t going to write Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony anyway.\u201d Its third appearance was when I myself was up in the crow\u2019s nest\u2014during a storm in the North Atlantic, in the sleet and spray, holding my severed head on high as though it were a basketball.\nThe question the blue tunnel implies by appearing is one only I can answer: Have I at last exhausted my curiosity as to what life is all about? If so, I need only step inside what I liken to a vacuum cleaner. If there is indeed suction within the blue tunnel, which is filled with a light much like that cast off by the electric stoves and ovens of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, it does not seem to trouble my late father, the science fiction writer Kilgore Trout, who can stand right in the nozzle and chat with me.\nThe first thing Father said to me from above the stern of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was this: \u201cHad enough of the ship of fools, my boy? You come to Papa right now. Turn me down this time, and you won\u2019t see me again for a million years.\u201d\nA million years! My God\u2014a million years! He wasn\u2019t fooling. As bad a father as he had been, he had always kept his promises, and he had never knowingly lied to me.\nSo I took one step in his direction, but not a second one. I was like a female blue-footed booby at the start of a courtship dance. As in a courtship dance, that uncertain first step was the first tick of a clock, which would become irresistible. Already I was changed, although I was still a long way from the nozzle. The throbbing of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin\u2019s engines became fainter and the steel sun deck became transparent, so that I could see into the main saloon below, where the Kanka-bono girls were gnawing the bones of their innocent sister Kazakh.\nThat first step toward my father made me think this about the Indian girls and Mary up in the crow\u2019s nest to my back, and Hisako Hiroguchi and her fetus in the lavatory and the demoralized Captain and the blind Selena on the bridge, and the corpse in the walk-in freezer: \u201cWhy should I ever have cared about these strangers, these slaves of fear and hunger? What do they have to do with me?\u201d\nWhen I failed to take a second step in his direction, my father said, \u201cKeep moving, Leon. No time to be coy.\u201d\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t completed my research,\u201d I protested. I had chosen to be a ghost because the job carried with it, as a fringe benefit, license to read minds, to learn the truth of people\u2019s pasts, to see through walls, to be many places all at once, to learn in depth how this or that situation had come to be structured as it was, and to have access to all human knowledge. \u201cFather\u2014\u201d I said, \u201cgive me five more years.\u201d\n\u201cFive years!\u201d he exclaimed. He mocked me with the three previous bargains I had made with him: \u201c\u2018Just one more day, Dad.\u2019 \u2018Just one more month, Daddy.\u2019 \u2018Just six more months, Pop.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m learning so much about what life is really like, how it really works, what it\u2019s really all about!\u201d I said.", 0.08139837819185647], "title": "Galapagos"}, "god-bless-you-mr-rosewater": {"tfidf": [["language", 0.043478260869565216], ["expedition", 0.028985507246376812], ["eliot", 0.028985507246376812], ["boyle", 0.021739130434782608], ["mental", 0.021739130434782608], ["telepathy", 0.021739130434782608], ["bus", 0.021739130434782608], ["earthling", 0.021739130434782608], ["group", 0.014492753623188406], ["good", 0.014492753623188406], ["universe", 0.014492753623188406], ["thing", 0.014492753623188406], ["place", 0.014492753623188406], ["church", 0.014492753623188406], ["sergeant", 0.014492753623188406], ["sort", 0.014492753623188406], ["serving", 0.007246376811594203], ["cried", 0.007246376811594203], ["lewis", 0.007246376811594203], ["supported", 0.007246376811594203], ["produced", 0.007246376811594203], ["earth", 0.007246376811594203], ["slow", 0.007246376811594203], ["thinking", 0.007246376811594203], ["signals", 0.007246376811594203], ["going", 0.007246376811594203], ["black", 0.007246376811594203], ["pretty", 0.007246376811594203], ["indifference", 0.007246376811594203], ["government", 0.007246376811594203], ["read", 0.007246376811594203], ["rosewater", 0.007246376811594203], ["joint", 0.007246376811594203], ["telling", 0.007246376811594203], ["earthlings", 0.007246376811594203], ["unique", 0.007246376811594203], ["day", 0.007246376811594203], ["projects", 0.007246376811594203], ["creature", 0.007246376811594203], ["husband", 0.007246376811594203], ["luck", 0.007246376811594203], ["faintest", 0.007246376811594203], ["wasn", 0.007246376811594203], ["fussing", 0.007246376811594203], ["uncomfortable", 0.007246376811594203], ["pass", 0.007246376811594203], ["jobs", 0.007246376811594203], ["creatures", 0.007246376811594203], ["velvet", 0.007246376811594203], ["space", 0.007246376811594203], ["god", 0.007246376811594203], ["hopefully", 0.007246376811594203], ["terms", 0.007246376811594203], ["notice", 0.007246376811594203], ["hero", 0.007246376811594203], ["galaxies", 0.007246376811594203], ["reason", 0.007246376811594203], ["surely", 0.007246376811594203], ["members", 0.007246376811594203], ["active", 0.007246376811594203], ["exciting", 0.007246376811594203], ["teacher", 0.007246376811594203], ["suggested", 0.007246376811594203], ["milky", 0.007246376811594203], ["narrow", 0.007246376811594203], ["book", 0.007246376811594203], ["clark", 0.007246376811594203], ["appeared", 0.007246376811594203], ["three", 0.007246376811594203], ["reached", 0.007246376811594203], ["story", 0.007246376811594203], ["wanted", 0.007246376811594203], ["constantly", 0.007246376811594203], ["system", 0.007246376811594203], ["start", 0.007246376811594203], ["meanings", 0.007246376811594203], ["final", 0.007246376811594203], ["friend", 0.007246376811594203], ["solar", 0.007246376811594203], ["technician", 0.007246376811594203], ["effort", 0.007246376811594203], ["join", 0.007246376811594203], ["sobbed", 0.007246376811594203], ["teachers", 0.007246376811594203], ["slightest", 0.007246376811594203], ["enchanted", 0.007246376811594203], ["rim", 0.007246376811594203], ["sense", 0.007246376811594203], ["absolute", 0.007246376811594203], ["began", 0.007246376811594203], ["equipment", 0.007246376811594203], ["setting", 0.007246376811594203], ["generalized", 0.007246376811594203], ["pan", 0.007246376811594203], ["nice", 0.007246376811594203], ["waved", 0.007246376811594203], ["galactic", 0.007246376811594203], ["raymond", 0.007246376811594203], ["time", 0.007246376811594203], ["sagged", 0.007246376811594203], ["coming", 0.007246376811594203], ["friends", 0.007246376811594203], ["man", 0.007246376811594203], ["age", 0.007246376811594203], ["goodbye", 0.007246376811594203], ["english", 0.007246376811594203], ["claims", 0.007246376811594203], ["pulled", 0.007246376811594203], ["fact", 0.007246376811594203]], "sentiment": ["\"Oh, Mr. Rosewater\u2014\" she sobbed, and she sagged against the bus, \"you're my only friend.\"\n\"You can make more, surely,\" Eliot suggested hopefully.\n\"Oh God!\" she cried.\n\"You could join some church group, perhaps.\"\n\"You're my church group! You're my everything! You're my government. You're my husband. You're my friends.\"\nThese claims made Eliot uncomfortable. \"You're very nice to say so. Good luck to you. I really have to be going now.\" He waved. \"Goodbye.\"\nEliot now began to read Pan-Galactic Three-Day Pass. There was more fussing outside the bus, but Eliot didn't think it had anything to do with him. He was immediately enchanted by the book, so much so that he didn't even notice when the bus pulled away. It was an exciting story, all about a man who was serving on a sort of Space-Age Lewis and Clark Expedition. The hero's name was Sergeant Raymond Boyle.\nThe expedition had reached what appeared to be the absolute and final rim of the Universe. There didn't seem to be anything beyond the solar system they were in, and they were setting up equipment to sense the faintest signals that might be coming from the slightest anything in all that black velvet nothing out there.\nSergeant Boyle was an Earthling. He was the only Earthling on the expedition. In fact, he was the only creature from the Milky Way. The other members were from all over the place. The expedition was a joint effort supported by about two hundred galaxies. Boyle wasn't a technician. He was an English teacher. The thing was that Earth was the only place in the whole known Universe where language was used. It was a unique Earthling invention. Everybody else used mental telepathy, so Earthlings could get pretty good jobs as language teachers just about anywhere they went.\nThe reason creatures wanted to use language instead of mental telepathy was that they found out they could get so much more done with language. Language made them so much more active. Mental telepathy, with everybody constantly telling everybody everything, produced a sort of generalized indifference to all information.

planets, who are supposed to be so smart? A lot of people believe that they have already been here, and that they taught us how to build pyramids. One thing that even the Egyptians can agree on, I think, is that we don\u2019t need any more pyramids.\n\u201cAs an ordinary person, appalled as I am by the speed with which we are wrecking our topsoil, our drinking water, and our atmosphere, I will suggest an idea about good and evil which might fit into a modern and simple moral code. Evil disgusts us. Good fills us with joy and brings a sparkle to our eyes. That much remains the same. Might we not go farther, though, and say that anything which wounds the planet is evil, and anything which preserves it or heals it is good?\n\u201cLet me be the first to say that the idea is sappy, whatever that means. I think sappiness has something to do with being concerned about grandchildren, and the hell with them. But the worst thing about my moral code is that it invites people to have the fun of being glamorously wicked at first, which many of us feel is sexy, and then becoming almost swooningly virtuous at the end. This comes close to being the biography of Saint Augustine, and of several other famous holy men.\n\u201cOn a larger scale, entire nations love to blow the hell out of other nations, and then to come like angels to pass out glass eyes and artificial limbs and Hershey bars and all that, to rebuild everything, to get everything going again.\n\u201cWe would have to understand from the first the scientific fact that any wound we inflict on the life-support systems of this planet is likely to be quite permanent. So anyone who wounded the planet, and then pretended to heal it, would simply be another hypocrite. He would remain quite permanently an evil and therefore disgusting human being.\n\u201cI went to a Unitarian church for a while, and it might show. The minister said one Easter Sunday that, if we listened closely to the bell on his church, we would hear that it was singing, over and over again, \u2019No hell, no hell, no hell.\u2019 No matter what we did in life, he said, we wouldn\u2019t burn throughout eternity in hell. We wouldn\u2019t even fry for ten or fifteen minutes. He was just guessing, of course.\n\u201cJimmy Breslin, on the other hand, told me one time that he sort of hankered to get back into Catholicism, because he thought there were a lot of people in the Nixon administration who deserved to roast in hell. May be so.\n\u201cAt any rate, I don\u2019t think anybody ever dreaded hell as much as most of us dread the contempt of our fellowmen. Under our new and heartfelt moral code, we might be able to horrify would-be evildoers with just that: the contempt of their fellowmen.\n\u201cFor that contempt to be effective, though, we would need cohesive communities, which are about as common as bald eagles these days. And it is curious that such communities should be so rare, since human beings are genetically such gregarious creatures. They need plenty of like-minded friends and relatives almost as much as they need B-complex vitamins and a heartfelt moral code.\n\u201cI know Sargent Shriver slightly. When he was campaigning for vice-president, he asked me if I had any ideas. You remember that there was plenty of money around, but as far as ideas went, both parties were in a state of destitution. So I told him, and I am afraid he didn\u2019t listen, that the number one American killer wasn\u2019t cardiovascular disease, but loneliness. I told him that he and McGovern could swamp the Republicans if they would promise to cure that disease. I even gave him a slogan to put on buttons and bumpers and flags and billboards: Lonesome No More!", 0.009864804507661641], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["000", 0.04316546762589928], ["muriel", 0.02877697841726619], ["people", 0.02877697841726619], ["asked", 0.02158273381294964], ["toilet", 0.02158273381294964], ["clarke", 0.02158273381294964], ["man", 0.02158273381294964], ["black", 0.014388489208633094], ["jack", 0.014388489208633094], ["arthur", 0.014388489208633094], ["water", 0.014388489208633094], ["york", 0.014388489208633094], ["book", 0.014388489208633094], ["thought", 0.014388489208633094], ["painting", 0.014388489208633094], ["replied", 0.007194244604316547], ["walking", 0.007194244604316547], ["money", 0.007194244604316547], ["rest", 0.007194244604316547], ["hell", 0.007194244604316547], ["toilets", 0.007194244604316547], ["retirement", 0.007194244604316547], ["guts", 0.007194244604316547], ["father", 0.007194244604316547], ["innocent", 0.007194244604316547], ["inherited", 0.007194244604316547], ["activities", 0.007194244604316547], ["woman", 0.007194244604316547], ["read", 0.007194244604316547], ["couple", 0.007194244604316547], ["famous", 0.007194244604316547], ["remedy", 0.007194244604316547], ["roisterers", 0.007194244604316547], ["cape", 0.007194244604316547], ["sinus", 0.007194244604316547], ["apart", 0.007194244604316547], ["bar", 0.007194244604316547], ["kennedy", 0.007194244604316547], ["57", 0.007194244604316547], ["52", 0.007194244604316547], ["stopped", 0.007194244604316547], ["popular", 0.007194244604316547], ["year", 0.007194244604316547], ["collector", 0.007194244604316547], ["provided", 0.007194244604316547], ["reviewer", 0.007194244604316547], ["record", 0.007194244604316547], ["review", 0.007194244604316547], ["axes", 0.007194244604316547], ["state", 0.007194244604316547], ["won", 0.007194244604316547], ["stories", 0.007194244604316547], ["patton", 0.007194244604316547], ["told", 0.007194244604316547], ["sold", 0.007194244604316547], ["murdered", 0.007194244604316547], ["baseball", 0.007194244604316547], ["merry", 0.007194244604316547], ["eye", 0.007194244604316547], ["couldn", 0.007194244604316547], ["invited", 0.007194244604316547], ["museum", 0.007194244604316547], ["florida", 0.007194244604316547], ["reason", 0.007194244604316547], ["recognized", 0.007194244604316547], ["times", 0.007194244604316547], ["players", 0.007194244604316547], ["american", 0.007194244604316547], ["california", 0.007194244604316547], ["whimsical", 0.007194244604316547], ["hartke", 0.007194244604316547], ["major", 0.007194244604316547], ["retired", 0.007194244604316547], ["community", 0.007194244604316547], ["cocoa", 0.007194244604316547], ["laugh", 0.007194244604316547], ["parties", 0.007194244604316547], ["rave", 0.007194244604316547], ["lottery", 0.007194244604316547], ["caught", 0.007194244604316547], ["three", 0.007194244604316547], ["mark", 0.007194244604316547], ["passed", 0.007194244604316547], ["white", 0.007194244604316547], ["headache", 0.007194244604316547], ["malibu", 0.007194244604316547], ["getty", 0.007194244604316547], ["gore", 0.007194244604316547], ["ashamed", 0.007194244604316547], ["inside", 0.007194244604316547], ["corpses", 0.007194244604316547], ["movies", 0.007194244604316547], ["knives", 0.007194244604316547], ["37", 0.007194244604316547], ["confessed", 0.007194244604316547], ["autobiography", 0.007194244604316547], ["author", 0.007194244604316547], ["answering", 0.007194244604316547], ["diarrhea", 0.007194244604316547], ["astronaut", 0.007194244604316547], ["rothko", 0.007194244604316547], ["beach", 0.007194244604316547], ["horror", 0.007194244604316547], ["drink", 0.007194244604316547], ["user", 0.007194244604316547], ["remember", 0.007194244604316547], ["daily", 0.007194244604316547], ["dared", 0.007194244604316547], ["vietnam", 0.007194244604316547], ["time", 0.007194244604316547], ["commercials", 0.007194244604316547], ["fact", 0.007194244604316547]], "sentiment": ["Several of the merry roisterers had come inside to use the toilet or get a drink of water. Arthur K. Clarke had provided everything but water and toilets. So Muriel had dared to ask some of them who they were and what they did.\nThree of the people were Black. One Black was an old woman who had just won $57,000,000 in the New York State Lottery, and the other 2 were baseball players who made $3,000,000 a year.\nA white man, who kept apart from the rest, and, according to Muriel, didn\u2019t seem to know what to make of himself, was a daily book reviewer for The New York Times. He had given a rave review to Clarke\u2019s autobiography, Don\u2019t Be Ashamed of Money.\nOne man who came in to use the toilet, she said, was a famous author of horror stories that had been made into some of the most popular movies of all time. I had in fact read a couple of them in Vietnam, about innocent people getting murdered by walking corpses with axes and knives and so on.\nI passed 1 of them on to Jack Patton, I remember, and asked him later what he thought of it. And then I stopped him from answering, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me, Jack. I already know.

There was no legal machinery for that.\nThe United States Government did promise, however, to make a full and open review of my puzzling case, to find out exactly what my citizenship status was, to find out why I had never even been brought to trial.\nThat Government expressed queasy surprise that I was even within its borders.\nThe New York Times published a portrait of me as a much younger man, my official portrait as a Nazi and idol of the international airwaves. I can only guess at the year in which the picture was taken\u20141941, I think.\nArndt Klopfer, the photographer who took the picture of me, did his best to make me look like a Maxfield Parrish Jesus covered with cold cream. He even gave me a halo, a judiciously placed spot of nebulous light in the background. The halo was no special effect for me alone. Everybody who went to Klopfer got a halo, including Adolf Eichmann.\nI can say that for certain about Eichmann, without asking for confirmation from the Haifa Institute, because Eichmann had his picture taken just ahead of me at Klopfer\u2019s studio. It was the only time I ever met Eichmann\u2014the only time in Germany. I met him again here in Israel\u2014only two weeks ago, when I was incarcerated briefly in Tel Aviv.\nAbout that reunion: I was locked up in Tel Aviv for twenty-four hours. On my way to my cell there, the guards stopped me outside Eichmann\u2019s cell to hear what we had to say to each other, if anything.\nWe didn\u2019t recognize each other, and the guards had to introduce us.\nEichmann was writing the story of his life, just as I am now writing the story of my life.

Would you please tell Max gravely that you think I should stay with Cape, too?\nI sent you the dictionary piece yesterday. That makes us square. Right? The trip has simplified the war book for me.

He moved because of absentminded politeness, taking a Trout book with him\u2014the one about Jesus and the time machine.\nThe time-traveler in the book went back to Bible times to find out one thing in particular: Whether or not Jesus had really died on the cross, or whether he had been taken down while still alive, whether he had really gone on living. The hero had a stethoscope along.\nBilly skipped to the end of the book, where the hero mingled with the people who were taking Jesus down from the cross. The time-traveler was the first one up the ladder, dressed in clothes of the period, and he leaned close to Jesus so people couldn\u2019t see him use the stethoscope, and he listened.\nThere wasn\u2019t a sound inside the emaciated chest cavity. The Son of God was dead as a doornail.\nSo it goes.\nThe time-traveler, whose name was Lance Corwin, also got to measure the length of Jesus, but not to weigh him. Jesus was five feet and three and a half inches long.\nAnother clerk came up to Billy and asked him if he was going to buy the book or not, and Billy said that he wanted to buy it, please. He had his back to a rack of paperback books about oral-genital contacts from ancient Egypt to the present and so on, and the clerk supposed Billy was reading one of these. So he was startled when he saw what Billy\u2019s book was. He said, \u201cJesus Christ, where did you find this thing?\u201d and so on, and he had to tell the other clerks about the pervert who wanted to buy the window dressing. The other clerks already knew about Billy. They had been watching him, too.\nThe cash register where Billy waited for his change was near a bin of old girly magazines. Billy looked at one out of the corner of his eye, and he saw this question on its cover. What really became of Montana Wildhack?\nSo Billy read it. He knew where Montana Wildhack really was, of course.
