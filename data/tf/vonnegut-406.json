This old geezer looks at that unearthly beauty and damn near swoons.\nI love you, too, and am so relieved that you are getting rid of one more damn house to worry about. I wish I could do the same with our poor old sick and empty relic in the Hamptons, but, alas, my co-owner, who doesn\u2019t like it, says it \u201cisn\u2019t her taste,\u201d will not let that happen.\nAs you may know, I took a bad spill while crossing a blacked-out parking lot in Northampton November 22nd, messed up my left side and strained my ribcage, and so am compelled at last to admit how awfully old I am. So now I stay in my room here, and, like other old folks, watch TV and pretty much hibernate.\nK\nDecember 14, 1999\nNew York City\nTO NANNY VONNEGUT", -0.010827922077922072], "title": "Letters"}}
