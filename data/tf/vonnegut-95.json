Booth Tarkington spotted him, got him onto Broadway. His cousins and siblings looked upon him as a frightful failure, because he died of booze in his early fifties. But he\u2019d had a lot of wonderful parts and brilliant friends, far, far from Indianapolis. Essentially, what he\u2019d done was use himself up, which is what people are supposed to do.

mushrooms or umbrellas full of holes, but really quite interesting. Like my ballroom dancing, they were acceptable. He has since sent me multicolored originals, which I like a lot.\nThe message he sent me along with the Xeroxes, though, wasn\u2019t about unexpected happiness. It was an unreconstructed technocrat\u2019s challenge to the artsy-fartsy, of which I was a prime exemplar. \u201cIs this art or not?\u201d he asked. He couldn\u2019t have put that question so jeeringly fifty years ago, of course, before the founding of the first wholly American school of painting, Abstract Expressionism, and the deification in particular of Jack the Dripper, Jackson Pollock, who also couldn\u2019t draw for sour apples.\nBernie said, too, that a very interesting scientific phenomenon was involved, having to do, he left me to guess, with how different glurps behave when squoozled this way and that, with nowhere to go but up or down or sideways. If the artsy-fartsy world had no use for his pictures, he seemed to imply, his pictures could still point the way to better lubricants or suntan lotions, or who knows what? The all-new Preparation H!\nHe would not sign his pictures, he said, or admit publicly that he had made them, or describe how they were made. He plainly expected puffed-up critics to sweat bullets and excrete sizable chunks of masonry when trying to answer his cunningly innocent question: \u201cArt or not?\u201d\nI was pleased to reply with an epistle which was frankly vengeful, since he and Father had screwed me out of a liberal arts college education: \u201cDear Brother: This is almost like telling you about the birds and the bees,\u201d I began. \u201cThere are many good people who are beneficially stimulated by some, but not all, manmade arrangements of colors and shapes on flat surfaces, essentially nonsense.\n\u201cYou yourself are gratified by some music, arrangements of noises, and again essentially nonsense. If I were to kick a bucket down the cellar stairs, and then say to you that the racket I had made was philosophically on a par with The Magic Flute, this would not be the beginning of a long and upsetting debate. An utterly satisfactory and complete response on your part would be, \u2018I like what Mozart did, and I hate what the bucket did.\u2019\n\u201cContemplating a purported work of art is a social activity. Either you have a rewarding time, or you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to say why afterward. You don\u2019t have to say anything.\n\u201cYou are a justly revered experimentalist, dear Brother. If you really want to know whether your pictures are, as you say, \u2018art or not,\u2019 you must display them in a public place somewhere, and see if strangers like to look at them. That is the way the game is played. Let me know what happens.\u201d\nI went on: \u201cPeople capable of liking some paintings or prints or whatever can rarely do so without knowing something about the artist. Again, the situation is social rather than scientific. Any work of art is half of a conversation between two human beings, and it helps a lot to know who is talking at you. Does he or she have a reputation for seriousness, for religiosity, for suffering, for concupiscence, for rebellion, for sincerity, for jokes?\n\u201cThere are virtually no respected paintings made by persons about whom we know zilch.

Harris. I hadn\u2019t bothered Firehouse with it or with myself.\nIn a week or so, there would be a juicy melon from one of his steel companies. Three of his oil stocks were paying extra dividends. The farm machinery company in which he owned five thousand shares was about to offer him rights worth three dollars apiece.\nThanks to me and my company and an economy in full bloom, Herbert was about to be several thousand dollars richer than he\u2019d been a month before. I had a right to be proud, but my triumph\u2014except for the commission\u2014was gall and wormwood.\nNobody could do anything for Herbert. Herbert already had what he wanted. He had had it long before the inheritance or I intruded. He had the respectability his mother had hammered into him. But just as priceless as that was an income not quite big enough to go around. It left him no alternative but\u2014 in the holy names of wife, child, and home\u2014to play piano in a dive, and breathe smoke, and drink gin, to be Firehouse Harris, his father\u2019s son, three nights out of seven.\n(1951)\nMISS TEMPTATION\nPURITANISM had fallen into such disrepair that not even the oldest spinster thought of putting Susanna in a ducking stool; not even the oldest farmer suspected that Susanna\u2019s diabolical beauty had made his cow run dry.\nSusanna was a bit-part actress in the summer theater near the village, and she rented a room over the firehouse. She was a part of village life all summer, but the villagers never got used to her. She was forever as startling and desirable as a piece of big-city fire apparatus.\nSusanna\u2019s feathery hair and saucer eyes were as black as midnight. Her skin was the color of cream. Her hips were like a lyre, and her bosom made men dream of peace and plenty for ever and ever. She wore barbaric golden hoops on her shell-pink ears, and around her ankles were chains with little bells on them.\nShe went barefoot and slept until noon every day. And, as noon drew near, the villagers on the main street would grow as restless as beagles with a thunderstorm on the way.", 0.09557453416149066], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["dick", 0.02564102564102564], ["deadeye", 0.02564102564102564], ["night", 0.02564102564102564], ["schramm", 0.02564102564102564], ["hadn", 0.017094017094017096], ["young", 0.017094017094017096], ["woman", 0.017094017094017096], ["job", 0.017094017094017096], ["wanted", 0.017094017094017096], ["drunk", 0.017094017094017096], ["perfumes", 0.017094017094017096], ["chocolate", 0.017094017094017096], ["telephone", 0.017094017094017096], ["watches", 0.017094017094017096], ["person", 0.017094017094017096], ["shot", 0.008547008547008548], ["years", 0.008547008547008548], ["produced", 0.008547008547008548], ["course", 0.008547008547008548], ["aspect", 0.008547008547008548], ["stores", 0.008547008547008548], ["windshield", 0.008547008547008548], ["milk", 0.008547008547008548], ["pharmacy", 0.008547008547008548], ["presents", 0.008547008547008548], ["shout", 0.008547008547008548], ["crowds", 0.008547008547008548], ["anticipated", 0.008547008547008548], ["early", 0.008547008547008548], ["people", 0.008547008547008548], ["sign", 0.008547008547008548], ["unsettling", 0.008547008547008548], ["ice", 0.008547008547008548], ["malted", 0.008547008547008548], ["witty", 0.008547008547008548], ["fountain", 0.008547008547008548], ["closed", 0.008547008547008548], ["sorts", 0.008547008547008548], ["reading", 0.008547008547008548], ["eating", 0.008547008547008548], ["business", 0.008547008547008548], ["remembered", 0.008547008547008548], ["sold", 0.008547008547008548], ["met", 0.008547008547008548], ["complicated", 0.008547008547008548], ["york", 0.008547008547008548], ["prescription", 0.008547008547008548], ["distinguished", 0.008547008547008548], ["thing", 0.008547008547008548], ["milkshake", 0.008547008547008548], ["soda", 0.008547008547008548], ["passing", 0.008547008547008548], ["birthdays", 0.008547008547008548], ["family", 0.008547008547008548], ["number", 0.008547008547008548], ["respectable", 0.008547008547008548], ["magazines", 0.008547008547008548], ["wasn", 0.008547008547008548], ["rarely", 0.008547008547008548], ["expensive", 0.008547008547008548], ["city", 0.008547008547008548], ["long", 0.008547008547008548], ["doubt", 0.008547008547008548], ["wonderfully", 0.008547008547008548], ["passed", 0.008547008547008548], ["call", 0.008547008547008548], ["ph", 0.008547008547008548], ["syrup", 0.008547008547008548], ["store", 0.008547008547008548], ["town", 0.008547008547008548], ["places", 0.008547008547008548], ["car", 0.008547008547008548], ["anniversaries", 0.008547008547008548], ["will", 0.008547008547008548], ["movies", 0.008547008547008548], ["mature", 0.008547008547008548], ["surprisingly", 0.008547008547008548], ["feeling", 0.008547008547008548], ["called", 0.008547008547008548], ["history", 0.008547008547008548], ["squinted", 0.008547008547008548], ["waltz", 0.008547008547008548], ["evidently", 0.008547008547008548], ["cream", 0.008547008547008548], ["daring", 0.008547008547008548], ["cigarettes", 0.008547008547008548], ["rudolph", 0.008547008547008548], ["play", 0.008547008547008548], ["knew", 0.008547008547008548], ["fell", 0.008547008547008548], ["plenty", 0.008547008547008548], ["nickname", 0.008547008547008548], ["racks", 0.008547008547008548], ["remember", 0.008547008547008548], ["counter", 0.008547008547008548], ["face", 0.008547008547008548], ["drunks", 0.008547008547008548], ["time", 0.008547008547008548]], "sentiment": ["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nVery early on at Schramm\u2019s, long before I ran off to New York City to see my play produced, a drunk came in at about two A.M., maybe, and he squinted at the sign on the prescription counter which said, RUDOLPH WALTZ, R.PH.\nHe evidently knew something of our family\u2019s distinguished history, although I don\u2019t think we had ever met before. And he was drunk enough to say to me, \u201cAre you the one who shot the woman, or are you the one who put the woman through the windshield?\u201d\nHe wanted a chocolate malted milkshake, I remember. Schramm\u2019s hadn\u2019t had a soda fountain for at least five years. He wanted one anyway. \u201cYou just give me a little milk and ice cream and chocolate syrup, and I\u2019ll make it myself,\u201d he said. And then he fell down.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHe didn\u2019t call me \u201cDeadeye Dick.\u201d Very rarely did anybody do that to my face. But my nickname was said often enough behind my back in all sorts of crowds\u2014in stores, at movies, in eating places. Or maybe somebody would shout it at me from a passing car. It was a thing for drunks or young people to do. No mature and respectable person ever called me \u201cDeadeye Dick.\u201d\nBut one unsettling aspect of the all-night job at Schramm\u2019s, one I hadn\u2019t anticipated, was the telephone there. Hardly a night passed that some young person, feeling wonderfully daring and witty, no doubt, would telephone to ask me if I was Deadeye Dick.\nI always was. I always will be.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere was plenty of time for reading on the job, and there were any number of magazines on the racks.

She was a nonstop talker, which made her hard to know, and her theme was always the same: successful people who saw opportunities and grasped them firmly, people who, unlike her husband, were important and rich.\n\u201cYoung Kurt Ehrens\u2014\u201d she would say, \u201conly twenty-six, and a full colonel in the S.S.! And his brother Heinrich\u2014he can\u2019t be more than thirty-four, but he has eighteen thousand foreign workers under him, all building tank traps. Heinrich knows more about tank traps than any man alive, they say, and I used to dance with him.\u201d\nOn and on she would talk this way, with poor Heinz in the background, smoking his brains out. And one thing she did to me was made me deaf to all success stories. The people she saw as succeeding in a brave new world were, after all, being rewarded as specialists in slavery, destruction, and death. I don\u2019t consider people who work in those fields successful.\nAs the war drew to a close, Heinz and I couldn\u2019t drink in our pillbox any more. An eighty-eight was set up in it, and the gun was manned by boys about fifteen or sixteen years old. There was a success story for Heinz\u2019s late wife\u2014boys that young, and yet with men\u2019s uniforms and a fully-armed death trap all their own.\nSo Heinz and I did our drinking and talking in our dormitory, a riding hall jammed with bombed-out government workers sleeping on straw mattresses.

His hot bed smelled like a mushroom cellar. He had had a wet dream about Montana Wildhack.\nOn the morning after that wet dream, Billy decided to go back to work in his office in the shopping plaza. Business was booming as usual. His assistants were keeping up with it nicely. They were startled to see him. They had been told by his daughter that he might never practice again.\nBut Billy went into his examining room briskly, asked that the first patient be sent in. So they sent him one\u2014a twelve-year-old boy who was accompanied by his widowed mother. They were strangers, new in town. Billy asked them a little about themselves, learned that the boy\u2019s father had been killed in Vietnam\u2014in the famous five-day battle for Hill 875 near Dakto. So it goes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhile he examined the boy\u2019s eyes, Billy told him matter-of-factly about his adventures on Tralfamadore, assured the fatherless boy that his father was very much alive still in moments the boy would see again and again.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that comforting?\u201d Billy asked.\nAnd somewhere in there, the boy\u2019s mother went out and told the receptionist that Billy was evidently going crazy. Billy was taken home. His daughter asked him again, \u201cFather, Father, Father\u2014what are we going to do with you?\u201d\n6\nLISTEN:\nBilly Pilgrim says he went to Dresden, Germany, on the day after his morphine night in the British compound in the center of the extermination camp for Russian prisoners of war. Billy woke up at dawn on that day in January. There were no windows in the little hospital, and the ghostly candles had gone out. So the only light came from pinprick holes in the walls, and from a sketchy rectangle that outlined the imperfectly fitted door. Little Paul Lazzaro, with a broken arm, snored on one bed.

I would have no recollection of what I might have said. I would have to ask what I had been talking about, and it was always news to me.

Fred made me a messenger, which must have been a terrible blow for the messenger service he had been using. Somebody who desperately needed a job, any kind of job, must have been thrown out of work when Fred gave me a handful of subway tokens and a map of New York City.\nHe also set me the task of cataloguing all the valuable objects in Gregory\u2019s studio.\n\u201cWon\u2019t that bother Mr. Gregory while he\u2019s working?\u201d I said.\nAnd he said: \u201cYou could saw him off at the waist while singing \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner,\u2019 and he wouldn\u2019t notice. Just keep away from his eyes and hands.\u201d\nSo I was up in the studio, just a few feet from Dan Gregory, itemizing in a ledger his extensive collection of bayonets, when Marilee came home. I remember still how full of bad magic all those spearpoints to be put on the ends of rifles seemed to be. One was like a sharpened curtain rod. Another was triangular in cross-section, so that the wound it made wouldn\u2019t close up again and keep the blood and guts from falling out. Another one had sawteeth\u2014so it could work its way through bone, I guess. I can remember thinking that war was so horrible that, at last, thank goodness, nobody could ever be fooled by romantic pictures and fiction and history into marching to war again.\nNowadays, of course, you can buy a machine gun with a plastic bayonet for your little kid at the nearest toy boutique.\nThe sounds of Marilee\u2019s homecoming floated up from down below. I myself, so much in her debt, didn\u2019t hurry down to greet her. I think the cook and my first wife were right: I have always been leery of women\u2014possibly because, as Circe Berman suggested at breakfast this morning, I considered my mother faithless, since she had up and died on me.\nMaybe so.\nAnyway: she had to send for me, and I behaved with formality. I did not know that Gregory had almost killed her because of the art materials she had sent to me. If I had known that, I might still have been very formal. One thing, surely, which prevented my being effusive, was my sense of my own homeliness and powerlessness and virginity. I was unworthy of her, since she was as beautiful as Madeleine Carroll, the most beautiful of all movie stars.", 0.08093867243867243], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["farrell",

the family\u2014 perhaps as a representative of the generation of American writers most influenced by James T. Farrell. I was not a close friend. Many of you were, and I envy you that. I knew him some. I found him easy to love and admire. He was eighteen years my senior.\n\u201cHere is what he did for me and many like me when I was very young: He showed me through his books that it was perfectly all right, perhaps even useful and beautiful, to say what life really looked like, what was really said and felt and done\u2014what really went on. Until I read him, I wished only to be well received in polite company.\n\u201cWe were both University of Chicago people.\n\u201cI note that there is a cross over his casket. That is a nice try by whoever put it there, but it is surely known in heaven that James T. Farrell of Chicago and New York was not among our leaders in organized tub-beating for Jesus Christ. He took his chances that way. If he is being scolded at this moment at the Pearly Gates, it may be for his overemphasis of rationality and compassion and honor at the expense of piety. I fear not for him. This is an argument he has won before.\n\u201cThe last time I was in this melancholy depot, it was to say farewell to Janet Flanner, another midwesterner who became a planetary patriot. Ms. Flanner and Mr. Farrell were members of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Ms. Flanner came regularly to the annual spring meeting of that organization. So do many of our leading culture heroes. James T. Farrell never came. One time I asked him why not. He said that he did not care to come face to face with some of the critics, fellow writers, who had damned his work years ago\u2014had damned it ostensibly for bad writing, but actually for the supposedly incorrect political opinions he was known to hold. He was a premature anti-Stalinist. He was, and remained so to his death, a left-wing thinking man.\n\u201cThe malicious attacks did not humble him, could not humble him, since he was Irish. They did, however, so muddy his reputation that a dispassionate appraisal of his life\u2019s work remains to be made. It is a huge work. It is Balzacian in scale. I spoke at his seventy-third birthday, two years ago, and I suggested that, if only James T. Farrell had produced such a body of work in a smaller country, he would have won a Nobel prize by then. That was a strong statement. It had the added force of ringing true.\n\u201cThe ancient Greeks believed, or some of them did, anyway, that a person could not be said to have lived well if he or she died in unhappy circumstances. This is a deservedly unpopular opinion in America, where so many lives end abominably, almost as a matter of routine. But let us suppose that the Greeks were right. By their hard standards we can say that the American writer James T. Farrell had a wonderful life. He died in his sleep, in the presence of deep love such as the world has seldom seen\u2014and owing no one an apology for anything.\n\u201cHe was a sports nut, of course\u2014and once an athlete of great and varied skills. So it is appropriate if we now address our memories of him in this fashion: \u2019You won, you won.\u2019\u201d\n7\nPLAYMATES", 0.23288678712591757], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["ruth", 0.061855670103092786], ["faulkner", 0.05154639175257732], ["buy", 0.030927835051546393], ["dish", 0.030927835051546393], ["held", 0.020618556701030927], ["sacred", 0.020618556701030927], ["fragments", 0.020618556701030927], ["touch", 0.020618556701030927], ["boy", 0.020618556701030927], ["shelf", 0.020618556701030927], ["forgive", 0.020618556701030927], ["cabinet", 0.020618556701030927], ["understand", 0.020618556701030927], ["king", 0.020618556701030927], ["instantly", 0.010309278350515464], ["horses", 0.010309278350515464], ["tragically", 0.010309278350515464], ["pointing", 0.010309278350515464], ["thin", 0.010309278350515464], ["tottered", 0.010309278350515464], ["dear", 0.010309278350515464], ["child", 0.010309278350515464], ["ted", 0.010309278350515464], ["phone", 0.010309278350515464], ["second", 0.010309278350515464], ["aggressiveness", 0.010309278350515464], ["face", 0.010309278350515464], ["open", 0.010309278350515464], ["knees", 0.010309278350515464], ["cried", 0.010309278350515464], ["floor", 0.010309278350515464], ["stay", 0.010309278350515464], ["fingers", 0.010309278350515464], ["tightly", 0.010309278350515464], ["collar", 0.010309278350515464], ["better", 0.010309278350515464], ["startled", 0.010309278350515464], ["call", 0.010309278350515464], ["going", 0.010309278350515464], ["behaved", 0.010309278350515464], ["gathered", 0.010309278350515464], ["cloth", 0.010309278350515464], ["men", 0.010309278350515464], ["brushing", 0.010309278350515464], ["dissolved", 0.010309278350515464], ["jerked", 0.010309278350515464], ["trembling", 0.010309278350515464], ["object", 0.010309278350515464], ["small", 0.010309278350515464], ["unseen", 0.010309278350515464], ["hands", 0.010309278350515464], ["backed", 0.010309278350515464], ["bit", 0.010309278350515464], ["hand", 0.010309278350515464], ["chips", 0.010309278350515464], ["white", 0.010309278350515464], ["shoulder", 0.010309278350515464], ["heaven", 0.010309278350515464], ["mercy", 0.010309278350515464], ["pitiability", 0.010309278350515464], ["sleeve", 0.010309278350515464], ["mended", 0.010309278350515464], ["coat", 0.010309278350515464], ["candy", 0.010309278350515464], ["helplessly", 0.010309278350515464], ["audience", 0.010309278350515464], ["ounce", 0.010309278350515464], ["turned", 0.010309278350515464], ["clay", 0.010309278350515464], ["smashed", 0.010309278350515464], ["cab", 0.010309278350515464], ["expression", 0.010309278350515464], ["quavered", 0.010309278350515464], ["left", 0.010309278350515464]], "sentiment": ["Startled, Ruth jerked her shoulder away from the cabinet.

I will say you\u2019ve shown up what thin stuff clergymen were peddling, most of them. When I had a congregation before the war, I used to tell them that the life of their spirit in relation to God was the biggest thing in their lives, and that their part in the economy was nothing by comparison. Now, you people have engineered them out of their part in the economy, in the market place, and they\u2019re finding out\u2014most of them\u2014that what\u2019s left is just about zero. A good bit short of enough, anyway. My glass is empty.\u201d\nLasher sighed. \u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d he said. \u201cFor generations they\u2019ve been built up to worship competition and the market, productivity and economic usefulness, and the envy of their fellow men\u2014and boom! it\u2019s all yanked out from under them. They can\u2019t participate, can\u2019t be useful any more. Their whole culture\u2019s been shot to hell. My glass is empty.\u201d\n\u201cI just had it filled again,\u201d said Finnerty.\n\u201cOh, so you did.\u201d Lasher sipped thoughtfully. \u201cThese displaced people need something, and the clergy can\u2019t give it to them\u2014or it\u2019s impossible for them to take what the clergy offers. The clergy says it\u2019s enough, and so does the Bible. The people say it isn\u2019t enough, and I suspect they\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cIf they were so fond of the old system, how come they were so cantankerous about their jobs when they had them?\u201d said Paul.\n\u201cOh, this business we\u2019ve got now\u2014it\u2019s been going on for a long time now, not just since the last war. Maybe the actual jobs weren\u2019t being taken from the people, but the sense of participation, the sense of importance was. Go to the library sometime and take a look at magazines and newspapers clear back as far as World War II. Even then there was a lot of talk about know-how winning the war of production\u2014know-how, not people, not the mediocre people running most of the machines. And the hell of it was that it was pretty much true. Even then, half the people or more didn\u2019t understand much about the machines they worked at or the things they were making. They were participating in the economy all right, but not in a way that was very satisfying to the ego. And then there was all this let\u2019s-not-shoot-Father-Christmas advertising.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d said Paul.\n\u201cYou know\u2014those ads about the American system, meaning managers and engineers, that made America great. When you finished one, you\u2019d think the managers and engineers had given America everything: forests, rivers, minerals, mountains, oil\u2014the works.\n\u201cStrange business,\u201d said Lasher. \u201cThis crusading spirit of the managers and engineers, the idea of designing and manufacturing and distributing being sort of a holy war: all that folklore was cooked up by public relations and advertising men hired by managers and engineers to make big business popular in the old days, which it certainly wasn\u2019t in the beginning. Now, the engineers and managers believe with all their hearts the glorious things their forebears hired people to say about them.

It made them think up reasons of their own for why Free Enterprise was the only system worth considering. \u201cPeople are never stronger,\u201d I said, \u201cthan when they have thought up their own arguments for believing what they believe.

I honestly couldn\u2019t imagine how I might have caused Tex pain. When I made love to his wife, I only wanted to make the 2 of us happier. I didn\u2019t think of her as somebody\u2019s wife. When I make love to a woman, the farthest thing from my mind is whom she may be married to. I can\u2019t speak for Zuzu, but I myself had no wish to cause Tex even a little pain.
