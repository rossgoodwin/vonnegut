to be convinced that such a force exists, what with its destructive effects on display in every national capital. I think humanity has always had an inkling that this sort of force does exist. It has been common knowledge that some people are luckier than others with inanimate objects like dice. What Professor Barnhouse did was to show that such \"luck\" was a measurable force, which in his case could be enormous.\nBy my calculations, the professor was about fifty-five times more powerful than a Nagasaki-type atomic bomb at the time he went into hiding. He was not bluffing when, on the eve of \"Operation Brainstorm,\" he told General Honus Barker: \"Sitting here at the dinner table, I\u2019m pretty sure I can flatten anything on earth\u2014from Joe Louis to the Great Wall of China.\"\nThere is an understandable tendency to look upon Professor Barnhouse as a supernatural visitation. The First Church of Barnhouse in Los Angeles has a congregation numbering in the thousands. He is godlike in neither appearance nor intellect. The man who disarms the world is single, shorter than the average American male, stout, and averse to exercise. His I.Q. is 143, which is good but certainly not sensational. He is quite mortal, about to celebrate his fortieth birthday, and in good health. If he is alone now, the isolation won\u2019t bother him too much. He was quiet and shy when I knew him, and seemed to find more companionship in books and music than in his associations at the college.\nNeither he nor his powers fall outside the sphere of Nature. His dynamopsychic radiations are subject to many known physical laws that apply in the field of radio. Hardly a person has not now heard the snarl of \"Barnhouse static\" on his home receiver. The radiations are affected by sunspots and variations in the ionosphere.\nHowever, they differ from ordinary broadcast waves in several important ways. Their total energy can be brought to bear on any single point the professor chooses, and that energy is undiminished by distance. As a weapon, then, dynamopsychism has an impressive advantage over bacteria and atomic bombs, beyond the fact that it costs nothing to use: it enables the professor to single out critical individuals and objects instead of slaughtering whole populations in the process. of maintaining international equilibrium.\nAs General Honus Barker told the House Military Affairs Committee: \"Until someone finds Barnhouse, there is no defense against the Barnhouse Effect.\" Efforts to \"jam\" or block the radiations have failed. Premier Slezak could have saved himself the fantastic expense of his \"Barnhouseproof \u2019 shelter. Despite the shelter\u2019s twelve-foot-thick lead armor, the premier has been floored twice while in it.\nThere is talk of screening the population for men potentially as powerful dynamopsychically as the professor. Senator Warren Foust demanded funds for this purpose last month, with the passionate declaration: \"He who rules the Barnhouse Effect rules the world!\" Commissar Kropotnik said much the same thing, so another costly armaments race, with a new twist, has begun.\nThis race at least has its comical aspects. The world\u2019s best gamblers are being coddled by governments like so many nuclear physicists. There may be several hundred persons with dynamopsychic talent on earth, myself included. But, without knowledge of the professor\u2019s technique, they can never be anything but dice-table despots. With the secret, it would probably take them ten years to become dangerous weapons. It took the professor that long. He who rules the Barnhouse Effect is Barnhouse and will be for some time.\nPopularly, the \"Age of Barnhouse\" is said to have begun a year and a half ago, on the day of Operation Brainstorm. That was when dynamopsychism became significant politically. Actually, the phenomenon was discovered in May, 1942, shortly after the professor turned down a direct commission in the Army and enlisted as an artillery private.

Her price is too high and her services too limited, and he is too busy anyway. He goes and bangs on Jekyll\u2019s door. Nobody is home. He sings to the audience that his client and closest friend, Dr. Jekyll, has just written a will leaving everything to a man named Hyde, about whom Utterson has never heard before. He fears that Jekyll has gone insane or is being blackmailed. He gives up, dickers briefly with the whore again, goes into pub for a needed drink.\nJERRY, now as the monstrous Mr. Hyde, peers furtively out the secret lab door, sees nobody around but the whore. He whistles to her, crooks his finger at her. She is appalled, but needs the work. She goes into the lab with him, and the door is closed.\nA drunk comes out of the pub, sings a song about the beauty of love, staggers off into the wings.\nThe lab door opens. The whore reels out, her clothes in frightful disarray. Hyde throws money after her, heaps scorn on her as she picks it up. She exits in disorder and shame. Hyde remains in the doorway, looking up and down the street for other opportunities to do evil.\nKIMBERLY enters with her perambulator, on her way home from the park. She seems an ideal target of opportunity. She pauses, giving him a chance to duck into the lab to get a black spherical bomb with a fuse sticking out of it, which he shows to the audience. She starts coming again, and he stops her, pretending to be solicitous, hiding the bomb behind his back. He tells her that she should be careful, that he thinks someone may be following her. She looks back, and he tucks the bomb in with the baby and lights the fuse.\nShe moves on, looking back over her shoulder, exits. Hyde ducks into lab, closes door.\nThere is a terrific explosion offstage, people come pouring out of the pub, exit in direction of explosion.\nThey return, filled with horror. Some carry pieces of the perambulator. Utterson carries a wheel. Last of all come POPS and KIMBERLY. Pops has his pad and pencil out, trying to get Kimberly\u2019s story. Most of Kimberly\u2019s clothing has been blown away. Her face is black. She still holds the handle of the perambulator.\nUtterson draws aside, muses over the clue of the wheel.

Whoever had a car like that had enough Yen or Marks or some other stable currency to buy himself or herself enough black-market gas for a trip from anywhere to anywhere.\nMy guess was that it was the chariot of some Tarkington student or parent who hoped to recover property left in a dorm suite at the start of the vacation period, a vacation which now, obviously, might never end.\nThe soldier who was supposed to be my receptionist was back on duty. He had returned to his post after General Florio told him to stop standing around with his thumb in his anus and start stringing barbed wire or erecting tents. He was waiting for me at the front door, and he told me I had a visitor.\nSo I asked him, \u201cWho is the visitor?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s your son, sir.\u201d\nI was thunderstruck. \u201cEugene is here?\u201d I said. Eugene Jr. had told me that he never wanted to see me again as long as he lived. How is that for a life sentence? And he was driving a Rolls-Royce now? Eugene?\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cNot Eugene.\u201d\n\u201cEugene is the only son I have,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did he say his name was?\u201d", 0.03545751633986928], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["nicky", 0.06818181818181818], ["ten", 0.030303030303030304], ["father", 0.030303030303030304], ["dollars", 0.022727272727272728], ["rich", 0.022727272727272728], ["check", 0.022727272727272728], ["talked", 0.015151515151515152], ["won", 0.015151515151515152], ["loud", 0.015151515151515152], ["mother", 0.015151515151515152], ["shop", 0.007575757575757576], ["move", 0.007575757575757576], ["grinning", 0.007575757575757576], ["stepping", 0.007575757575757576], ["festooned", 0.007575757575757576], ["cup", 0.007575757575757576], ["inexhaustible", 0.007575757575757576], ["clipped", 0.007575757575757576], ["wet", 0.007575757575757576], ["mail", 0.007575757575757576], ["photographs", 0.007575757575757576], ["coffee", 0.007575757575757576], ["good", 0.007575757575757576], ["gino", 0.007575757575757576], ["returning", 0.007575757575757576], ["big", 0.007575757575757576], ["seemingly", 0.007575757575757576], ["dark", 0.007575757575757576], ["walls", 0.007575757575757576], ["calliope", 0.007575757575757576], ["difference", 0.007575757575757576], ["day", 0.007575757575757576], ["room", 0.007575757575757576], ["clippings", 0.007575757575757576], ["gift", 0.007575757575757576], ["souvenirs", 0.007575757575757576], ["stuff", 0.007575757575757576], ["stopped", 0.007575757575757576], ["enclosing", 0.007575757575757576], ["small", 0.007575757575757576], ["soft", 0.007575757575757576], ["steam", 0.007575757575757576], ["wrote", 0.007575757575757576], ["slow", 0.007575757575757576], ["covered", 0.007575757575757576], ["reached", 0.007575757575757576], ["morning", 0.007575757575757576], ["pajamas", 0.007575757575757576], ["saucer", 0.007575757575757576], ["shower", 0.007575757575757576], ["glistening", 0.007575757575757576], ["filled", 0.007575757575757576], ["body", 0.007575757575757576], ["ends", 0.007575757575757576], ["guess", 0.007575757575757576], ["apartment", 0.007575757575757576], ["marino", 0.007575757575757576], ["memento", 0.007575757575757576], ["wait", 0.007575757575757576], ["months", 0.007575757575757576], ["lied", 0.007575757575757576], ["headed", 0.007575757575757576], ["pot", 0.007575757575757576], ["hearing", 0.007575757575757576], ["hook", 0.007575757575757576], ["wasn", 0.007575757575757576], ["table", 0.007575757575757576], ["singing", 0.007575757575757576], ["bathroom", 0.007575757575757576], ["joking", 0.007575757575757576], ["unknown", 0.007575757575757576], ["top", 0.007575757575757576], ["three", 0.007575757575757576], ["behaved", 0.007575757575757576], ["store", 0.007575757575757576], ["life", 0.007575757575757576], ["volume", 0.007575757575757576], ["expansively", 0.007575757575757576], ["scrapbook", 0.007575757575757576], ["hold", 0.007575757575757576], ["sound", 0.007575757575757576], ["metronome", 0.007575757575757576], ["will", 0.007575757575757576], ["future", 0.007575757575757576], ["newspaper", 0.007575757575757576], ["cracked", 0.007575757575757576], ["owed", 0.007575757575757576], ["uncertainty", 0.007575757575757576], ["talking", 0.007575757575757576], ["rent", 0.007575757575757576], ["bucks", 0.007575757575757576], ["sat", 0.007575757575757576], ["floor", 0.007575757575757576], ["book", 0.007575757575757576], ["earnings", 0.007575757575757576], ["income", 0.007575757575757576], ["truck", 0.007575757575757576], ["nice", 0.007575757575757576], ["garish", 0.007575757575757576], ["trace", 0.007575757575757576], ["cigarette", 0.007575757575757576], ["edges", 0.007575757575757576], ["arrived", 0.007575757575757576], ["sarcastic", 0.007575757575757576], ["letter", 0.007575757575757576], ["posters", 0.007575757575757576], ["ragged", 0.007575757575757576], ["snapshot", 0.007575757575757576]], "sentiment": ["Nicky Marino was in the shower, singing with the volume of a steam calliope when I arrived. I sat down in the one-room apartment to wait.\nThe walls were covered with photographs of his father, and with old posters headed by his father\u2019s name. On the table, beside a pot of coffee, a cracked cup in a cigarette-filled saucer, and a metronome, was a scrapbook, its edges festooned with the ragged ends of newspaper clippings about his father.\nOn the floor were his garish pajamas and the morning mail\u2014a letter with a check and a snapshot clipped to it. It was from his mother, who never wrote without enclosing some memento of his father from a seemingly inexhaustible store of souvenirs. The check was from the earnings of her small gift shop, and, little as the check was, Nicky had to make it last, for he had no other income.\n\u201cHow did that sound?\u201d said Nicky, stepping from the bathroom, his big dark, slow body glistening wet.\n\u201cHow should I know?
