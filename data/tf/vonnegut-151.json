He spent much of his time in the neighborhood of the island\u2019s only water supply, which was a spring at the base of the crater. When people came to get water, he would receive them as though he were the kindly and knowledgeable master of the spring, its assistant and conservator. He would tell even the Kanka-bonos, who never understood a word he said, how the spring was that day\u2014characterizing its dribbling from a crack in a rock as being \u201c\u2026 very nervous today,\u201d or \u201c\u2026 very cheerful today,\u201d or \u201c\u2026 very lazy today,\u201d or whatever.\nThe dribbling was in fact quite steady, and had been for thousands of years before the colonists got there, and remains so, although people no longer have to depend on it, to the present day. Here was how it worked, and it didn\u2019t take a graduate of the United States Naval Academy to understand its mysteries: The crater was an enormous bowl which caught rainwater, which it hid from the sunshine beneath a very thick layer of volcanic debris. There was a slow leak in the bowl, which was the spring.\nThere was no way in which the Captain, with so much time on his hands, might have improved the spring. The water already dribbled most satisfactorily from a crack in a lava boulder, and was already caught in a natural basin ten centimeters below. That basin was and still is about the size of the washbasin in the lavatory off the main saloon of the Walloping Window Blind. If emptied, that basin, with or without encouragement from the Captain, would in twenty-three minutes and eleven seconds, as timed by Mandarax, be brimming full again.\nHow would I describe the declining years of the Captain? I would have to say that he felt quietly desperate. But he surely needn\u2019t have been marooned on Santa Rosalia in order to feel that way.\nQuoth Mandarax:", -0.015249042145593887], "title": "Galapagos"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["trout", 0.088], ["milo", 0.056], ["city", 0.04], ["kilgore", 0.04], ["midland", 0.032], ["person", 0.032], ["television", 0.024], ["will", 0.024], ["people", 0.016], ["ga", 0.016], ["spanish", 0.016], ["curtain", 0.016], ["maritimo", 0.016], ["knew", 0.016], ["style", 0.016], ["wasn", 0.016], ["hidden", 0.016], ["audience", 0.016], ["consisted", 0.016], ["days", 0.008], ["looked", 0.008], ["rapture", 0.008], ["miller", 0.008], ["desk", 0.008], ["discover", 0.008], ["meter", 0.008], ["years", 0.008], ["discovered", 0.008], ["stroke", 0.008], ["simply", 0.008], ["dropped", 0.008], ["luminous", 0.008], ["machines", 0.008], ["sat", 0.008], ["adoration", 0.008], ["truth", 0.008], ["wishful", 0.008], ["cameras", 0.008], ["crust", 0.008], ["arms", 0.008], ["thinking", 0.008], ["neutralized", 0.008], ["going", 0.008], ["master", 0.008], ["greatness", 0.008], ["ordinary", 0.008], ["stage", 0.008], ["mary", 0.008], ["hope", 0.008], ["fairly", 0.008], ["life", 0.008], ["champion", 0.008], ["anecdotes", 0.008], ["remembered", 0.008], ["greeted", 0.008], ["famous", 0.008], ["breast", 0.008], ["settee", 0.008], ["child", 0.008], ["front", 0.008], ["lobby", 0.008], ["ceremonies", 0.008], ["women", 0.008], ["entire", 0.008], ["vending", 0.008], ["longer", 0.008], ["room", 0.008], ["upper", 0.008], ["country", 0.008], ["older", 0.008], ["acknowledged", 0.008], ["alice", 0.008], ["walked", 0.008], ["air", 0.008], ["conversation", 0.008], ["brocaded", 0.008], ["deflated", 0.008], ["popular", 0.008], ["works", 0.008], ["lines", 0.008]], "sentiment": ["Milo Maritimo greeted Trout with luminous adoration. \u201cMr. Trout,\u201d he said in rapture, \u201cI\u2019d know you anywhere.

The show Milo\u2019s line was from consisted of taking some old person, usually fairly famous, into what looked like an ordinary room, only it was actually a stage, with an audience out front and television cameras hidden all around. There were also people who had known the person in the older days hidden around.

They were husband and wife. I remember their names well enough, but I will call them \u201cBud and Mary Swan.\u201d This was at a time when securities had become nearly worthless, when many banks had closed forever. Factories and stores were dead. But the Swans had arrived in a new Marmon, and Mrs. Swan had a new fur coat and a new star sapphire ring.\nWe all had to look out through the front door at the car, and then at the coat and the ring. So Mother and Father, with their nice manners, said they were glad that things were going so well for the Swans. The whole thing looked fishy to me. Everybody else was broke. Where would the Swans get all that money? It was as though this one couple had been allowed to defy the law of gravity.\nMother and Father told me to take another look at the sapphire, so I could see the beautiful star in there. So I did. But then, to get a better understanding of what was going on, I asked Mr. Swan how much the ring had cost him. That was when Father hit me. He hit me with an underhand blow to the seat of my pants. It lofted me in the direction of the staircase, and I just kept on going upstairs to my bedroom. I was mad.\nNow then: As my parents would eventually discover, to their grief, the Swans were cat\u2019s-paws for confidence men. They had been bankrolled by crooks to put on a show for friends of theirs who might still have a little money squirreled away somewhere. My parents would want to know where the Swans got all their easy money. My parents needed some easy money, too. If they didn\u2019t find it somewhere, they would be bounced forever from the upper class. As I say, I myself had already sunk into the lower orders.\nThe Swans said that they had invested what little they had left after the crash of the securities market in a wonderful company which wanted to keep itself a secret. It was quietly putting together a coal monopoly which would be as rich and powerful as Standard Oil. It was buying mines and barge lines and controlling interest in coal-hauling railroads, was getting them for a minor fraction of their true value since it was paying cash. Almost nobody else had cash. The cash was coming from individuals like the Swans and my parents, who could keep a secret, and who could scrape up a little something from the bottoms of their barrels, if they really tried.\nThe value of the company would increase at least a hundred times, the instant prosperity returned to the world. Meanwhile, the company was already paying dividends because it was so efficient. It was the dividends which had bought the Marmon and the coat and the star sapphire ring.\nMy parents of course invested. They found buyers somewhere, I suppose, for some of their oil paintings or oriental rugs, or for some of Father\u2019s fine guns. During the boom years, Father had been a collector of guns.\nMy parents had been taught such nice manners in childhood that it was actually impossible for them to suspect that these old friends of theirs were in league with crooks. They had no simple and practical vocabularies for the parts and functions of their excretory and reproductive systems, and no such vocabularies for treachery and hypocrisy, either. Good manners had made them defenseless against predatory members of their own class.\nThere we have our old friend peer pressure again, of course.\nAnd there was no coal monopoly, of course. Whoever got my parents\u2019 money spent most of it on racehorses and chorus girls, probably, except for maybe a quarter of it, which they sent to the Swans as dividends.", 0.07926515151515152], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["black", 0.050505050505050504], ["prison", 0.050505050505050504], ["white", 0.04040404040404041], ["matter", 0.030303030303030304], ["break", 0.030303030303030304], ["race", 0.030303030303030304], ["winged", 0.020202020202020204], ["imagine", 0.020202020202020204], ["wasn", 0.020202020202020204], ["capitalizing", 0.020202020202020204], ["news", 0.020202020202020204], ["transferred", 0.020202020202020204], ["supposed", 0.020202020202020204], ["called", 0.020202020202020204], ["days", 0.010101010101010102], ["shot", 0.010101010101010102], ["missile", 0.010101010101010102], ["national", 0.010101010101010102], ["microsurgery", 0.010101010101010102], ["library", 0.010101010101010102], ["general", 0.010101010101010102], ["escapee", 0.010101010101010102], ["troy", 0.010101010101010102], ["lawyer", 0.010101010101010102], ["claimed", 0.010101010101010102], ["nephew", 0.010101010101010102], ["stand", 0.010101010101010102], ["mayor", 0.010101010101010102], ["reasons", 0.010101010101010102], ["guess", 0.010101010101010102], ["ancestors", 0.010101010101010102], ["appear", 0.010101010101010102], ["camping", 0.010101010101010102], ["tremendous", 0.010101010101010102], ["transfer", 0.010101010101010102], ["ships", 0.010101010101010102], ["handed", 0.010101010101010102], ["libraries", 0.010101010101010102], ["feel", 0.010101010101010102], ["converted", 0.010101010101010102], ["forest", 0.010101010101010102], ["lot", 0.010101010101010102], ["cruisers", 0.010101010101010102], ["wanting", 0.010101010101010102], ["ancestor", 0.010101010101010102], ["public", 0.010101010101010102], ["smart", 0.010101010101010102], ["athena", 0.010101010101010102], ["credit", 0.010101010101010102], ["big", 0.010101010101010102], ["hand", 0.010101010101010102], ["matters", 0.010101010101010102], ["bang", 0.010101010101010102], ["tv", 0.010101010101010102], ["inmates", 0.010101010101010102], ["half", 0.010101010101010102], ["punishment", 0.010101010101010102], ["law", 0.010101010101010102], ["sorts", 0.010101010101010102], ["aircraft", 0.010101010101010102], ["raise", 0.010101010101010102], ["10", 0.010101010101010102], ["clamor", 0.010101010101010102], ["blacks", 0.010101010101010102], ["lost", 0.010101010101010102], ["carriers", 0.010101010101010102], ["miracle", 0.010101010101010102], ["times", 0.010101010101010102], ["person", 0.010101010101010102], ["forgotten", 0.010101010101010102], ["popular", 0.010101010101010102], ["feeling", 0.010101010101010102], ["repaired", 0.010101010101010102], ["left", 0.010101010101010102]], "sentiment": ["But the only person who wasn\u2019t an escapee who got shot just for being black was a nephew of the Mayor of Troy.
