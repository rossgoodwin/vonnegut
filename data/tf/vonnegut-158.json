much that he had written two symphonies or knew anything about windmills, or that he could even ski.\nHe complained constantly about the beeping sounds Mandarax made when she pressed the different buttons, although they could hardly be heard, and although he knew how rewarding it was for her to improve her mind, to memorize famous quotations and to learn new languages and so on.\nHe would rather choke to death than ever say, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd those are just the four big ones,\u201d she said. So there was a great deal of pent-up resentment coming out when Mary spoke to the Captain as she did about marine-iguana spit.\nI can\u2019t see that the breakup was tragic, since there were no dependent children involved, and neither party found living alone absolutely unendurable. Both were visited regularly by Akiko, and then, after Kamikaze sprouted a beard, Akiko had furry children of her own to bring along.\nMary was accorded no special status by the Kanka-bono women, although she had made it possible for them to have babies. They and then their children feared her as much as they feared the Captain, believing her capable of doing great evil as well as good.\nAnd twenty years went by. Hisako and Selena had committed suicide by drowning eight years before. Akiko was now a matronly thirty-nine years old, the mother of seven furry children by Kamikaze\u2014two boys and five girls. She was fluent in three languages without the help of Mandarax: English, Japanese, and Kanka-bono. Her children spoke only Kanka-bono, except for two English words: Grandpa and Grandma. That was what she had them call the Captain and Mary Hepburn. That was what she herself called them.\nOne morning, at seven-thirty A.M. on May 9, 2016, according to *Mandarax, Akiko woke *Mary, and told her that she should go make her peace with the *Captain, who was so sick that he would probably not last out the day. Akiko had visited him the previous evening, and had sent her children home and stayed and nursed him through the night, although there was very little she could do for him.\nSo *Mary went, although she was no longer any spring chicken herself. She was eighty\u2014and toothless. Her spine was shaped like a question mark, thanks, according to *Mandarax, to the ravages of osteoporosis. She didn\u2019t need *Mandarax to tell her it was osteoporosis. Her mother and grandmother\u2019s bones were made as weak as reeds by osteoporosis before they died.

They didn\u2019t want Niggers in their town, so they put up signs on the main roads at the city limits and in the railroad yard.\u201d Dwayne\u2019s stepfather described the signs, which looked like this:\n\u201cOne night\u2014\u201d Dwayne\u2019s stepfather said, \u201ca Nigger family got off a boxcar in Shepherdstown. Maybe they didn\u2019t see the sign. Maybe they couldn\u2019t read it. Maybe they couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Dwayne\u2019s stepfather was out of work when he told the story so gleefully. The Great Depression had just begun. He and Dwayne were on a weekly expedition in the family car, hauling garbage and trash out into the country, where they dumped it all in Sugar Creek.\n\u201cAnyway, they moved into an empty shack that night,\u201d Dwayne\u2019s stepfather went on. \u201cThey got a fire going in the stove and all. So a mob went down there at midnight. They took out the man, and they sawed him in two on the top strand of a barbed-wire fence.\u201d Dwayne remembered clearly that a rainbow of oil from the trash was spreading prettily over the surface of Sugar Creek when he heard that.\n\u201cSince that night, which was a long time ago now,\u201d his stepfather said, \u201cthere ain\u2019t been a Nigger even spend the night in Shepherdstown.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTrout was itchingly aware that Dwayne was staring at his bosom so loonily. Dwayne\u2019s eyes swam, and Trout supposed they were swimming in alcohol. He could not know that Dwayne was seeing an oil slick on Sugar Creek which had made rainbows forty long years ago.\nTrout was aware of me, too, what little he could see of me. I made him even more uneasy than Dwayne did. The thing was: Trout was the only character I ever created who had enough imagination to suspect that he might be the creation of another human being. He had spoken of this possibility several times to his parakeet. He had said, for instance, \u201cHonest to God, Bill, the way things are going, all I can think of is that I\u2019m a character in a book by somebody who wants to write about somebody who suffers all the time.\u201d\nNow Trout was beginning to catch on that he was sitting very close to the person who had created him. He was embarrassed. It was hard for him to know how to respond, particularly since his responses were going to be anything I said they were.\nI went easy on him, didn\u2019t wave, didn\u2019t stare.

The sailboats were jobs and shares in the Vonnegut Hardware Company.\nSeventy-four years later, the Vonnegut Hardware Company exists no more. The \u201cMile Square\u201d in the heart of Indianapolis, where it once had its bustling main store, is a desert of parking lots now. At night the Mile Square is as eerily desolate as East Berlin.

Some of the convicts who stayed in or near Athena after the great escape, rather than attack Scipio across the ice, felt that at least they could bust up the A. J. Topf und Sohn crematorium.\nThe Meadowdale Cinema Complex itself has gone belly up, since so few people can afford to own an automobile anymore.\nSame thing with the shopping malls.\nONE THING INTERESTING to me, although I don\u2019t know quite what to make of it, is that the Mafia never sells anything to foreigners. While everybody else who has inherited or built a real business can\u2019t wait to sell out and take early retirement, the Mafia holds on to everything. Thus does the paving business, for example, remain a strictly American enterprise.\nSame thing with wholesale meat and napkins and tablecloths for restaurants.\nI TOLD THE Warden right up front that I had been canned by Tarkington. I explained that the charges against me for sexual irregularities were a smokescreen. The Trustees were really angry about my having wobbled the students\u2019 faith in the intelligence and decency of their country\u2019s leadership by telling them the truth about the Vietnam War.\n\u201cNobody on this side of the lake believes there is such a thing in this miserable country,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSuch a thing as what, sir?\u201d I said.\nAnd he said, \u201cLeadership.\u201d As for my sexual irregularities, he said, they seemed to be uniformly heterosexual, and there were no women on his side of the lake. He himself was a bachelor, and members of his staff were not allowed to bring their wives with them, if they had them. \u201cSo over here,\u201d he said, \u201cyou would truly be Don Juan in Hell.

Methaqualone had persuaded him that he and Celia had been high school sweethearts, and that he should have married her. \u201cShe was what I was looking for all the time, and I never even realized it,\u201d he said.\nI think now that Mother and I should have driven him to the County Hospital for detoxification. But we got into his car with him, and told him where the funeral was. The top was down, which was no way to go to a funeral, and Felix himself was a mess. His necktie was askew, and his shirt was filthy, and he had a two-day growth of beard. He had found time to buy a Rolls-Royce, but it hadn\u2019t occurred to him that he might have bought some new shirts with buttons, too. He wasn\u2019t going to have another shirt with buttons until he could find some woman who would sew all his buttons on.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nOff we went to the First Methodist Church, with Felix at the wheel and Mother in the back seat. As luck would have it, Felix almost closed the peephole of his first wife, Donna, as she was getting out of her Thunderbird in front of her twin sister\u2019s house on Arsenal Avenue. It would have been her fault, if she had died, since she didn\u2019t look to see what was coming before she disembarked on the driver\u2019s side. But it would have made for an ugly case in court, since Felix had already put her through a windshield once, and he was still paying her a lot of alimony, and the business about all the pills he was taking would have come out, and so on. Worst of all, as far as a jury was concerned, I\u2019m sure, would have been the fact that he was a bloated plutocrat in a Rolls-Royce.\nFelix didn\u2019t even recognize her, and I don\u2019t think she recognized him, either. When I told him who it was he had almost hit, he spoke of her most unkindly. He recalled that her scalp was crisscrossed with scars, because of her trip through the windshield. When he used to run his fingers through her hair, he would encounter those scars, and he would get this crazy idea that he was a quarterback. \u201cI would look downfield for an end who was open for a forward pass,\u201d he said.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was at the church, though, that Felix and his good friend methaqualone became embarrassing. We got there late, so we had to sit toward the back, where those least concerned with the deceased should have been sitting anyway. If we were going to make any disturbance, people would have to swivel around in their pews to see who we were.\nThe service started quietly enough. I heard only one person crying, and she was way up front, and I think it was Lottie Davis, the Hoovers\u2019 black maid. She and Dwayne were the only people there to do a whole lot of crying, since practically nobody else had seen Celia for seven years\u2014since she had starred in Katmandu.\nHer son wasn\u2019t there.", -0.04169528619528619], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["harry", 0.07228915662650602], ["bang", 0.04819277108433735], ["laird", 0.03614457831325301], ["hand", 0.03614457831325301], ["amy", 0.03614457831325301], ["libbin", 0.024096385542168676], ["sentence", 0.024096385542168676], ["pilla", 0.024096385542168676], ["hru", 0.024096385542168676], ["tu", 0.024096385542168676], ["better", 0.024096385542168676], ["sibba", 0.024096385542168676], ["gun", 0.024096385542168676], ["steek", 0.024096385542168676], ["repeated", 0.024096385542168676], ["donna", 0.024096385542168676], ["fish", 0.012048192771084338], ["turned", 0.012048192771084338], ["bring", 0.012048192771084338], ["adulation", 0.012048192771084338], ["good", 0.012048192771084338], ["held", 0.012048192771084338], ["terrace", 0.012048192771084338], ["laugh", 0.012048192771084338], ["twitched", 0.012048192771084338], ["sat", 0.012048192771084338], ["perfect", 0.012048192771084338], ["dying", 0.012048192771084338], ["simca", 0.012048192771084338], ["young", 0.012048192771084338], ["grim", 0.012048192771084338], ["buhna", 0.012048192771084338], ["gin", 0.012048192771084338], ["imperiously", 0.012048192771084338], ["tigers", 0.012048192771084338], ["tiger", 0.012048192771084338], ["sympathetic", 0.012048192771084338], ["tonic", 0.012048192771084338], ["woman", 0.012048192771084338], ["boy", 0.012048192771084338], ["stung", 0.012048192771084338], ["trees", 0.012048192771084338], ["bagombo", 0.012048192771084338], ["smile", 0.012048192771084338], ["baby", 0.012048192771084338], ["brushed", 0.012048192771084338], ["riverbank", 0.012048192771084338], ["frowning", 0.012048192771084338], ["earn", 0.012048192771084338], ["ahead", 0.012048192771084338], ["purposeful", 0.012048192771084338], ["cover", 0.012048192771084338], ["cautiously", 0.012048192771084338], ["translated", 0.012048192771084338], ["problem", 0.012048192771084338], ["clump", 0.012048192771084338], ["south", 0.012048192771084338], ["natives", 0.012048192771084338]], "sentiment": ["Cautiously Amy repeated the sentence.\n\u201cPerfect!
