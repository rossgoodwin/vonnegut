There was no need for Anita\u2019s coming to court to show the world how she felt about her erring husband. She had made that clear in several interviews with the press. She had married Paul, she\u2019d explained, when she was but a child, and she thanked God things had come to a head while she was still young enough to salvage a little real happiness for herself. \u201cSalvage\u201d seemed a particularly apt term to Paul, with its implications of picking over city dumps and dragging harbor bottoms, for Anita had announced in her next breath that she was going to marry Doctor Lawson Shepherd as soon as she could get a divorce from Paul.\nPaul had read her public declarations with ennui, as though they were gossip about someone else, about a television starlet\u2019s accusations against a middle-aged producer, say. The thing he concentrated on now, a far more entertaining and consequential enterprise, was the saying of as many poignant, antimachine, pro-Ghost Shirt Society things as he could over a nationwide television network.\n\u201cThis use of force\u2014you don\u2019t regard that as a levying of war against the United States, as treason, Doctor?\u201d wheedled the prosecutor.\n\u201cThe sovereignty of the United States resides in the people, not in the machines, and it\u2019s the people\u2019s to take back, if they so wish.
