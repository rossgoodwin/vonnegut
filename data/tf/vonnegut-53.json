Party,\u201d and copies of the four other stories Trout threw away in front of the Academy before the timequake hit, is due to Dudley Prince. The first time through, when the decade was original material, he continued to believe, as Monica Pepper did not, that a bag lady was using the trash receptacle for a mailbox, knowing he would be watching her crazy dances through the whoozit in the steel front door.\nPrince retrieved each story and pondered it, hoping to discover some important message from a higher power encoded therein. After work, rerun or not, this was a lonely African-American.\n20\nIn the summer of 2001 at Xanadu, Dudley Prince handed Trout the sheaf of stories, which Trout had expected the Department of Sanitation to incinerate or bury or drop in the ocean far offshore before anyone other than himself had read them. By his own account to me, Trout riffled through the scruffy pages with distaste, while seated tailor-fashion and naked on his king-size bed in the Ernest Hemingway Suite. The day was hot. He was fresh from his Jacuzzi.\nBut then his gaze fell upon the scene in which two anti-Semitic children teach Bingo to high-ranking Nazis in their madly theatrical uniforms. In amazed admiration for something brilliant he himself had written, and Trout had never thought of himself as worth a hill of beans as a writer, he praised the scene as an echo of this prophecy from the Book of Isaiah:\n\u201cThe wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.\u201d\nA fatling is any young animal fattened for slaughter.\n\u201cI read that scene,\u201d Trout told me and Monica, \u201cand I asked myself, \u2018How the hell did I do that?\u2019 \u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d heard a person who had done a remarkable piece of work ask that delightful question. Back in the 1960s, long, long before the timequake, I had a great big old house in Barnstable Village on Cape Cod, where my first wife, Jane Marie Vonnegut, n\u00e9e Cox, and I were raising four boys and two girls. The ell where I did my writing was falling down.\nI had it pulled all the way down and hauled away. I hired my friend Ted Adler, a skilled man-of-all-work my age, to build me a new one like the old one. Ted alone built the forms for the footings. Ted supervised the pouring of concrete from a ready-mix truck. He personally laid concrete blocks atop the footings. He framed the superstructure, put on the sheathing and siding, and shingled the roof and wired the place. He hung the windows and doors. He nailed up and jointed the Sheetrock inside.", 0.15455492424242426], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["billy", 0.046296296296296294], ["cabin", 0.037037037037037035], ["nancy", 0.037037037037037035], ["glasses", 0.027777777777777776], ["champagne", 0.018518518518518517], ["table", 0.018518518518518517], ["wearing", 0.018518518518518517], ["shape", 0.009259259259259259], ["emotions", 0.009259259259259259], ["silk", 0.009259259259259259], ["swan", 0.009259259259259259], ["surroundings", 0.009259259259259259], ["book", 0.009259259259259259], ["dominated", 0.009259259259259259], ["poised", 0.009259259259259259], ["silken", 0.009259259259259259], ["breast", 0.009259259259259259], ["akron", 0.009259259259259259], ["accepted", 0.009259259259259259], ["day", 0.009259259259259259], ["furnishings", 0.009259259259259259], ["desire", 0.009259259259259259], ["shy", 0.009259259259259259], ["marlin", 0.009259259259259259], ["stunningly", 0.009259259259259259], ["ohio", 0.009259259259259259], ["anticlimactically", 0.009259259259259259], ["poet", 0.009259259259259259], ["antique", 0.009259259259259259], ["ten", 0.009259259259259259], ["mahogany", 0.009259259259259259], ["dislodge", 0.009259259259259259], ["manly", 0.009259259259259259], ["candle", 0.009259259259259259], ["pajamas", 0.009259259259259259], ["handholds", 0.009259259259259259], ["bottom", 0.009259259259259259], ["purple", 0.009259259259259259], ["leaded", 0.009259259259259259], ["ice", 0.009259259259259259], ["belching", 0.009259259259259259], ["size", 0.009259259259259259], ["piped", 0.009259259259259259], ["red", 0.009259259259259259], ["voluptuous", 0.009259259259259259], ["men", 0.009259259259259259], ["cockpit", 0.009259259259259259], ["step", 0.009259259259259259], ["heroin", 0.009259259259259259], ["wanted", 0.009259259259259259], ["throw", 0.009259259259259259], ["quart", 0.009259259259259259], ["great", 0.009259259259259259], ["writhing", 0.009259259259259259], ["golden", 0.009259259259259259], ["feel", 0.009259259259259259], ["embarrassed", 0.009259259259259259], ["boat", 0.009259259259259259], ["companionway", 0.009259259259259259], ["seraglio", 0.009259259259259259], ["illegal", 0.009259259259259259], ["arms", 0.009259259259259259], ["collar", 0.009259259259259259], ["forward", 0.009259259259259259], ["happy", 0.009259259259259259], ["firm", 0.009259259259259259], ["door", 0.009259259259259259], ["fire", 0.009259259259259259], ["expected", 0.009259259259259259], ["smile", 0.009259259259259259], ["russian", 0.009259259259259259], ["1910", 0.009259259259259259], ["overwhelming", 0.009259259259259259], ["handsome", 0.009259259259259259], ["room", 0.009259259259259259], ["bucket", 0.009259259259259259], ["bed", 0.009259259259259259], ["supposed", 0.009259259259259259], ["beautiful", 0.009259259259259259], ["middle", 0.009259259259259259], ["dining", 0.009259259259259259], ["complex", 0.009259259259259259], ["holding", 0.009259259259259259], ["separate", 0.009259259259259259], ["humbly", 0.009259259259259259], ["bared", 0.009259259259259259], ["class", 0.009259259259259259], ["lower", 0.009259259259259259], ["glass", 0.009259259259259259], ["calculated", 0.009259259259259259], ["dragon", 0.009259259259259259], ["teeth", 0.009259259259259259], ["grip", 0.009259259259259259]], "sentiment": ["Nancy\u2019s emotions and the antique furnishings of the cabin were so complex that Nancy could not at first separate Billy the Poet from his surroundings, from all the mahogany and leaded glass.

unfinished novel which Eliot had begun years before, on an evening when he understood at last that Sylvia would never come back to him.\nWhy do so many souls voluntarily return to Earth after failing and dying, failing and dying, failing and dying there? Because Heaven is such a null. Over Dem Pearly Gates these words should be emblazoned:\nA LITTLE NOTHING, O GOD, GOES A LONG, LONG WAY.\nBut the only words written on the infinite portal of Paradise are the grafitti of vandal souls. \"Welcome to the Bulgarian World's Fair!\" says a penciled plaint on a pediment of pearl. \"Better red than dead,\" another opines.\n\"You ain't a man till you've had black meat,\" suggests another. And this has been revised to read, \"You ain't a man till you've been black meat.\"\n\"Where can I get a good lay around here?\" asks a bawdy soul, drawing this reply: \"Try 'Lay of the Last Minstrel,' by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.\"\nMy own contribution:\nThose who write on Heaven's walls Should mold their shit in little balls. And those who read these lines of wit Should eat these little balls of shit.\n\"Kublai Khan, Napoleon, Julius Caesar and King Richard the Lion Hearted all stink,\" a brave soul declares. The claim is unchallenged, nor are challenges from the parties insulted likely. The immortal soul of Kublai Khan now inhabits the meek meat of a veterinarian's wife in Lima, Peru. The immortal soul of Bonaparte peers out from the hot and stuffy meat of the fourteen-year-old son of the Harbor Master of Cotuit, Massachusetts. Great Caesar's ghost manages as best it can with the syphilitic meat of a Pygmy widow in the Andaman Islands. Coeur de Lion has found himself once again taken captive during his travels, imprisoned this time in the flesh of Coach Letzinger, a pitiful exhibitionist and freelance garbage man in Rosewater, Indiana. Coach, with poor old King Richard inside, goes to Indianapolis on the Greyhound bus three or four times a year, dresses up for the trip in shoes, socks, garters, a raincoat, and a chromium-plated whistle hung around his neck. When he gets to Indianapolis, Coach goes to the silverware department of one of the big stores, where there are always a lot of brides-to-be picking out silver patterns. Coach blows his whistle, all the girls look, Coach throws open his raincoat, closes it again, and runs like hell to catch the bus back to Rosewater.\nHeaven is the bore of bores, Eliot's novel went on, so most wraiths queue up to be reborn\u2014and they live and love and fail and die, and they queue up to be reborn again. They take pot luck, as the saying goes. They don't gibber and squeak to be one race or another, one sex or another, one nationality or another, one class or another.

And then he went into bootlegging on his own, made a lot of money at it. When the prohibition era ended, Ed Luby went back to his hometown, the old mill town of Ilium. He bought several businesses. One was a restaurant, which he called Ed Luby\u2019s Steak House. It was a very good restaurant. It had a brass knocker on its red front door.\nAt seven o\u2019clock the other night, Harve and Claire Elliot banged on the door with the brass knocker\u2014because the red door was locked. They had come from a city thirty miles away. It was their fourteenth wedding anniversary. They would be celebrating their anniversary at Luby\u2019s for the fourteenth time.\nHarve and Claire Elliot had a lot of kids and a lot of love, and not much money. But once a year they really splurged. They got all dolled up, took twenty dollars out of the sugar bowl, drove over to Ed Luby\u2019s Steak House, and carried on like King Farouk and his latest girlfriend.", 0.1706060606060606], "title":

What in fact will happen to me in 9 more years? That is like worrying about a cheese spoiling if you don\u2019t put it in the refrigerator. What can happen to a pricelessly stinky cheese that hasn\u2019t already happened to it?\nMY MOTHER-IN-LAW, NO danger to herself or anyone else, adored fishing. I had put a worm on her hook for her and pitched it out to a spot that looked promising. She gripped the rod with both hands, sure as always that something miraculous was about to happen.\nShe was right this time.\nI looked up at the top of the bank, and there was a prison truck with smoke pouring out of its engine compartment. There were only 2 guards on board, and 1 of them was the driver. They bailed out. They had already radioed the prison for help. They were both white. This was before the Japanese took over Athena as a business proposition, before the road signs all the way from Rochester were in both English and Japanese.\nIt looked as though the truck might catch fire, so the 2 guards unlocked the little door in the back of the steel box and told the prisoners to come out. And then they backed off and waited with sawed-off automatic shotguns leveled at the little door.\nOut the prisoners came. There were only 3 of them, clumsy in leg irons, and their handcuffs were shackled to chains around their waists. Two were black and 1 was white, or possibly a light Hispanic. This was before the Supreme Court confirmed that it was indeed cruel and inhuman punishment to confine a person in a place where his or her race was greatly outnumbered by another 1.\nThe races were still mixed in prisons throughout the country. When I later went to work at Athena, though, there was nothing but people who had been classified as Black in there.\nMY MOTHER-IN-LAW DID not turn around to see the smoking van and all. She was obsessed by what might happen at any moment at the other end of her fishline. But Margaret and I gawked. For us back then, prisoners were like pornography, common things nice people shouldn\u2019t want to see, even though the biggest industry by far in this valley was punishment.\nWhen Margaret and I talked about it later, she didn\u2019t say it was like pornography. She said it was like seeing animals on their way to a slaughterhouse.\nWE, IN TURN, must have looked to those convicts like people in Paradise. It was a balmy day in the springtime. A sailboat race was going on to the south of us.

They were small, but they were numerous and volatile. They wished to become frightening, in order to defend themselves and their friends and families, something the police wouldn\u2019t do. They also wanted to drive the drug peddlers out of the neighborhood, and to get enough publicity, which was very important, to catch the attention of the Government, so that the Government would do a better job of picking up the garbage and so on.\nOne of them, Jos\u00e9 Mendoza, was a fairly good painter. So he painted the emblem of their new gang on the backs of the members\u2019 jackets. This was it:\n9\nWHILE KILGORE TROUT was inadvertently poisoning the collective mind of New York City, Dwayne Hoover, the demented Pontiac dealer, was coming down from the roof of his own Holiday Inn in the Middle West.\nDwayne went into the carpeted lobby of the place not long before sunrise, to ask for a room. As queer as the hour was, there was a man ahead of him, and a black one at that. This was Cyprian Ukwende, the Indaro, the physician from Nigeria, who was staying at the Inn until he could find a suitable apartment.\nDwayne awaited his turn humbly. He had forgotten that he was a co-owner of the Inn. As for staying at a place where black men stayed, Dwayne was philosophical. He experienced a sort of bittersweet happiness as he told himself, \u201cTimes change. Times change.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe night clerk was new. He did not know Dwayne. He had Dwayne fill out a registration in full. Dwayne, for his part, apologized for not knowing what the number of his license plate was. He felt guilty about that, even though he knew he had done nothing he should feel guilty about.\nHe was elated when the clerk let him have a room key. He had passed the test. And he adored his room. It was so new and cool and clean. It was so neutral! It was the brother of thousands upon thousands of rooms in Holiday Inns all over the world.\nDwayne Hoover might be confused as to what his life was all about, or what he should do with it next. But this much he has done correctly: He had delivered himself to an irreproachable container for a human being.", 0.12047831253713606], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["coleman", 0.049586776859504134], ["kniptash", 0.04132231404958678], ["donnini", 0.03305785123966942], ["cake", 0.03305785123966942], ["lady", 0.024793388429752067], ["top", 0.024793388429752067], ["draw", 0.024793388429752067], ["kleinhans", 0.01652892561983471], ["twelve", 0.01652892561983471], ["baltimore", 0.01652892561983471], ["head", 0.01652892561983471], ["notebook", 0.01652892561983471], ["flourish", 0.01652892561983471], ["stack", 0.01652892561983471], ["mmmmmmmm", 0.008264462809917356], ["cried", 0.008264462809917356], ["held", 0.008264462809917356], ["hell", 0.008264462809917356], ["rough", 0.008264462809917356], ["fine", 0.008264462809917356], ["notebooks", 0.008264462809917356], ["cherries", 0.008264462809917356], ["pretty", 0.008264462809917356], ["breathing", 0.008264462809917356], ["icing", 0.008264462809917356], ["straightforwardly", 0.008264462809917356], ["pocket", 0.008264462809917356], ["lunch", 0.008264462809917356], ["bastards", 0.008264462809917356], ["breast", 0.008264462809917356], ["obligingly", 0.008264462809917356], ["success", 0.008264462809917356], ["fluttered", 0.008264462809917356], ["licking", 0.008264462809917356], ["shaking", 0.008264462809917356], ["strode", 0.008264462809917356], ["em", 0.008264462809917356], ["fantastically", 0.008264462809917356], ["jump", 0.008264462809917356], ["lips", 0.008264462809917356], ["books", 0.008264462809917356], ["snatched", 0.008264462809917356], ["sketched", 0.008264462809917356], ["arm", 0.008264462809917356], ["opened", 0.008264462809917356], ["pictures", 0.008264462809917356], ["bird", 0.008264462809917356], ["pancakes", 0.008264462809917356], ["met", 0.008264462809917356], ["boy", 0.008264462809917356], ["ach", 0.008264462809917356], ["urged", 0.008264462809917356], ["length", 0.008264462809917356], ["cakes", 0.008264462809917356], ["headed", 0.008264462809917356], ["bayonet", 0.008264462809917356], ["private", 0.008264462809917356], ["blows", 0.008264462809917356], ["tangle", 0.008264462809917356], ["corporal", 0.008264462809917356], ["script", 0.008264462809917356], ["long", 0.008264462809917356], ["breath", 0.008264462809917356], ["los", 0.008264462809917356], ["going", 0.008264462809917356], ["stuffed", 0.008264462809917356], ["white", 0.008264462809917356], ["door", 0.008264462809917356], ["happily", 0.008264462809917356], ["understand", 0.008264462809917356], ["rifle", 0.008264462809917356], ["hour", 0.008264462809917356], ["work", 0.008264462809917356], ["shook", 0.008264462809917356], ["mensch", 0.008264462809917356], ["mine", 0.008264462809917356], ["nazi", 0.008264462809917356], ["pink", 0.008264462809917356], ["disapprovingly", 0.008264462809917356], ["began", 0.008264462809917356], ["eagerly", 0.008264462809917356], ["holding", 0.008264462809917356], ["fudge", 0.008264462809917356], ["composition", 0.008264462809917356], ["picture", 0.008264462809917356], ["complained", 0.008264462809917356], ["fastened", 0.008264462809917356], ["neck", 0.008264462809917356], ["practically", 0.008264462809917356], ["heartening", 0.008264462809917356], ["admiringly", 0.008264462809917356], ["wounded", 0.008264462809917356], ["wreckage", 0.008264462809917356]], "sentiment": ["\u201cMmmmmmmm,\u201d said Coleman, shaking his head and licking his lips.\n\u201cBoy!\u201d said Kniptash admiringly. \u201cThe little bastards practically jump out at you, don\u2019t they!\u201d\nColeman held out his notebook eagerly.
