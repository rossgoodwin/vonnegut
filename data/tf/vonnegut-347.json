Not that it would have pained Paul to talk about them, but because they were extraordinarily difficult to describe. His own motivation was obscure, the cast was unwieldy, and, Paul realized, the denouement was still to come. Through all his adventures, he had been a derelict, tossed this way, then that. He had yet to lay a firm hand on the tiller.\nThe managers and engineers still believed he was their man; the Ghost Shirt Society was just as convinced that he belonged to them, and both had demonstrated that there was no middle ground for him.\nWhen the police had identified Paul, they had been embarrassed by his I.Q., and his rank in the criminal hierarchy: the archcriminal, the would-be king of the saboteurs. There was no comparable rank in the Ilium police force, and the police had, out of humbleness and lifelong indoctrination, sent for inquisitors with adequate classification numbers and I.Q.\u2019s.\nMeanwhile, Paul and Harold passed the time of day.\n\u201cAin\u2019 a bit sorry,\u201d said Harold. \u201cWha\u2019s \u2019at tap-tap-tappin\u2019?\u201d\nThe irregular tapping came from

forms than the novel, but he also found a way to spend more time with the artistic endeavors he enjoyed, making silk-screen prints of his drawings. An invitation to speak in Lexington, Kentucky, by an old friend from his days working for General Electric started the ball rolling. Ollie Lyon, who had worked as a fellow publicist with Kurt back in the forties in Schenectady, New York, had become chair of the Midway College (Kentucky) Development Fund and invited his old friend to speak at a fund-raiser. He got Joe Petro III, a local printmaker, to design a poster for the event using Vonnegut\u2019s drawing of himself with a tear falling from his eye, which adorned the \u201cAbout the Author\u201d page of Breakfast of Champions. This began a partnership between Petro and the author that Vonnegut described in Timequake:\n\u201cI myself paint pictures on sheets of acetate with black India ink. An artist half my age, Joe Petro III, who lives and works in Lexington, Kentucky, prints them by means of the silk-screen process.\u2026 There may be easier, quicker, and cheaper ways to create pictures. They might leave us more time for golf, and for making model airplanes and whacking off. We should look into that. Joe\u2019s studio looks like something out of the Middle Ages.\u2026 I can\u2019t thank Joe enough for having me make negatives for his positives after the little radio in my head stopped receiving messages from wherever it is the bright ideas come from. Art is so absorbing. It is a sopper-upper.\u201d\nIn 1996, Vonnegut\u2019s Mother Night was made into what Kurt gratefully felt was \u201ca swell movie\u201d by Robert Weide, starring Nick Nolte. First published as a paperback original in 1962 for $3,000, that novel had not been reviewed at the time.\nSo it goes.\nJanuary 3, 1990\nNew York City\nTO JEROME KLINKOWITZ\nThe \u201cTwayne\u201d book was Slaughterhouse-Five: Reforming the Novel and the World by Jerome Klinkowitz, published by Twayne\u2019s Masterwork Studies. Vonnegut had dedicated Slaughterhouse-Five to Mary O\u2019Hare, the wife of Kurt\u2019s war buddy Bernard V. O\u2019Hare. Granville Hicks was a literary critic, whose books include The Great Tradition: An Interpretation of American Literature Since the Civil War.\nDear Jerry\u2014\nIf Twayne sent me the hardcover, it got lost in the Christmas pandemonium. The softcover will do. I thank you for taking my work so seriously. I have just written a preface to a novel I\u2019m finishing in which I object to the school of criticism which treats authors as idiot savants. But I have to admit, after reading about all I managed to put into Slaughterhouse-5, that I really was flying by the seat of my pants and was lucky as hell. The biggest break, I think, was Mary O\u2019Hare.

instantly fell silent.\nThe living room of the Schwartz apartment darkened for a moment, as the riot scenes faded, and then the face of the announcer appeared, like the sun coming from behind a cloud. \"And now, friends,\" he said, \"I have a special message from the makers of anti-gerasone, a message for all you folks over one hundred and fifty. Are you hampered socially by wrinkles, by stiffness of joints and discoloration or loss of hair, all because these things came upon you before anti-gerasone was developed? Well, if you are, you need no longer suffer, need no longer feel different and out of things.\n\"After years of research, medical science has now developed super-anti-gerosone! In weeks, yes weeks, you can look, feel, and act as young as your great-great-grandchildren! Wouldn\u2019t you pay $5,000 to be indistinguishable from everybody else? Well, you don\u2019t have to. Safe, tested super-anti-gerasone costs you only dollars a day. The average cost of regaining all the sparkle and attractiveness of youth is less than fifty dollars.\n\"Write now for your free trial carton. Just put your name and address on a dollar postcard, and mail it to \u2019Super,\u2019 Box 500,000, Schenectady, N.Y. Have you got that? I\u2019ll repeat it. \u2019Super.\u2019 Box...\" Underlining the announcer\u2019s words was the scratching of Gramps\u2019 fountain-pen, the one Willy had given him the night before. He had come in a few minutes previous from the Idle Hour Tavern, which commanded a view of Building 257 across the square of asphalt known as the Alden Village Green. He had called a cleaning woman to come straighten the place up, and had hired the best lawyer in town to get his descendants a conviction. Gramps had then moved the daybed before the television screen so that he could watch from a reclining position. It was something he\u2019d dreamed of doing for years.\n\"Schen-ec-ta-dy,\" mouthed Gramps: \"Got it.\" His face had changed remarkably. His facial muscles seemed to have relaxed, revealing kindness and equanimity under what had been taut, bad-tempered lines. It was almost as though his trial package of Super-anti-gerasone had already arrived. When something amused him on television, he smiled easily, rather than barely managing to lengthen the thin line of his mouth a millimeter. Life was good. He could hardly wait to see what was going to happen next.\n(1953)\nDELL BOOKS BY KURT VONNEGUT\nBluebeard\nBreakfast of Champions\nCat\u2019s Cradle", 0.11424319727891157], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
