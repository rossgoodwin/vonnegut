It has now been cut by a third. Unbelievably, it was made for five and a half million dollars! Nolte himself usually gets paid much more than that. When he saw Weide\u2019s script, he said it reminded him of why he became an actor. I have bought back The Sirens of Titan from Jerry Garcia\u2019s estate for what he paid me for it decades ago. Weide would like to do a script for that next. With no studio involvement, he and I can make it, as we did with Mother Night, exactly what we feel it should be. And then we captivate another important actor. That\u2019s when we go to a studio for money only and no advice.\nAs for still pictures: I am trying to recover the cost of frames, and Joe must have spent a small fortune on what he does. People have trouble understanding that they are rarities, made with great pains one at a time. They think we are putting high prices on posters run off in unlimited quantities by a printing press. Joe now has about ten more acetates I\u2019ve done, but which have yet to be printed. I have stopped making more until we can somehow start feeling like we are a business. A number of our prints will be hung in the cafe of a Barnes and Noble superstore in the Citicorp Building in February. Barnes and Noble will not be selling them, or trying to, since they don\u2019t handle items that expensive. Interested collectors, if any, will be referred to the Margo Feiden Gallery, where I had a one man show years and years ago. [\u2026]", 0.15752121212121215], "title": "Letters"}}
