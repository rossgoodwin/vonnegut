It has everything to do with the absorbing adventure of writing for and editing The Cornell Daily Sun, a quite separate corporation.\nMy colleagues on the Sun were almost all liberal arts majors of one sort or another, a few of them still close friends of mine, and they passed on to me in conversations what they themselves had learned about writing and history and literature.\nAdvice? Somebody should have told me not to join a fraternity, but to hang out with the independents, who were not then numerous. I would have grown up faster that way. Somebody should have told me that getting drunk, while fashionable, was dangerous and stupid. And somebody should have told me to forget about higher education, and to go to work for a newspaper instead. That is what a lot of the most promising and determined young writers used to do back then. Nowadays, of course, you can\u2019t get a job on a newspaper if you don\u2019t have a college education. Too bad.\nMy experiences at Cornell were freakish in the extreme, as have been most of those which followed, mostly accidents. So the advice I give myself at the age of 71 is the best advice I could have given myself in 1940, when detraining for the first time at Ithaca, having come all the way from Indianapolis: \u201cKeep your hat on.
