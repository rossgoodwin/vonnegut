laughed. \"In my na\u00efve, idealistic youth, Potter, I sold ads to feed stores, gathered gossip, set type, and wrote editorials that were going to save the world, by God.\"\nDavid smiled admiringly. \"What a circus, eh?\"\n\"Circus?\" said Flammer. \"Freak show, maybe. It\u2019s a good way to grow up fast. Took me about six months to find out I was killing myself for peanuts, that a little guy couldn\u2019t even save a village three blocks long, and that the world wasn\u2019t worth saving anyway. So I started looking out for Number One. Sold out to a chain, came down here, and here I am.\"\nThe telephone rang. \"Yes?\" said Flammer sweetly. \"Puhbliss-itee.\" His benign smile faded. \"No. You\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you? Where? Really\u2014this is no gag? All right, all right. Lord! What a time for this to happen. I haven\u2019t got anybody here, and I can\u2019t get away on account of the goddam boy scouts.\" He hung up. \"Potter\u2014you\u2019ve got your first assignment. There\u2019s a deer loose in the Works!\"\n\"Deer?\"\n\"Don\u2019t know how he got in, but he\u2019s in. Plumber went to fix a drinking fountain out at the softball diamond across from Building 217, and flushed a deer out from under the bleachers. Now they got him cornered up around the metallurgy lab.\" He stood and hammered on his desk. \"Murder! The story will go all over the country, Potter. Talk about human interest. Front page! Of all the times for Al Tappin to be out at the Ashtabula Works, taking pictures of a new viscometer they cooked up out there! All right\u2014I\u2019ll call up a hack photographer downtown, Potter, and get him to meet you out by the metallurgy lab. You get the story and see that he gets the right shots. Okay?\"\nHe led David into the hallway. \"Just go back the way you came, turn left instead of right at fractional horsepower motors, cut through hydraulic engineering, catch bus eleven on Avenue 9, and it\u2019ll take you right there. After you get the story and pictures, we\u2019ll get them cleared by the law division, the plant security officer, our department head and buildings and grounds, and shoot them right out. Now get going. That deer isn\u2019t on the payroll\u2014he isn\u2019t going to wait for you. Come to work today\u2014tomorrow your work will be on every front page in the country, if we can get it approved. The name of the photographer you\u2019re going to meet is McGarvey. Got it? You\u2019re in the big time now, Potter. We\u2019ll all be watching.\" He shut the door behind David.\nDavid found himself trotting down the hall, down a stairway, and into an alley, brushing roughly past persons in a race against time. Many turned to watch the purposeful young man with admiration.\nOn and on he strode, his mind seething with information: Flammer, Building 31; deer, metallurgy lab; photographer, Al Tappin. No. Al Tappin in Ashtabula. Flenny the hack photographer. No. McCammer. No. McCammer is new supervisor. Fifty-six per cent eagle scouts. Deer by viscometer laboratory. No. Viscometer in Ashtabula. Call Danner, new supervisor, and get instructions right. Three weeks\u2019 vacation after fifteen years. Danner not new supervisor. Anyway, new supervisor in Building 319. No. Fanner in Building 39981983319.\nDavid stopped, blocked by a grimy window at the end of a blind alley. All he knew was that he\u2019d never been there before, that his memory had blown a gasket, and that the deer was not on the payroll. The air in the alley was thick with tango music and the stench of scorched insulation. David scrubbed away some of the crust on the window with his handkerchief, praying for a glimpse of something that made sense.", 0.1299576549576549], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["dr", 0.07608695652173914], ["abekian", 0.07608695652173914], ["barbara", 0.05434782608695652], ["doctor", 0.043478260869565216], ["door", 0.03260869565217391], ["joe", 0.03260869565217391], ["wife", 0.03260869565217391], ["office", 0.021739130434782608], ["thinks", 0.021739130434782608], ["opened", 0.021739130434782608], ["closed", 0.021739130434782608], ["cunningham", 0.021739130434782608], ["honest", 0.021739130434782608], ["husband", 0.021739130434782608], ["raised", 0.010869565217391304], ["brunette", 0.010869565217391304], ["help", 0.010869565217391304], ["harassed", 0.010869565217391304], ["student", 0.010869565217391304], ["house", 0.010869565217391304], ["lips", 0.010869565217391304], ["fast", 0.010869565217391304], ["ready", 0.010869565217391304], ["patient", 0.010869565217391304], ["shrugged", 0.010869565217391304], ["best", 0.010869565217391304], ["honesty", 0.010869565217391304], ["sterile", 0.010869565217391304], ["glistening", 0.010869565217391304], ["nodded", 0.010869565217391304], ["botched", 0.010869565217391304], ["arms", 0.010869565217391304], ["trinket", 0.010869565217391304], ["better", 0.010869565217391304], ["waiting", 0.010869565217391304], ["crying", 0.010869565217391304], ["nurse", 0.010869565217391304], ["mock", 0.010869565217391304], ["wouldn", 0.010869565217391304], ["eyes", 0.010869565217391304], ["woman", 0.010869565217391304], ["job", 0.010869565217391304], ["great", 0.010869565217391304], ["tautly", 0.010869565217391304], ["finished", 0.010869565217391304], ["understand", 0.010869565217391304], ["curiosity", 0.010869565217391304], ["baby", 0.010869565217391304], ["arranged", 0.010869565217391304], ["faster", 0.010869565217391304], ["admiration", 0.010869565217391304], ["weakly", 0.010869565217391304], ["room", 0.010869565217391304], ["pregnant", 0.010869565217391304], ["abortion", 0.010869565217391304], ["completely", 0.010869565217391304], ["walked", 0.010869565217391304], ["licked", 0.010869565217391304], ["achieve", 0.010869565217391304], ["strode", 0.010869565217391304]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThe doctor is in,\u201d said Dr. Abekian.
