spoken there. His parents raised him \u201cwithout acquainting me with the language or the literature or the oral family histories which my ancestors had loved,\u201d he wrote in Palm Sunday. \u201cThey volunteered to make me ignorant and rootless as proof of their patriotism.\u201d\nIn his Athenaeum speech, Kurt said, \u201cDuring the Second World War, there was a saying in my family and others that the only thing wrong with Germans was that they were in Germany. I say now that everything there is to admire in German culture, the poetry, the music, the architecture, the etchings, the beers, the wines, the sentimentality about Christmas, the work ethic, came from several Germanies. Everything I loathe about it came from one.\u201d He meant, of course, Nazi Germany, which he told the American Psychiatric Association in 1988, \u201cgave us a nightmare from which, in my opinion, there can never be an awakening.\u201d\nThe family fortune made from the hardware business, as well as his grandfather and father\u2019s successful architecture company, enabled Kurt\u2019s parents to enjoy a lavish lifestyle and send their children to the socially elite private schools of the city, the Orchard School for boys and Tudor Hall for girls. But when the Great Depression hit, almost all building stopped, and Kurt, Sr., was forced to close his office. Kurt was taken out of private school and sent to Public School No. 43, which his mother, Edith, who was from one of the grand and wealthy German families of the city (the Leibers), regarded as a tragedy. She assured him that when the Depression ended he would resume his proper place in society, playing tennis and golf at the Woodstock Country Club and enjoying the privileges of the elite. Young Kurt saw it another way, as he explained in Palm Sunday:\n\u201cWe were at least as well off as most of the people I went to public school with, and I would have lost all my friends if we had started having servants again, and worn expensive clothes again, and ridden on ocean liners and visited German relatives in a real castle, and on and on.\u2026 [Mother] could not understand that to give up my friends at Public School No. 43 would be for me to give up everything.\u201d\nKurt always said he was lucky to have been born in Indianapolis. \u201cThat city gave me a free primary and secondary education richer and more humane than anything I would get from any of the five universities I attended [Cornell, Butler, Carnegie Tech, Tennessee, and Chicago].\u201d\nI felt the same way, which was one of many bonds I was fortunate to share with Kurt Vonnegut. Another bond\u2014the one that originally launched our lifelong friendship\u2014was our mutual ineptitude at sports. I had read all four novels he\u2019d published when we met for the first time in 1963 at a friend\u2019s house in Cambridge, Massachusetts, when Vonnegut was living on Cape Cod. There were eight people at the dinner, so I was only able to exchange a few jokey comments about high school with Kurt, but I liked him at once. He was a tall, thin, tousle-haired man with a shaggy mustache and a kindly Midwestern demeanor. His offbeat sense of humor and his openness, his friendliness to everyone there, made me feel I knew and could trust him and gave me the courage to send him a book I wrote the next year, called Between the Lines, which combined journalistic articles with personal commentary. In the book I confessed that my dreams of athletic glory in high school were shattered by my inability to break the seven-minute mile\u2014a time I imagined a well-conditioned grandmother might have equaled. Kurt wrote me back a warm, funny letter, confessing that he, too, had been unable to break the seven-minute mile in high school and that we had so many of the same teachers and experiences, \u201cI almost feel that there shouldn\u2019t be two of us.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t realize till years later how deeply Kurt\u2019s \u201cnonathletic\u201d experience in high school had affected him. When he\u2019d finally gained fame and fortune after years of struggle and moved to New York, he was sitting up late one night by himself, drinking bourbon, and called Indianapolis information, asking if they had a listing for the man who\u2019d been the football coach at Shortridge High when he was there. Kurt said that in his era there had been a tradition of faculty members giving \u201cjoke presents\u201d to well-known seniors at a gathering of the class. He told me he had been \u201ca tall, skinny, gangly kind of kid\u201d in high school, and the coach had \u201cawarded\u201d him a subscription to the \u201cCharles Atlas Bodybuilding Course.\u201d The course was famous for its ads showing how a ninety-pound \u201cweakling\u201d could become a muscular hero. It had hurt and embarrassed him, and it still rankled, even after all his success. He told me that when he got the coach on the phone all those years later, he said, \u201cMy name is Kurt Vonnegut\u2014you probably don\u2019t remember me, but I wanted to tell you my body turned out just fine.\u201d\nI thought no more about it until I read, in his introduction to a collection of his stories called Bagombo Snuff Box, a reminiscence of coming home from high school one afternoon and sitting down to read a short story in The Saturday Evening Post. He began: \u201cIt is raining outside, and I am unpopular.\u201d I knew from reading his high school yearbook that Kurt had been president of the Social Committee, which sponsored dances and parties, co-chairman with his best friend, Ben Hitz, of a \u201chilarious comedy act\u201d in the prestigious Junior Vaudeville, a member of the Student Council, an editor of the Daily Echo, and, most impressively to anyone who went to Shortridge, he was one of the ten senior boys nominated for \u201cUglyman\u201d\u2014which did not mean the ugliest but the most-popular boys. Along with the ten most-popular girls, nominated for \u201cBluebelle,\u201d these twenty were voted on by the entire student body as the pinnacle of high school popularity.\nKurt\u2019s friend from high school Victor Jose, a fellow member of the Owls Club (one of the many social clubs that were not sponsored by the faculty but flourished at Shortridge in my time and theirs), also worked with him on the Daily Echo, and after their service in World War II, they worked together in the Chicago News Bureau in 1947, remaining friends and corresponding off and on throughout their lives. When I asked Vic Jose how Kurt could have felt himself \u201cunpopular\u201d after all his high school kudos and accomplishments, he said he felt it must have related to \u201cKurt\u2019s adversarial relationship with the so-called sports heroes of our time.\u2026\u201d\nKurt poked fun at the sports gods, \u201cprobably in his writing, probably in the Echo,\u201d Jose recalled. \u201cAnyway, there was bad blood there, and, in retaliation, some of the jocks caught Kurt in some unobserved location, picked him up, and stuffed him in a trash can somewhere in the [school] building. I know all this only secondhand, Kurt never told me, but it was common knowledge. It was no lighthearted joke but seemed to fester with time, because it surfaced at our fiftieth reunion.\u201d Two of the \u201cjocks\u201d of the class opposed having Vonnegut give the main speech at one of the fiftieth-reunion events\u2014but the rest of the organizing committee insisted on having him as the headliner.

Somewhere in Germany is a stream called the Vonne. That is the source of my curious name.\nI have been a writer since 1949. I am self-taught. I have no theories about writing that might help others. When I write I simply become what I seemingly must become. I am six feet two and weigh nearly two hundred pounds and am badly coordinated, except when I swim. All that borrowed meat does the writing.\nIn the water I am beautiful.\nMy father and paternal grandfather were architects in Indianapolis, Indiana, where I was born. My maternal grandfather owned a brewery there. He won a Gold Medal at the Paris Exposition with his beer, which was Lieber Lager. The secret ingredient was coffee.\nMy only brother, eight years older than I, is a successful scientist. His special field is physics as it relates to clouds. His name is Bernard, and he is funnier than I am. I remember a letter he wrote after his first child, Peter, was born and brought home. \"Here I am,\" that letter began, \"cleaning shit off of practically everything.\"\nMy only sister, five years older than I, died when she was forty. She was over six feet tall, too, by an angstrom unit or so. She was heavenly to look at, and graceful, both in and out of water. She was a sculptress. She was christened \"Alice,\" but she used to deny that she was really an Alice. I agreed. Everybody agreed. Sometime in a dream maybe I will find out what her real name was.", 0.1208863066757804], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["campbell", 0.029850746268656716], ["confessions", 0.022388059701492536], ["playwright", 0.014925373134328358], ["writer", 0.014925373134328358], ["moral", 0.014925373134328358], ["editor", 0.014925373134328358], ["dead", 0.014925373134328358], ["sense", 0.014925373134328358], ["lie", 0.014925373134328358], ["writings", 0.007462686567164179], ["liar", 0.007462686567164179], ["german", 0.007462686567164179], ["higher", 0.007462686567164179], ["135", 0.007462686567164179], ["style", 0.007462686567164179], ["death", 0.007462686567164179], ["deceiving", 0.007462686567164179], ["interesting", 0.007462686567164179], ["concerned", 0.007462686567164179], ["better", 0.007462686567164179], ["virtuous", 0.007462686567164179], ["good", 0.007462686567164179], ["iowa", 0.007462686567164179], ["risk", 0.007462686567164179], ["demands", 0.007462686567164179], ["hansels", 0.007462686567164179], ["watch", 0.007462686567164179], ["miners", 0.007462686567164179], ["preparing", 0.007462686567164179], ["bringing", 0.007462686567164179], ["dig", 0.007462686567164179], ["truth", 0.007462686567164179], ["simply", 0.007462686567164179], ["grotesquely", 0.007462686567164179], ["harm", 0.007462686567164179], ["art", 0.007462686567164179], ["jews", 0.007462686567164179], ["deal", 0.007462686567164179], ["crimes", 0.007462686567164179], ["boots", 0.007462686567164179], ["born", 0.007462686567164179], ["accused", 0.007462686567164179], ["pass", 0.007462686567164179], ["secretly", 0.007462686567164179], ["passions", 0.007462686567164179], ["corpse", 0.007462686567164179], ["factory", 0.007462686567164179], ["artificial", 0.007462686567164179], ["poles", 0.007462686567164179], ["reader", 0.007462686567164179], ["harsher", 0.007462686567164179], ["moderate", 0.007462686567164179], ["occurs", 0.007462686567164179], ["nazis", 0.007462686567164179], ["told", 0.007462686567164179], ["men", 0.007462686567164179], ["jr", 0.007462686567164179], ["stage", 0.007462686567164179], ["bopping", 0.007462686567164179], ["leaving", 0.007462686567164179], ["informing", 0.007462686567164179], ["american", 0.007462686567164179], ["forms", 0.007462686567164179], ["gingerbread", 0.007462686567164179], ["cellars", 0.007462686567164179], ["sticking", 0.007462686567164179], ["snowbanks", 0.007462686567164179], ["love", 0.007462686567164179], ["point", 0.007462686567164179], ["satisfactory", 0.007462686567164179], ["gypsies", 0.007462686567164179], ["lies", 0.007462686567164179], ["warped", 0.007462686567164179], ["mere", 0.007462686567164179], ["city", 0.007462686567164179], ["howard", 0.007462686567164179], ["sake", 0.007462686567164179], ["laps", 0.007462686567164179], ["insides", 0.007462686567164179], ["syrup", 0.007462686567164179], ["duties", 0.007462686567164179], ["offer", 0.007462686567164179], ["gretels", 0.007462686567164179], ["lives", 0.007462686567164179], ["shelters", 0.007462686567164179], ["case", 0.007462686567164179], ["edition", 0.007462686567164179], ["malt", 0.007462686567164179], ["work", 0.007462686567164179], ["will", 0.007462686567164179], ["suppose", 0.007462686567164179], ["care", 0.007462686567164179], ["beguiling", 0.007462686567164179], ["polemic", 0.007462686567164179], ["ages", 0.007462686567164179], ["warning", 0.007462686567164179], ["nazi", 0.007462686567164179], ["1966", 0.007462686567164179], ["breaking", 0.007462686567164179], ["note", 0.007462686567164179], ["instance", 0.007462686567164179], ["relatives", 0.007462686567164179], ["types", 0.007462686567164179], ["artistic", 0.007462686567164179], ["000", 0.007462686567164179], ["germany", 0.007462686567164179], ["opinion", 0.007462686567164179], ["extremely", 0.007462686567164179], ["warming", 0.007462686567164179], ["man", 0.007462686567164179], ["argue", 0.007462686567164179], ["theater", 0.007462686567164179], ["valuables", 0.007462686567164179], ["clear", 0.007462686567164179], ["tale", 0.007462686567164179], ["person", 0.007462686567164179], ["reputation", 0.007462686567164179], ["lying", 0.007462686567164179], ["time", 0.007462686567164179], ["serious", 0.007462686567164179], ["baked", 0.007462686567164179], ["bodies", 0.007462686567164179]], "sentiment": ["The malt syrup factory was gone. Everything was gone but the cellars where 135,000 Hansels and Gretels had been baked like gingerbread men. So we were put to work as corpse miners, breaking into shelters, bringing bodies out. And I got to see many German types of all ages as death had found them, usually with valuables in their laps. Sometimes relatives would come to watch us dig. They were interesting, too.\nSo much for Nazis and me.\nIf I\u2019d been born in Germany, I suppose I would have been a Nazi, bopping Jews and gypsies and Poles around, leaving boots sticking out of snowbanks, warming myself with my secretly virtuous insides. So it goes.\nThere\u2019s another clear moral to this tale, now that I think about it: When you\u2019re dead you\u2019re dead.\nAnd yet another moral occurs to me now: Make love when you can. It\u2019s good for you.\nIowa City, 1966\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE\nIN PREPARING THIS, the American edition of the confessions of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., I have had to deal with writings concerned with more than mere informing or deceiving, as the case may be. Campbell was a writer as well as a person accused of extremely serious crimes, a one-time playwright of moderate reputation. To say that he was a writer is to say that the demands of art alone were enough to make him lie, and to lie without seeing any harm in it. To say that he was a playwright is to offer an even harsher warning to the reader, for no one is a better liar than a man who has warped lives and passions onto something as grotesquely artificial as a stage.\nAnd, now that I\u2019ve said that about lying, I will risk the opinion that lies told for the sake of artistic effect\u2014in the theater, for instance, and in Campbell\u2019s confessions, perhaps\u2014can be, in a higher sense, the most beguiling forms of truth.\nI don\u2019t care to argue the point.

botched anesthesia during a triple bypass. I had listened to several people on TV talk shows who had gone down the blue tunnel to the Pearly Gates, and even beyond the Pearly Gates, or so they said, and then come back to life again. But I certainly wouldn\u2019t have set out on such a risky expedition on purpose, without first having survived one, and then planned another in cooperation with Dr. Jack Kevorkian and the staff at the state-of-the-art lethal injection execution facility at Huntsville, Texas.\nThe following reports were recorded for later broadcast by radio station WNYC. I hope they convey a sense of immediacy. They were taped in the tiled Huntsville death chamber only five minutes or so after I was unstrapped from the gurney. The tape recorder, incidentally, like the gurney, was the property of the good people of Texas, and was ordinarily used to immortalize the last words of persons about to make a one-way, all-expenses-paid trip to Paradise.\nThere will be no more round trips for me, barring another accident. For the sake of my family, I am trying to reinstate my health and life insurance polices, if possible. But other journalists, and perhaps even tourists, will surely follow the safe two-way path to Eternity I pioneered. I beg them to be content, as I learned to be, with interviews they are able to conduct on the hundred yards or so of vacant lot between the far end of the blue tunnel and the Pearly Gates.\nTo go through the Pearly Gates, no matter how tempting the interviewee on the other side, as I myself discovered the hard way, is to run the risk that crotchety Saint Peter, depending on his mood, may never let you out again. Think of how heartbroken your friends and relatives would be if, by going through the Pearly Gates to talk to Napoleon, say, you in effect committed suicide.\nAbout belief or lack of belief in an afterlife: Some of you may know that I am neither Christian nor Jewish nor Buddhist, nor a conventionally religious person of any sort.\nI am a humanist, which means, in part, that I have tried to behave decently without any expectation of rewards or punishments after I\u2019m dead. My German-American ancestors, the earliest of whom settled in our Middle West about the time of our Civil War, called themselves \u201cFreethinkers,\u201d which is the same sort of thing. My great grandfather Clemens Vonnegut wrote, for example, \u201cIf what Jesus said was good, what can it matter whether he was God or not?\u201d\nI myself have written, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the message of mercy and pity in Jesus\u2019 Sermon on the Mount, I wouldn\u2019t want to be a human being. I would just as soon be a rattlesnake.\u201d\nI am honorary president of the American Humanist Association, having succeeded the late, great, spectacularly prolific writer and scientist, Dr. Isaac Asimov in that essentially functionless capacity.

Nobody ever had a better daddy than we do.\u201d She nodded twice in affirmation of her statement.\n\u201cI would like to hang a picture over my bed,\u201d said Haley. \u201cWould it hurt anything if I drove a nail in the wall?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I guess it would be all right, if you\u2019d be very careful not to crack the plaster. But that\u2019s for the General to say, of course,\u201d said Annie. \u201cYou can ask him when you meet him at suppertime. He ought to be in a pretty good mood, because he figures he\u2019s got Caesar and Delores licked.\u201d\n\u201cMore cousins?\u201d Haley asked abstractedly. He was examining a framed photograph, which had been swathed in a pair of flannel pajamas in the heart of his suitcase.\nAnnie chuckled appreciatively. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll think they look like cousins when you see them tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cCaesar and Delores are the horses who pull the wagon. They ran away with a load last week, and they tore up the vegetable garden before they finally came up against a fence. The General\u2019s out today, trying some new bits that look like bicycle chains with sawteeth along one edge. He says if those two get fancy with him again, he\u2019ll saw their heads off before they can run ten yards.\u201d She seemed to relish the picture. \u201cThat\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t here to welcome you this afternoon,\u201d Annie explained. \u201cHe\u2019s out driving the team himself to make sure they know who\u2019s boss now. Ordinarily, he only goes out and works on D-days.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know about D-days,\u201d said Haley politely.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I explain all about that? Well, you would have seen all about it on the bulletin board anyway. Tuesdays and Thursdays are D-days, which means that everybody, including Kitty, Hope, and the General, has to go out and work a full day on the farm. Won\u2019t make much difference to you, I guess. I understand you\u2019re going to be working a full week. The only difference on D-days will be that you\u2019ll be on D-squad instead of C-squad. D-squad is the General, the two girls, you, and Mr. Banghart. Mr. Banghart is nuts. C-squad is you and Mr. Banghart.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d\n\u201cA- and B-squads are a couple of other crews.

Haley fidgeted under her warm, albeit vacant, gaze. Her face had much of the simple-naturedness of Annie\u2019s, but the setting of this attribute was altogether enchanting, he thought. One year his senior, she was fully a woman, whose lush maturity made Haley feel very young and frail indeed.\nHis awe must have shown, for Kitty crooned, \u201cAw, look at him, Annie. What\u2019s the matter, youngster? Afraid of girls, or don\u2019t you like it out here in God\u2019s country?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll like it very much,\u201d stammered Haley. \u201cMy mother used to tell me about when she was a little girl out here, and I got to feel it was kind of a second home of mine, too.\u201d\n\u201cBut what a come-down from New York, I\u2019ll bet \u2014 nightclubs, theaters, fancy stores, and everything.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s crazy to hear about New York,\u201d said Annie. \u201cFour million men in New York.\u201d\n\u201cIt was very different, certainly,\u201d said Haley, thoughtfully. \u201cWe always lived in apartments, and there were a lot of interesting people around all the time. Father loved it, naturally. It was the only kind of life for him.

It looked a lot like Dayton, Ohio, more open spaces than Dayton has. There must be tons of human bone meal in the ground.\nI went back there with an old war buddy, Bernard V. O\u2019Hare, and we made friends with a cab driver, who took us to the slaughterhouse where we had been locked up at night as prisoners of war. His name was Gerhard M\u00fcller. He told us that he was a prisoner of the Americans for a while. We asked him how it was to live under Communism, and he said that it was terrible at first, because everybody had to work so hard, and because there wasn\u2019t much shelter or food or clothing. But things were much better now. He had a pleasant little apartment, and his daughter was getting an excellent education. His mother was incinerated in the Dresden fire-storm. So it goes.\nHe sent O\u2019Hare a postcard at Christmastime, and here is what it said:\n\u201cI wish you and your family also as to your friend Merry Christmas and a happy New Year and I hope that we\u2019ll meet again in a world of peace and freedom in the taxi cab if the accident will.\u201d\nI like that very much: \u201cIf the accident will.\u201d\nI would hate to tell you what this lousy little book cost me in money and anxiety and time.

And I thought, too, that it would be a masterpiece or at least make me a lot of money, since the subject was so big.\nBut not many words about Dresden came from my mind then\u2014not enough of them to make a book, anyway. And not many words come now, either, when I have become an old fart with his memories and his Pall Malls, with his sons full grown.\nI think of how useless the Dresden part of my memory has been, and yet how tempting Dresden has been to write about, and I am reminded of the famous limerick:\nThere was a young man from Stamboul,\nWho soliloquized thus to his tool:", 0.06572390572390575], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["crowd", 0.04938271604938271], ["going", 0.037037037037037035], ["materialization", 0.037037037037037035], ["remained", 0.024691358024691357], ["nightmare", 0.024691358024691357], ["outwardness", 0.024691358024691357], ["private", 0.024691358024691357], ["man", 0.024691358024691357], ["dog", 0.024691358024691357], ["unexplored", 0.012345679012345678], ["affair", 0.012345679012345678], ["goodness", 0.012345679012345678], ["attractions", 0.012345679012345678], ["ages", 0.012345679012345678], ["souls", 0.012345679012345678], ["alive", 0.012345679012345678], ["roughly", 0.012345679012345678], ["second", 0.012345679012345678], ["substantial", 0.012345679012345678], ["agents", 0.012345679012345678], ["human", 0.012345679012345678], ["wasn", 0.012345679012345678], ["years", 0.012345679012345678], ["earth", 0.012345679012345678], ["air", 0.012345679012345678], ["pointless", 0.012345679012345678], ["depression", 0.012345679012345678], ["story", 0.012345679012345678], ["death", 0.012345679012345678], ["appear", 0.012345679012345678], ["space", 0.012345679012345678], ["bounties", 0.012345679012345678], ["people", 0.012345679012345678], ["three", 0.012345679012345678], ["unhappy", 0.012345679012345678], ["finally", 0.012345679012345678], ["low", 0.012345679012345678], ["falling", 0.012345679012345678], ["comedy", 0.012345679012345678], ["war", 0.012345679012345678], ["empty", 0.012345679012345678], ["emphatically", 0.012345679012345678], ["materialize", 0.012345679012345678], ["eyes", 0.012345679012345678], ["gathered", 0.012345679012345678], ["terra", 0.012345679012345678], ["strictly", 0.012345679012345678], ["explored", 0.012345679012345678], ["wispily", 0.012345679012345678], ["infinite", 0.012345679012345678], ["invited", 0.012345679012345678], ["wisdom", 0.012345679012345678], ["true", 0.012345679012345678], ["abundance", 0.012345679012345678], ["great", 0.012345679012345678], ["property", 0.012345679012345678], ["third", 0.012345679012345678], ["lost", 0.012345679012345678], ["meaninglessness", 0.012345679012345678], ["imagined", 0.012345679012345678], ["feast", 0.012345679012345678], ["soul", 0.012345679012345678], ["times", 0.012345679012345678], ["incognita", 0.012345679012345678], ["thin", 0.012345679012345678], ["olden", 0.012345679012345678], ["heroics", 0.012345679012345678], ["inwardness", 0.012345679012345678]], "sentiment": ["These unhappy agents found what had already been found in abundance on Earth\u2014a nightmare of meaninglessness without end.

It is a history of nothing but my own idiosyncratic responses to this or that.\nRabo Karabekian never lived, and neither did Terry Kitchen or Circe Berman or Paul Slazinger or Dan Gregory or Edith Taft or Marilee Kemp or any of the other major characters in this book.

0.0025188916876574307]], "sentiment": ["But precious few writers do so. We have collectively shrunk from any clear instructive point in our work. As a result, our short stories\u2014let\u2019s talk, here, about short stories primarily, given our present context\u2014are full of lovely sentences and nuance, but they are also lacking, too often, in punch.\nI will be the first to admit that I, too, have been trained to shy away from offering a tidy end, or moral point, to a story. Come to think of it, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever sent a simple declarative message in any short story. I came of age as a writer when to do so would have been out of the question. I was at least two generations removed from the days when a popular and literary short story would attempt to deliver a neat ending to a story, a conclusion that would cause the reader surprise and also recognition of a point made clearly and well.\nBut Vonnegut has always done so. And increasingly, what he did seems rare and necessary. Most of his short stories have resolutions that make abundantly clear that a lesson has been learned, by the characters (usually) and the reader (always).\nI\u2019ve been an avid reader of Vonnegut since I was a teenager, but it wasn\u2019t until I read these last two posthumous collections of stories, While Mortals Sleep and Look at the Birdie, that I\u2019ve realized just how strong a moralist Vonnegut was. I knew that as a man and as an essayist, he was not shy about making his opinions known. He spoke highly of Jesus Christ, and he made clear and simple pronouncements such as, \u201cGoddamn it, you\u2019ve got to be kind.\u201d And because he looked a bit like a hippie Mark Twain and appeared older than he was, he could carry it off. He seemed, even in early middle age, to be one of those elder statesmen who could declare his opinions, grumpily, about anything, and people would attach to these statements a certain gravitas\u2014well earned through his exemplary work and life. When you have fought in WWII, when you have survived Dresden, when you have supported your own family and also taken in the four orphaned children of your sister (after she and her husband died only days apart), then you\u2019ve got some credit in the moral-authority bank.\nAnd so we have these stories, which were written early in his career, when Vonnegut was trying to make a living as a writer. He was writing a great deal of short fiction at the time, and he was trying\u2014often successfully\u2014to sell these stories to magazines like Collier\u2019s and The Saturday Evening Post, which were then publishing a good deal of short fiction. Clearly, the way he wrote at the time was influenced a certain amount by what he knew these publications wanted. They wanted stories of relatively unadorned prose, tight plotting, simple conflict, and ideally an unexpected twist at the end.\nThese are what might be called mousetrap stories. This was once a popular, if not dominant, form. But you don\u2019t see it much anymore. We\u2019re now in the age of what might be called photorealistic stories. What we have with most contemporary short stories is a realism, a naturalism, that gives us roughly what photography gives us. A gifted photographer will frame reality in a way that seems both real and novel. His or her work will \u201chold a mirror\u201d to our lives, but in such a way that we see ourselves anew. All art forms attempt this mirror-holding, but photography, and the contemporary short story, are particularly well-designed delivery devices for this aim. And thus the contemporary short story gives us characters who breathe, who seem three-dimensional, who live in real places, who have real jobs and struggles and pain. The stories are to a great extent in service to these characters. The characters make realistic moves in their lives, realistic choices, and the outcomes are plausible and perhaps even pedestrian.\nNot as much so in a mousetrap story. A mousetrap story exists to trick or trap the reader. It moves the reader along, through the complex (but not too complex) machinery of the story, until the end, when the cage is sprung and the reader is trapped. And so in this kind of story, the characters, the setting, the plot\u2014they\u2019re all more or less means to an end.\nThis isn\u2019t to say the characters aren\u2019t real-seeming, aren\u2019t believable or sympathetic or any of the other things we might want characters to be. On the contrary, Vonnegut is masterful at quickly sketching a character who you instantly recognize and immediately are willing to follow. But in the end, their routes are determined by the master mousetrap maker, their fates in service to the larger point.\nAnd so, when you start a story in this collection, you know you are being set up. And you know what? It\u2019s fun to be set up. This collection is full of relatively simple stories, about relatively simple problems. In one story, a husband plays with his model trains too much, neglecting his wife in the process. (A far cry from Cat\u2019s Cradle.) In another, a newspaper editor who derides Christmas learns something about its true meaning when forced to judge a holiday lighting competition. A young woman inherits a fortune and finds the burden crushing and her new suitors untrustworthy. (Note just how many of these stories involve the pursuit of mid-century ideas of success\u2014a quick fortune, a stretch limo, nice dividends on a stock portfolio; Vonnegut, working as a PR man, was no doubt struggling to get over a financial hump himself.)\nIn any case, no matter what the plot, you as the reader know that by the end of the story, you will get somewhere. That Vonnegut will tell you something with candor and clarity. That being a decent person is an achievable and desirable thing. That faith has value. That wealth solves few problems. Simple enough messages, sure, but there\u2019s a reason to be reminded of such things, and relief in having them expressed artfully but with a certain lack of obfuscation.", 0.16626072412436044], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["love", 0.05660377358490566], ["good", 0.05660377358490566], ["faith", 0.05660377358490566], ["hardy", 0.03773584905660377], ["laurel", 0.03773584905660377], ["test", 0.03773584905660377], ["life", 0.03773584905660377], ["limited", 0.018867924528301886], ["intelligence", 0.018867924528301886], ["agility", 0.018867924528301886], ["find", 0.018867924528301886], ["best", 0.018867924528301886], ["comical", 0.018867924528301886], ["funny", 0.018867924528301886], ["issue", 0.018867924528301886], ["destiny", 0.018867924528301886], ["perpetually", 0.018867924528301886], ["poetry", 0.018867924528301886], ["instructed", 0.018867924528301886], ["failed", 0.018867924528301886], ["tests", 0.018867924528301886], ["depression", 0.018867924528301886], ["situational", 0.018867924528301886], ["adorable", 0.018867924528301886], ["provided", 0.018867924528301886], ["screamingly", 0.018867924528301886], ["great", 0.018867924528301886], ["films", 0.018867924528301886], ["feels", 0.018867924528301886], ["discuss", 0.018867924528301886], ["mentioning", 0.018867924528301886], ["account", 0.018867924528301886], ["destinies", 0.018867924528301886], ["natural", 0.018867924528301886], ["bargaining", 0.018867924528301886], ["joke", 0.018867924528301886], ["bargain", 0.018867924528301886], ["submitted", 0.018867924528301886], ["possibilities", 0.018867924528301886], ["intoxicated", 0.018867924528301886], ["marriage", 0.018867924528301886], ["fundamental", 0.018867924528301886], ["childhood", 0.018867924528301886]], "sentiment": ["It is about what life feels like to me.\nThere are all these tests of my limited agility and intelligence.

lunch with Mushari. He took nourishment alone in cheap cafeterias, and plotted the violent overthrow of the Rosewater Foundation. He knew no Rosewaters. What engaged his emotions was the fact that the Rosewater fortune was the largest single money package represented by McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee. He recalled what his favorite professor, Leonard Leech, once told him about getting ahead in law. Leech said that, just as a good airplane pilot should always be looking for places to land, so should a lawyer be looking for situations where large amounts of money were about to change hands.\n\"In every big transaction,\" said Leech, \"there is a magic moment during which a man has surrendered a treasure, and during which the man who is due to receive it has not yet done so. An alert lawyer will make that moment his own, possessing the treasure for a magic microsecond, taking a little of it, passing it on. If the man who is to receive the treasure is unused to wealth, has an inferiority complex and shapeless feelings of guilt, as most people do, the lawyer can often take as much as half the bundle, and still receive the recipient's blubbering thanks.\"\nThe more Mushari rifled the firm's confidential files relative to the Rosewater Foundation, the more excited he became. Especially thrilling to him was that part of the charter which called for the immediate expulsion of any officer adjudged insane. It was common gossip in the office that the very first president of the Foundation, Eliot Rosewater, the Senator's son, was a lunatic. This characterization was a somewhat playful one, but as Mushari knew, playfulness was impossible to explain in a court of law. Eliot was spoken of by Mushari's co-workers variously as \"The Nut,\" \"The Saint,\" \"The Holy Roller,\" \"John the Baptist,\" and so on.\n\"By all means,\" Mushari mooned to himself, \"we must get this specimen before a judge.\"\nFrom all reports, the person next in line to be President of the Foundation, a cousin in Rhode Island, was inferior in all respects. When the magic moment came, Mushari would represent him.\nMushari, being tone-deaf, did not know that he himself had an office nickname. It was contained in a tune that someone was generally whistling when he came or went. The tune was \"Pop Goes the Weasel.\"\nEliot Rosewater became President of the Foundation in 1947. When Mushari began to investigate him seventeen years later, Eliot was forty-six. Mushari, who thought of himself as brave little David about to slay Goliath, was exactly half his age. And it was almost as though God Himself wanted little David to win, for confidential document after document proved that Eliot was crazy as a loon.\nIn a locked file inside the firm's vault, for instance, was an envelope with three seals on it\u2014and it was supposed to be delivered unopened to whomever took over the Foundation when Eliot was dead.\nInside was a letter from Eliot, and this is what it said:\nDear Cousin, or whoever you may be\u2014", 0.07263392857142857], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["benjamin", 0.05], ["granfalloons", 0.05], ["hitz", 0.05], ["ben", 0.05], ["monkey", 0.05], ["slaughterhouse", 0.05], ["read", 0.05], ["house", 0.05], ["foma", 0.05], ["wampeters", 0.05], ["imagine", 0.05], ["youth", 0.05], ["wonderful", 0.05], ["books", 0.05], ["best", 0.05], ["wedding", 0.05], ["close", 0.05], ["slapstick", 0.05], ["friend", 0.05], ["man", 0.05]], "sentiment": ["Slapstick\nSlaughterhouse-Five\nWampeters, Foma & Granfalloons\nWelcome to the Monkey House\nFor Benjamin D.

passed down to yet another generation, there were practically none. Paul\u2019s wife, Anita, his secretary during the war, was barren. Ironically as anyone would please, he had married her after she had declared that she was certainly pregnant, following an abandoned office celebration of victory.\n\u201cLike that, kitty?\u201d With solicitousness and vicarious pleasure, young Proteus ran a roll of blueprints along the cat\u2019s arched back. \u201cMmmmm-aaaaah\u2014good, eh?\u201d He had spotted her that morning, near the golf course, and had picked her up as a mouser for the plant. Only the night before, a mouse had gnawed through the insulation on a control wire and put buildings 17, 19, and 21 temporarily out of commission.\nPaul turned on his intercom set. \u201cKatharine?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Doctor Proteus?\u201d\n\u201cKatharine, when\u2019s my speech going to be typed?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it now, sir. Ten, fifteen minutes, I promise.\u201d\nDoctor Katharine Finch was his secretary, and the only woman in the Ilium Works. Actually, she was more a symbol of rank than a real help, although she was useful as a stand-in when Paul was ill or took a notion to leave work early. Only the brass\u2014plant managers and bigger\u2014had secretaries. During the war, the managers and engineers had found that the bulk of secretarial work could be done\u2014as could most lower-echelon jobs\u2014more quickly and efficiently and cheaply by machines. Anita was about to be dismissed when Paul had married her. Now, for instance, Katharine was being annoyingly unmachine-like, dawdling over Paul\u2019s speech, and talking to her presumed lover, Doctor Bud Calhoun, at the same time.\nBud, who was manager of the petroleum terminal in Ilium, worked only when shipments came or went by barge or pipeline, and he spent most of his time between these crises\u2014as now\u2014filling Katharine\u2019s ears with the euphoria of his Georgia sweet talk.\nPaul took the cat in his arms and carried her to the enormous floor-to-ceiling window that comprised one wall. \u201cLots and lots of mice out there, kitty,\u201d he said.\nHe was showing the cat an old battlefield at peace. Here, in the basin of the river bend, the Mohawks had overpowered the Algonquins, the Dutch the Mohawks, the British the Dutch, the Americans the British. Now, over bones and rotten palings and cannon balls and arrowheads, there lay a triangle of steel and masonry buildings, a half-mile on each side\u2014the Illium Works. Where men had once howled and hacked at one another, and fought nip-and-tuck with nature as well, the machines hummed and whirred and clicked, and made parts for baby carriages and bottle caps, motorcycles and refrigerators, television sets and tricycles\u2014the fruits of peace.", 0.06128472222222221], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["key", 0.05], ["confido", 0.05], ["mirrors", 0.05], ["letter", 0.05], ["song", 0.05], ["club", 0.05], ["miller", 0.05], ["selma", 0.05], ["people", 0.05], ["jr", 0.05], ["hall", 0.05], ["shout", 0.05], ["1951", 0.05], ["luby", 0.05], ["vonnegut", 0.05], ["nice", 0.05], ["kurt", 0.05], ["fubar", 0.05], ["housetops", 0.05], ["walter", 0.05]], "sentiment": ["Letter from Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., to Walter J.

have written is in print today is due to the efforts of one publisher, Seymour \u201cSam\u201d Lawrence (1927\u20131994). When I was broke in 1965, and teaching at the Writers\u2019 Workshop at the University of Iowa all alone, completely out of print, having separated myself from my family on Cape Cod in order to support them, Sam bought rights to my books, for peanuts, from publishers, both hardcover and softcover, who had given up on me. Sam thrust my books back into the myopic public eye again.\nCPR! Cardiopulmonary resuscitation of this author who was all but dead!\nThus encouraged, this Lazarus wrote Slaughterhouse-Five for Sam. That made my reputation. I am a Humanist, and so am not entitled to expect an afterlife for myself or anyone. But at Seymour Lawrence\u2019s memorial service at New York City\u2019s Harvard Club five years ago, I said this with all my heart: \u201cSam is up in Heaven now.\u201d\nI returned to Dresden, incidentally, the setting for Slaughterhouse-Five, on October 7th, 1998. I was taken down into the cellar where I and about a hundred other American POWs survived a firestorm that suffocated or incinerated 135,000 or so other human beings. It reduced the \u201cFlorence of the Elbe\u201d to a jagged moonscape.\nWhile I was down in that cellar again, this thought came to me: \u201cBecause I have lived so long, I am one of the few persons on Earth who saw an Atlantis before it disappeared forever beneath the waves.\u201d\nShort stories can have greatness, short as they have to be. Several knocked my socks off when I was still in high school. Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Short Happy Life of Francis Ma-comber\u201d and Saki\u2019s \u201cThe Open Window\u201d and O. Henry\u2019s \u201cThe Gift of the Magi\u201d and Ambrose Bierce\u2019s \u201cAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\u201d spring to mind. But there is no greatness in this or my other collection, nor was there meant to be.\nMy own stories may be interesting, nonetheless, as relics from a time, before there was television, when an author might support a family by writing stories that satisfied uncritical readers of magazines, and earning thereby enough free time in which to write serious novels. When I became a full-time freelance in 1950, I expected to be doing that for the rest of my life.\nI was in such good company with a prospectus like that. Hemingway had written for Esquire, F. Scott Fitzgerald for The Saturday Evening Post, William Faulkner for Collier\u2019s, John Steinbeck for The Woman\u2019s Home Companion!\nSay what you want about me, I never wrote for a magazine called The Woman\u2019s Home Companion, but there was a time when I would have been most happy to. And I add this thought: Just because a woman is stuck alone at home, with her husband at work and her kids at school, that doesn\u2019t mean she is an imbecile.\nPublication of this book makes me want to talk about the peculiar and beneficial effect a short story can have on us, which makes it different from a novel or movie or play or TV show.", 0.06616892610313663], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["corkscrews", 0.022727272727272728], ["man", 0.022727272727272728], ["instructions", 0.015151515151515152], ["people", 0.015151515151515152], ["boy", 0.015151515151515152], ["welded", 0.015151515151515152], ["washington", 0.015151515151515152], ["carry", 0.015151515151515152], ["legs", 0.015151515151515152], ["brains", 0.015151515151515152], ["inside", 0.015151515151515152], ["crossroads", 0.015151515151515152], ["curb", 0.015151515151515152], ["looked", 0.015151515151515152], ["eaten", 0.015151515151515152], ["america", 0.015151515151515152], ["thought", 0.015151515151515152], ["infested", 0.007575757575757576], ["years", 0.007575757575757576], ["switches", 0.007575757575757576], ["sleep", 0.007575757575757576], ["human", 0.007575757575757576], ["corner", 0.007575757575757576], ["thyroid", 0.007575757575757576], ["chemical", 0.007575757575757576], ["mother", 0.007575757575757576], ["thinking", 0.007575757575757576], ["father", 0.007575757575757576], ["unhappy", 0.007575757575757576], ["meridian", 0.007575757575757576], ["overhanging", 0.007575757575757576], ["victims", 0.007575757575757576], ["underneath", 0.007575757575757576], ["syphilitics", 0.007575757575757576], ["earthlings", 0.007575757575757576], ["intersection", 0.007575757575757576], ["day", 0.007575757575757576], ["meat", 0.007575757575757576], ["shuddered", 0.007575757575757576], ["chorus", 0.007575757575757576], ["microscope", 0.007575757575757576], ["small", 0.007575757575757576], ["syphilitic", 0.007575757575757576], ["reactions", 0.007575757575757576], ["streets", 0.007575757575757576], ["alive", 0.007575757575757576], ["street", 0.007575757575757576], ["girl", 0.007575757575757576], ["clock", 0.007575757575757576], ["dwayne", 0.007575757575757576], ["wrecked", 0.007575757575757576], ["tend", 0.007575757575757576], ["shut", 0.007575757575757576], ["kicked", 0.007575757575757576], ["hero", 0.007575757575757576], ["originated", 0.007575757575757576], ["step", 0.007575757575757576], ["carnivorous", 0.007575757575757576], ["rubbery", 0.007575757575757576], ["pill", 0.007575757575757576], ["thirty", 0.007575757575757576], ["times", 0.007575757575757576], ["ounce", 0.007575757575757576], ["stand", 0.007575757575757576], ["consume", 0.007575757575757576], ["beings", 0.007575757575757576], ["throats", 0.007575757575757576], ["motor", 0.007575757575757576], ["vertebrae", 0.007575757575757576], ["open", 0.007575757575757576], ["straight", 0.007575757575757576], ["locally", 0.007575757575757576], ["erect", 0.007575757575757576], ["lot", 0.007575757575757576], ["eyes", 0.007575757575757576], ["hard", 0.007575757575757576], ["squash", 0.007575757575757576], ["wires", 0.007575757575757576], ["millionth", 0.007575757575757576], ["chemicals", 0.007575757575757576], ["lives", 0.007575757575757576], ["ahead", 0.007575757575757576], ["depressed", 0.007575757575757576], ["tremendously", 0.007575757575757576], ["weren", 0.007575757575757576], ["supposed", 0.007575757575757576], ["growing", 0.007575757575757576], ["problem", 0.007575757575757576], ["iodine", 0.007575757575757576], ["turned", 0.007575757575757576], ["gently", 0.007575757575757576], ["dealer", 0.007575757575757576], ["machine", 0.007575757575757576], ["book", 0.007575757575757576], ["goiters", 0.007575757575757576], ["test", 0.007575757575757576], ["ordinary", 0.007575757575757576], ["dignified", 0.007575757575757576], ["zucchini", 0.007575757575757576], ["insulated", 0.007575757575757576], ["hoover", 0.007575757575757576], ["pontiac", 0.007575757575757576], ["huge", 0.007575757575757576], ["glands", 0.007575757575757576], ["swollen", 0.007575757575757576], ["designed", 0.007575757575757576], ["idling", 0.007575757575757576], ["clear", 0.007575757575757576], ["cheer", 0.007575757575757576], ["seething", 0.007575757575757576], ["time", 0.007575757575757576], ["tubes", 0.007575757575757576], ["order", 0.007575757575757576]], "sentiment": ["Those people were infested with carnivorous little corkscrews which could be seen only with a microscope.

He wanted to get things right but never thought that his writing was going to have much effect on the course of things. His models were Jonah, Lincoln, Melville, and Twain.\nHe rewrote and rewrote and rewrote, muttering whatever he had just written over and over, tilting his head back and forth, gesturing with his hands, changing the pitch and rhythm of the words. Then he would pause, thoughtfully rip the barely written-on sheet of typing paper from the typewriter, crumple it up, throw it away, and start over again. It seemed like an odd way for a grown-up to spend his time, but I was just a child who didn\u2019t know much.\nHe had an extra gear language-wise. At eighty-plus he was still doing the New York Times crossword puzzles quickly and in ink and never asking for help. As soon as I told him the verb came last, he could translate my Latin homework at sight, without having ever taken Latin. His novels, speeches, short stories, and even dust-jacket comments are very carefully crafted.
