Would that be possible?\nI\u2019ve put the completely edited copy of Mother Night into the mail for you. All I\u2019ve done to it is add one page to the introduction.

For cover art, what about a skeleton dressed and posed as a kittenish whore?\nI\u2019ve been reading Axel\u2019s Castle\u2014have learned that I am a classicist, now moving (by using the first person) into romanticism. Marvellous. Good for me. The trouble is that the radio is on all the time, with news every hour and bulletins any time, and the facts of life bop me at random between militarism, dadaism and onanism. It is hard to know whether to shit or go blind. [\u2026]\nI\u2019m doing a play on the side. That goes easy, God bless it. It isn\u2019t arch. It is both comic and tragic, in the modern manner.

news of this day in August, halfway through the rerun, as yet another autumn draws near: My big brother Bernie, the born scientist who may know more about the electrification of thunderstorms than anyone, has an invariably fatal cancer, too far advanced to be daunted by the Three Horsemen of the Oncologic Apocalypse, Surgery, Chemotherapy, and Radiation.\nBernie still feels fine.\nIt is much too early to talk about, but when he dies, God forbid, I don\u2019t think his ashes should be put in Crown Hill Cemetery with James Whitcomb Riley and John Dillinger, who belonged only to Indiana. Bernie belongs to the World.\nBernie\u2019s ashes should be scattered over the dome of a towering thunderhead.\n39\nSo there was Roger Downs of Indianapolis in Colorado. Here am I, of Indianapolis, on the South Fork of Long Island. The ashes of my Indianapolis wife Jane Marie Cox are mixed with the roots of a flowering cherry tree, unmarked, in Barnstable Village, Massachusetts. The branches of that tree can be seen from the ell that Ted Adler rebuilt from scratch, after which he asked, \u201cHow the hell did I do that?\u201d\nThe Best Man at Jane\u2019s and my wedding in Indianapolis, Benjamin Hitz of Indianapolis, is a widower now in Santa Barbara, California. Ben dated an Indianapolis cousin of mine several times this spring. She is a widow on the seacoast of Maryland, and my sister died in New Jersey, and my brother, although he doesn\u2019t feel like it yet, is dying in Albany, New York.\nMy boyhood pal David Craig, who made a radio in a German tank stop playing popular music during World War Two, is a builder in New Orleans. My cousin Emmy, whose dad told me I was a man at last when I came home from war, and who was my lab partner in physics class at Shortridge High School, lives only about thirty miles east of Dave in Louisiana.\nDiaspora!\nWhy did so many of us bug out of a city built by our ancestors, where our family names were respected, whose streets and speech were so familiar, and where, as I said at Butler University last June, there was indeed the best and worst of Western Civilization?", 0.18966991341991343], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["herbert", 0.08955223880597014], ["father", 0.07462686567164178], ["wonderful", 0.04477611940298507], ["picture", 0.04477611940298507], ["mother", 0.04477611940298507], ["girl", 0.029850746268656716], ["good", 0.029850746268656716], ["alma", 0.029850746268656716], ["married", 0.029850746268656716], ["eh", 0.014925373134328358], ["point", 0.014925373134328358], ["taste", 0.014925373134328358], ["paused", 0.014925373134328358], ["respectable", 0.014925373134328358], ["tinted", 0.014925373134328358], ["taught", 0.014925373134328358], ["dear", 0.014925373134328358], ["fearing", 0.014925373134328358], ["looked", 0.014925373134328358], ["prove", 0.014925373134328358], ["decent", 0.014925373134328358], ["thanked", 0.014925373134328358], ["relations", 0.014925373134328358], ["grim", 0.014925373134328358], ["amazing", 0.014925373134328358], ["music", 0.014925373134328358], ["deserted", 0.014925373134328358], ["saint", 0.014925373134328358], ["public", 0.014925373134328358], ["smart", 0.014925373134328358], ["dad", 0.014925373134328358], ["started", 0.014925373134328358], ["sore", 0.014925373134328358], ["mention", 0.014925373134328358], ["child", 0.014925373134328358], ["effort", 0.014925373134328358], ["feeble", 0.014925373134328358], ["mantel", 0.014925373134328358], ["photograph", 0.014925373134328358], ["likeness", 0.014925373134328358], ["wife", 0.014925373134328358], ["god", 0.014925373134328358], ["leave", 0.014925373134328358], ["informative", 0.014925373134328358], ["person", 0.014925373134328358], ["small", 0.014925373134328358], ["classics", 0.014925373134328358], ["musical", 0.014925373134328358]], "sentiment": ["I thanked Alma, and started to leave.

country squire in a Sherlock Holmes story, opening a curious envelope that had arrived in the post that day.\u201d It was indeed a Christmas card, and timely, since Christmas was only two weeks away. It was nondenominational, secular humanist, since the salutation, in gold cursive letters on its cover, was simply: \u201cJoy.\u201d No exclamation point. The printed message inside could hardly have inflamed the most short-fused Zoroastrian or Baha\u2019i or Parsi, or crustiest crackpot village atheist, for it was simply this: \u201cMay the season\u2019s warmth fill your home with happiness.\u201d\nBeneath, however, was this handwritten personal message in blue ink: \u201cHi, funny man, I am your sister. I am currently an English teacher and drama coach and soccer coach and dorm mom at the Nellie Prior Academy, a private college preparatory school (har-dee-har-har) for girls here in Northampton. Here\u2019s my DNA, if you don\u2019t believe it. Where\u2019s yours?\u201d And there was an arrow pointing down to a dot, which was red. Menstrual blood? He sure hoped not. The signature was \u201cKimberley Berlin.\u201d\nHe thought little more about it. Women did not make passes at him, but it was common for one to demonstrate that she thought technological progress was as much a crock of shit as he did. The red dot was evidently an attempt at satire on all the yahoo horseshit about genetic engineering: how cloning sheep and decoding the human gene chain and so on were going to make being alive so much more rewarding than it had been to date. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cSo what else is new?\u201d He put the card back into its envelope and sailed both into the blaze of propane.\nBut that wasn\u2019t quite the end of it. His brain, which he had come to consider a quite separate person, autopsied the event in search of a joke. It found one! Bingo! Pay dirt! Try this: \u201cIf DNA technology discovers who it is in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, will they kick him out?\u201d\nHe mused that if this Kimberley Berlin had declared herself his daughter rather than his sister, and the desk clerk said she had red hair like his, it might have shocked him for a minute or two. He did have a daughter out in the world somewhere, who would be eighteen, too young to be a prep-school teacher. For that daughter\u2019s sake as well as his own, he had thought about her as little as possible. What good could he be for her, or she for him? He thought it fair to assume that Fate had given her a stable, loving, dependable stepfather. How would it help anybody if a biological father were suddenly to blindside her in the backfield, so to speak? He did nonetheless find himself reminded, there in front of the fire, of another sealed envelope handed to him by another woman when he was still in Caldwell for the second time.\nThe woman? Dr. Helen Newman Klein. From the transcript of their second and final session of talk therapy: B: What\u2019s this? A fan letter or hate mail?\nK:I thought you should read it at the start of this session. Then we can both make jokes for the rest of the hour. Why did the chicken cross the road, and so on.\nB: Before I open it, I do want to tell you what I\u2019ve learned from a fellow patient, a heroin addict who is also an ornithologist.\nK: As long as he isn\u2019t your brother Heathcliffe.\nB: I\u2019ll bring you up to date on Heathie in a minute.

It was the flag of Ceylon.\nAnd past that was a red ball on a white field, the flag of Japan.\nThe banners signified the countries that the various Martian units would attack and paralyze when the war between Mars and Earth began.\nUnk saw no banners until his antenna let his shoulders sag, let his joints loosen\u2014let him fall out. He gawked at the long perspective of barracks and flagpoles. The barrack before which he stood had a large number painted over the door. The number was 576.\nSome part of Unk found the number fascinating, made Unk study it. Then he remembered the execution\u2014remembered that the red-headed man he had killed had told him something about a blue stone and barrack twelve.\nInside barrack 576, Unk cleaned his rifle, found it an extremely pleasant thing to do. He found, moreover, that he still knew how to take the weapon apart. That much of his memory, at any rate, had not been wiped out at the hospital. It made him furtively happy to suspect that there were probably other parts of his memory that had been missed as well. Why this suspicion should make him furtively happy he didn\u2019t know.\nHe swabbed away at his rifle\u2019s bore. His weapon was an 11-millimeter German Mauser, single shot, a type of rifle that made its reputation when used by the Spaniards in the Earthling Spanish-American War. All of the Martian Army\u2019s rifles were of about the same vintage. Martian agents, working quietly on Earth, had been able to buy up huge quantities of Mausers and British Enfields and American Springfields for next to nothing.\nUnk\u2019s squadmates were swabbing their bores, too. The oil smelled good, and the oily patches, twisting through the rifling, resisted the thrust of the cleaning rod just enough to be interesting. There was hardly any talk.\nNo one seemed to have taken particular notice of the execution. If there had been a lesson in the execution for Unk\u2019s squadmates, they were finding the lesson as digestible as Pablum.\nThere had been only one comment on Unk\u2019s participation in the

And during their early years on Santa Rosalia, until Mary Hepburn made them the gift of babies, that was what they were most grateful for: At least they had each other\u2014and their own language and their own religious beliefs and jokes and songs and so on.\nAnd that was what they would leave to their children on Santa Rosalia when they entered, one by one, the blue tunnel into the Afterlife: the comforts of at least having each other, and the Kanka-bono language, and the Kanka-bono religion, and the Kanka-bono jokes and songs.\nDuring their bad old days in Guayaquil, old Quezeda offered his stinking body for their experimentation as he taught them, as little as they were, the fundamental skills and attitudes of prostitutes.\nThey were certainly in need of rescue, long before the economic crisis. Yes, and one dusty window of the shed which was their gruesome schoolhouse framed the stern of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin right outside. Little did they know that that beautiful white ship would soon be their Noah\u2019s ark.\nThe girls finally ran away from the old man. They began to live in the streets, still begging and stealing. But, for reasons they could not understand, tourists became harder and harder to find, and, at last, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything to eat anywhere. They were truly hungry now, as they approached simply anyone, opening their mouths wide and rolling their eyes and pointing down their little throats to show how long it had been since they had eaten.\nAnd late one afternoon, they were attracted by the sounds of the crowd around the El Dorado. They found that the back door of a shuttered shop was open, and out came Geraldo Delgado, who had just shot Andrew MacIntosh and Zenji Hiroguchi. So they went into the shop and out of the front door. They were inside the barrier set up by the soldiers, so there was nobody to stop them from entering the El Dorado, where they would throw themselves on the mercy of James Wait in the cocktail lounge.\n29\nMARY HEPBURN was meanwhile murdering herself up in her room, lying on her bed with the polyethylene sheath of her \u201cJackie dress\u201d wrapped around her head. The sheath was now all steamed up inside, and she hallucinated that she was a great land tortoise lying on its back in the hot and humid hold of a sailing ship of long ago. She pawed the air in perfect futility, just as a land tortoise on its back would have done.\nAs she had often told her students, sailing ships bound out across the Pacific used to stop off in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands to capture defenseless tortoises, who could live on their backs without food or water for months. They were so slow and tame and huge and plentiful. Sailors would capsize them without fear of being bitten or clawed. Then they would drag them down to waiting longboats on the shore, using the animals\u2019 own useless suits of armor for sleds.\nThey would store them on their backs in the dark, paying no further attention to them until it was time for them to be eaten. The beauty of the tortoises to the sailors was that they were fresh meat which did not have to be refrigerated or eaten right away.", 0.01755454794247897], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["black", 0.03546099290780142], ["gregory", 0.028368794326241134], ["white", 0.028368794326241134], ["boys", 0.028368794326241134], ["dan", 0.02127659574468085], ["collection", 0.02127659574468085], ["years", 0.014184397163120567], ["upstairs", 0.014184397163120567], ["house", 0.014184397163120567], ["barn", 0.014184397163120567], ["ways", 0.014184397163120567], ["sold", 0.014184397163120567], ["story", 0.014184397163120567], ["great", 0.014184397163120567], ["thought", 0.014184397163120567], ["allison", 0.014184397163120567], ["picture", 0.014184397163120567], ["potato", 0.014184397163120567], ["considered", 0.014184397163120567], ["painting", 0.014184397163120567], ["walking", 0.0070921985815602835], ["discovered", 0.0070921985815602835], ["verman", 0.0070921985815602835], ["rooms", 0.0070921985815602835], ["find", 0.0070921985815602835], ["talking", 0.0070921985815602835], ["lubbock", 0.0070921985815602835], ["hadn", 0.0070921985815602835], ["brained", 0.0070921985815602835], ["edith", 0.0070921985815602835], ["better", 0.0070921985815602835], ["going", 0.0070921985815602835], ["texas", 0.0070921985815602835], ["real", 0.0070921985815602835], ["breathing", 0.0070921985815602835], ["views", 0.0070921985815602835], ["half", 0.0070921985815602835], ["quarters", 0.0070921985815602835], ["encounter", 0.0070921985815602835], ["large", 0.0070921985815602835], ["hung", 0.0070921985815602835], ["entirely", 0.0070921985815602835], ["works", 0.0070921985815602835], ["husband", 0.0070921985815602835], ["ten", 0.0070921985815602835], ["people", 0.0070921985815602835], ["booth", 0.0070921985815602835], ["dear", 0.0070921985815602835], ["happen", 0.0070921985815602835], ["insurance", 0.0070921985815602835], ["paintings", 0.0070921985815602835], ["seriously", 0.0070921985815602835], ["playmates", 0.0070921985815602835], ["told", 0.0070921985815602835], ["tamed", 0.0070921985815602835], ["sagaponack", 0.0070921985815602835], ["illustration", 0.0070921985815602835], ["souvenir", 0.0070921985815602835], ["hours", 0.0070921985815602835], ["reason", 0.0070921985815602835], ["care", 0.0070921985815602835], ["residence", 0.0070921985815602835], ["days", 0.0070921985815602835], ["millionaire", 0.0070921985815602835], ["thing", 0.0070921985815602835], ["magazine", 0.0070921985815602835], ["raccoon", 0.0070921985815602835], ["priceless", 0.0070921985815602835], ["museum", 0.0070921985815602835], ["celeste", 0.0070921985815602835], ["private", 0.0070921985815602835], ["simply", 0.0070921985815602835], ["names", 0.0070921985815602835], ["blank", 0.0070921985815602835], ["comical", 0.0070921985815602835], ["guess", 0.0070921985815602835], ["guest", 0.0070921985815602835], ["deep", 0.0070921985815602835], ["caught", 0.0070921985815602835], ["bathroom", 0.0070921985815602835], ["paint", 0.0070921985815602835], ["master", 0.0070921985815602835], ["wondering", 0.0070921985815602835], ["complete", 0.0070921985815602835], ["western", 0.0070921985815602835], ["regrettably", 0.0070921985815602835], ["downstairs", 0.0070921985815602835], ["apprentice", 0.0070921985815602835], ["town", 0.0070921985815602835], ["heard", 0.0070921985815602835], ["tarkington", 0.0070921985815602835], ["called", 0.0070921985815602835], ["photographs", 0.0070921985815602835], ["estate", 0.0070921985815602835], ["century", 0.0070921985815602835], ["alley", 0.0070921985815602835], ["middle", 0.0070921985815602835], ["reliving", 0.0070921985815602835], ["afraid", 0.0070921985815602835], ["built", 0.0070921985815602835], ["things", 0.0070921985815602835], ["beach", 0.0070921985815602835], ["hermit", 0.0070921985815602835], ["separate", 0.0070921985815602835], ["herman", 0.0070921985815602835], ["died", 0.0070921985815602835], ["ocean", 0.0070921985815602835], ["looked", 0.0070921985815602835], ["person", 0.0070921985815602835], ["enter", 0.0070921985815602835]], "sentiment": ["But then I caught on that she was talking about a painting I had never considered a part of my collection, but simply a souvenir. It was by none other than Dan Gregory! It was a magazine illustration for a Booth Tarkington story about an encounter in the back alley of a middle-western town, not in this century but in the one before, between two white boys and two black\u2014about ten years old.\nIn the picture, they were obviously wondering if they could be playmates, or whether they had better go their separate ways.\nIn the story, the two black boys had very comical names: \u201cHerman\u201d and \u201cVerman.\u201d I often heard it said that nobody could paint black people like Dan Gregory, but he did it entirely from photographs. One of the first things he ever said to me was that he would never have a black person in his house.\nI thought that was great. I thought everything he said was great for a little while. I was going to become what he was, and regrettably did in many ways.\nI sold that painting of the two black boys and the two white boys to a real-estate and insurance millionaire in Lubbock, Texas, who has the most complete collection of Dan Gregory paintings in the world, he told me. As far as I know, he has the only such collection, for which he has built a large private museum.\nHe discovered somehow that I used to be Gregory\u2019s apprentice, and he called me up to ask if I had any of my master\u2019s works I was willing to part with. I had only that one, which I hadn\u2019t looked at for years, since it hung in the bathroom of one of the many guest rooms here which I had had no reason to enter.\n\u201cYou sold the only picture that was really about something,\u201d said Allison White. \u201cI used to look at it and try and guess what would happen next.\u201d\nOh: one last thing Allison White said to me before she and Celeste went upstairs to their quarters which had priceless ocean views: \u201cWe\u2019ll get out of your way now,\u201d she said, \u201cand we don\u2019t care if we never find out what\u2019s in the potato barn.\u201d\nSo there I was all alone downstairs. I was afraid to go upstairs. I didn\u2019t want to be in the house at all, and seriously considered taking up residence again as what I had been to dear Edith after her first husband died: a half-tamed old raccoon in the potato

perceive them. He also insists op dealing with only the most hackneyed themes. After a thousand World War II airplane novels had been published and pulped, he gave us yet another one, which was gradually acknowledged as a sanely crazy masterpiece.\nNow he offers us the thousand and first version of The Hucksters or The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.\nThere is a nattily dressed, sourly witty middle-management executive named Robert Slocum, he tells us, who lives in a nice house in Connecticut with a wife, a daughter, and two sons. Slocum works in Manhattan in the communications racket. He is restless. He mourns the missed opportunities of his youth. He is itchy for raises and promotions, even though he despises his company and the jobs he does. He commits unsatisfying adulteries now and then at sales conferences in resort areas, during long lunch hours, or while pretending to work late at the office.\nHe is exhausted.\nHe dreads old age.\nMr. Heller\u2019s rewriting of this written-to-death situation took him 12 years. It comes out as a monologue by Slocum. Nobody else gets to talk, except as reported by Slocum. And Slocum\u2019s sentences are so alike in shape and texture from the beginning to the end of the book, that I imagined a man who was making an enormous statue out of sheet metal. He was shaping it with millions of identical taps from a ball-peen hammer.\nEach dent was a fact, a depressingly ordinary fact.\n\u201cMy wife is a good person, really, or used to be,\u201d says Slocum near the beginning, \u201cand sometimes I\u2019m sorry for her. She drinks during the day and flirts, or tries to, at parties we go to in the evening, although she doesn\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\u201cI have given my daughter a car of her own,\u201d he says near the end. \u201cHer spirits seem to be picking up.\u201d\nSlocum does his deadly best to persuade us, with his tap-tap-tapping of facts, that he is compelled to be as unhappy as he is, not because of enemies or flaws in his own character, but because of the facts.", 0.11086956521739132], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["amy", 0.07476635514018691], ["building", 0.037383177570093455], ["night", 0.028037383177570093], ["door", 0.028037383177570093], ["cinders", 0.018691588785046728], ["heart", 0.018691588785046728], ["wife", 0.018691588785046728], ["nodded", 0.009345794392523364], ["yellow", 0.009345794392523364], ["police", 0.009345794392523364], ["womanhood", 0.009345794392523364], ["forms", 0.009345794392523364], ["wood", 0.009345794392523364], ["beat", 0.009345794392523364], ["panting", 0.009345794392523364], ["heard", 0.009345794392523364], ["railroad", 0.009345794392523364], ["killed", 0.009345794392523364], ["sighed", 0.009345794392523364], ["signal", 0.009345794392523364], ["gun", 0.009345794392523364], ["stopped", 0.009345794392523364], ["small", 0.009345794392523364], ["pried", 0.009345794392523364], ["temples", 0.009345794392523364], ["pushed", 0.009345794392523364], ["glinting", 0.009345794392523364], ["sea", 0.009345794392523364], ["girl", 0.009345794392523364], ["stood", 0.009345794392523364], ["lights", 0.009345794392523364], ["waiting", 0.009345794392523364], ["red", 0.009345794392523364], ["told", 0.009345794392523364], ["whispered", 0.009345794392523364], ["chose", 0.009345794392523364], ["twinkling", 0.009345794392523364], ["loomed", 0.009345794392523364], ["roaring", 0.009345794392523364], ["hasp", 0.009345794392523364], ["care", 0.009345794392523364], ["yard", 0.009345794392523364], ["shipping", 0.009345794392523364], ["ounce", 0.009345794392523364], ["hulking", 0.009345794392523364], ["wall", 0.009345794392523364], ["brought", 0.009345794392523364], ["aimed", 0.009345794392523364], ["open", 0.009345794392523364], ["weathered", 0.009345794392523364], ["top", 0.009345794392523364], ["rails", 0.009345794392523364], ["clapboards", 0.009345794392523364], ["breath", 0.009345794392523364], ["trigger", 0.009345794392523364], ["listen", 0.009345794392523364], ["eyes", 0.009345794392523364], ["streaked", 0.009345794392523364], ["snatch", 0.009345794392523364], ["padlock", 0.009345794392523364], ["understand", 0.009345794392523364], ["227", 0.009345794392523364], ["worked", 0.009345794392523364], ["spin", 0.009345794392523364], ["eat", 0.009345794392523364], ["intake", 0.009345794392523364], ["grew", 0.009345794392523364], ["talking", 0.009345794392523364], ["inside", 0.009345794392523364], ["harder", 0.009345794392523364], ["knocked", 0.009345794392523364], ["minutes", 0.009345794392523364], ["moved", 0.009345794392523364], ["imagination", 0.009345794392523364], ["dropped", 0.009345794392523364], ["squat", 0.009345794392523364], ["dying", 0.009345794392523364], ["sprinkled", 0.009345794392523364], ["bus", 0.009345794392523364], ["department", 0.009345794392523364], ["driver", 0.009345794392523364], ["running", 0.009345794392523364], ["blood", 0.009345794392523364], ["man", 0.009345794392523364], ["walked", 0.009345794392523364], ["edge", 0.009345794392523364], ["green", 0.009345794392523364], ["hostetter", 0.009345794392523364], ["pulled", 0.009345794392523364], ["hello", 0.009345794392523364]], "sentiment": ["Amy nodded.

Don\u2019t you understand? Don\u2019t you care?

The building loomed, and my wife-to-be stopped against its weathered clapboards, panting, and trying to listen above the roaring of blood at her temples.\nSomeone moved inside, and sighed.\nAmy worked her way along the outside wall to the door. The padlock and hasp had been pried from the old wood.\nAmy knocked on the door. \u201cHello,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI brought you something to eat.\u201d\nAmy heard an intake of breath, nothing more.\nShe pushed open the door.", 0.11761904761904761], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["call", 0.041666666666666664], ["bird", 0.041666666666666664], ["cry", 0.020833333333333332], ["simultaneously", 0.020833333333333332], ["children", 0.020833333333333332], ["asks", 0.020833333333333332], ["spoke", 0.020833333333333332], ["manhattan", 0.020833333333333332], ["knowing", 0.010416666666666666], ["ten", 0.010416666666666666], ["regained", 0.010416666666666666], ["national", 0.010416666666666666], ["piercing", 0.010416666666666666], ["whippoorwill", 0.010416666666666666], ["swain", 0.010416666666666666], ["sundown", 0.010416666666666666], ["dread", 0.010416666666666666], ["treasured", 0.010416666666666666], ["follow", 0.010416666666666666], ["melody", 0.010416666666666666], ["clarity", 0.010416666666666666], ["whip", 0.010416666666666666], ["speak", 0.010416666666666666], ["death", 0.010416666666666666], ["mainland", 0.010416666666666666], ["clock", 0.010416666666666666], ["turret", 0.010416666666666666], ["automobile", 0.010416666666666666], ["whipping", 0.010416666666666666], ["lead", 0.010416666666666666], ["question", 0.010416666666666666], ["hieronymus", 0.010416666666666666], ["equal", 0.010416666666666666], ["parents", 0.010416666666666666], ["skyscraper", 0.010416666666666666], ["eliza", 0.010416666666666666], ["learned", 0.010416666666666666], ["joke", 0.010416666666666666], ["bosch", 0.010416666666666666], ["angkor", 0.010416666666666666], ["common", 0.010416666666666666], ["poor", 0.010416666666666666], ["occasion", 0.010416666666666666], ["humorlessness", 0.010416666666666666], ["street", 0.010416666666666666], ["dictionary", 0.010416666666666666], ["cordiner", 0.010416666666666666], ["island", 0.010416666666666666], ["park", 0.010416666666666666], ["heard", 0.010416666666666666], ["nocturnal", 0.010416666666666666], ["goatsucker", 0.010416666666666666], ["nightmare", 0.010416666666666666], ["cape", 0.010416666666666666], ["sun", 0.010416666666666666], ["dr", 0.010416666666666666], ["severely", 0.010416666666666666], ["school", 0.010416666666666666], ["wat", 0.010416666666666666], ["tank", 0.010416666666666666], ["calls", 0.010416666666666666], ["thirty", 0.010416666666666666], ["called", 0.010416666666666666], ["19", 0.010416666666666666], ["seldom", 0.010416666666666666], ["army", 0.010416666666666666], ["tree", 0.010416666666666666], ["cordelia", 0.010416666666666666], ["fainted", 0.010416666666666666], ["morning", 0.010416666666666666], ["will", 0.010416666666666666], ["chairs", 0.010416666666666666], ["naming", 0.010416666666666666], ["disturbed", 0.010416666666666666], ["correct", 0.010416666666666666], ["cod", 0.010416666666666666], ["superstitious", 0.010416666666666666], ["things", 0.010416666666666666], ["growing", 0.010416666666666666], ["inspired", 0.010416666666666666], ["creature", 0.010416666666666666], ["painting", 0.010416666666666666], ["example", 0.010416666666666666], ["isadore", 0.010416666666666666]], "sentiment": ["When we regained our chairs, Dr. Cordelia Swain Cordiner had fainted, and our parents were gone.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAt ten o\u2019clock the next morning, I was taken by automobile to a school for severely disturbed children on Cape Cod.\n19\nIT IS SUNDOWN AGAIN.

She was a pretty, pinched, skinny, lost little woman, all dolled-up in well-made clothes cast off by her wealthy, Lesbian friend, Amanita Buntline. Caroline Rosewater clinked and flashed with accessories. Their purpose was to make the second-hand clothing distinctly her own. She was going to have lunch with Amanita.

With the avid help of Amanita, she pitied herself for being married to a man who was so poor and dull. That she was exactly as poor and dull as Fred was a possibility she was constitutionally unable to entertain. For one thing, she was a Phi Beta Kappa, having won her key as a philosophy major at Dillon University, in Dodge City, Kansas. That was where she and Fred had met, in Dodge City, in a U.S.O. Fred had been stationed at Fort Riley during the Korean War.

My goodness\u2014the family secrets I had learned over the years and kept to myself! My lips were sealed. What a faithful old retainer I was! But that was all I was to the Trustees, and probably to the students, too.\nI wasn\u2019t an uncle. I was a member of the Servant Class.\nThey were letting me go.\nSoldiers are discharged. People in the workplace are fired. Servants are let go.\n\u201cAm I being fired?\u201d I asked the Chairman of the Board incredulously.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gene,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re going to have to let you go.\u201d\nTHE PRESIDENT OF the college, Tex Johnson, sitting two chairs away from me, hadn\u2019t let out a peep. He looked sick. I surmised mistakenly that he had been scolded for having let me stay on the faculty long enough to get tenure. He was sick about something more personal, which still had a lot to do with Professor Eugene Debs Hartke.\nHe had been brought in as President from Rollins College down in Winter Park, Florida, where he had been Provost, after Sam Wakefield did the big trick of suicide. Henry \u201cTex\u201d Johnson held a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Business Administration from Texas Tech in Lubbock, and claimed to be a descendant of a man who had died in the Alamo. Damon Stern, who was always turning up little-known facts of history, told me, incidentally, that the Battle of the Alamo was about slavery. The brave men who died there wanted to secede from Mexico because it was against the law to own slaves in Mexico. They were fighting for the right to own slaves.\nSince Tex\u2019s wife and I had been lovers, I knew that his ancestors weren\u2019t Texans, but Lithuanians. His father, whose name certainly wasn\u2019t Johnson, was a Lithuanian second mate on a Russian freighter who jumped ship when it put in for emergency repairs at Corpus Christi. Zuzu told me that Tex\u2019s father was not only an illegal immigrant but the nephew of the former Communist boss of Lithuania.\nSo much for the Alamo.", 0.010096500721500713], "title": "Hocus

Those few nonparticipants who dropped in at the church to see the exhibits, and who hadn\u2019t heard about the judging, were amazed to find one lonely object, a petit-point copy of the cover of a woman\u2019s magazine, on view. Pinned to it was the single blue ribbon awarded that day. The other exhibitors had angrily hauled home their rejected offerings, and the sole prizewinner appeared late in the evening, embarrassed and furtive, to take her entry home, leaving the blue ribbon behind.\nOnly Newell Cady and Upton Beaton slept peacefully that night, with feelings of solid, worthwhile work behind them. But when Monday came again, there was a dogged cheerfulness in the town, for on Sunday, as though to offset the holocaust of the Hobby Show, the real estate man had been around. He had been writing to Federal Apparatus Corporation executives in New York, telling them of the mansions in Spruce Falls that could virtually be stolen from the simple-hearted natives and that were but a stone\u2019s throw from the prospective home of their esteemed colleague Mr. Newell Cady. What the real estate man had to show on Sunday were letters from executives who believed him.\nBy late afternoon on Monday, the last bitter word about the Hobby Show had been spoken, and talk centered now on the computation of capital gains taxes, the ruthless destruction of profit motives by the state and federal governments, the outrageous cost of building small houses\u2014\n\u201cBut I tell you,\u201d said Chief Atkins, \u201cunder this new law, you don\u2019t have to pay any tax on the profit you make off of selling your house. All that profit is just a paper profit, just plain, ordinary inflation, and they don\u2019t tax you on that, because it wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d He and Upton Beaton and Ed Newcomb were talking in the post office, while Mrs. Dickie sorted the late-afternoon mail.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Beaton, \u201cbut you have to buy another house for at least as much as you got for your old one, in order to come under that law.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would I want with a fifty-thousand-dollar house?\u201d said Newcomb, awed.", -0.1062628161312372], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["trout", 0.05263157894736842], ["driver", 0.039473684210526314], ["books", 0.039473684210526314], ["gary", 0.02631578947368421], ["magazines", 0.02631578947368421], ["wanted", 0.02631578947368421], ["cooper", 0.02631578947368421], ["hitchhiking", 0.02631578947368421], ["man", 0.02631578947368421], ["um", 0.02631578947368421], ["libertyville", 0.02631578947368421], ["em", 0.013157894736842105], ["ahead", 0.013157894736842105], ["pieces", 0.013157894736842105], ["process", 0.013157894736842105], ["library", 0.013157894736842105], ["fifty", 0.013157894736842105], ["carry", 0.013157894736842105], ["tons", 0.013157894736842105], ["sudden", 0.013157894736842105], ["freight", 0.013157894736842105], ["wife", 0.013157894736842105], ["pulping", 0.013157894736842105], ["speed", 0.013157894736842105], ["children", 0.013157894736842105], ["city", 0.013157894736842105], ["midland", 0.013157894736842105], ["bringing", 0.013157894736842105], ["pregnant", 0.013157894736842105], ["start", 0.013157894736842105], ["miles", 0.013157894736842105], ["speeding", 0.013157894736842105], ["truck", 0.013157894736842105], ["white", 0.013157894736842105], ["main", 0.013157894736842105], ["unloading", 0.013157894736842105], ["blowing", 0.013157894736842105], ["star", 0.013157894736842105], ["material", 0.013157894736842105], ["hundreds", 0.013157894736842105], ["paper", 0.013157894736842105], ["unwanted", 0.013157894736842105], ["mad", 0.013157894736842105], ["sloppy", 0.013157894736842105], ["fifteen", 0.013157894736842105], ["day", 0.013157894736842105], ["town", 0.013157894736842105], ["georgia", 0.013157894736842105], ["yard", 0.013157894736842105], ["trucks", 0.013157894736842105], ["hour", 0.013157894736842105], ["policeman", 0.013157894736842105], ["newspapers", 0.013157894736842105], ["arrested", 0.013157894736842105], ["movie", 0.013157894736842105], ["jail", 0.013157894736842105], ["trap", 0.013157894736842105], ["trains", 0.013157894736842105], ["making", 0.013157894736842105], ["industry", 0.013157894736842105], ["printed", 0.013157894736842105]], "sentiment": ["\u201cIf it isn\u2019t in Midland City,\u201d said the driver, \u201cit\u2019s in Libertyville, Georgia.
