to fly away to Titan, a warm and fecund moon of Saturn. You will live there in safety and comfort, but in exile from your native Earth.\n\"You are going to do this voluntarily, Mr. Constant, so that the Church of God the Utterly Indifferent can have a drama of dignified self-sacrifice to remember and ponder through all time.\n\"We will imagine, to our spiritual satisfaction,\" said Rumfoord up in his treetop, \"that you are taking all mistaken ideas about the meaning of luck, all misused wealth and power, and all disgusting pastimes with you.\"\nThe man who had been Malachi Constant, who had been Unk, who had been the Space Wanderer, the man who was Malachi Constant again\u2014that man felt very little upon being declared Malachi Constant again. He might, possibly, have felt some interesting things, had Rumfoord\u2019s timing been different. But Rumfoord told him what his ordeal was to be only seconds after telling him he was Malachi Constant\u2014and the ordeal was sufficiently ghastly to command Constant\u2019s full attention.\nThe ordeal had been promised not in years or months or days\u2014but in minutes. And, like any condemned criminal, Malachi Constant became a student, to the exclusion of all else, of the apparatus on which he was about to perform.\nCuriously, his first worry was that he would stumble, that he would think too hard about the simple matter of walking, and that his feet would cease to work naturally, and that he would stumble on those wooden feet.\n\"You won\u2019t stumble, Mr. Constant,\" said Rumfoord up in his treetop, reading Constant\u2019s mind. \"There is nowhere else for you to go, nothing else for you to do. By putting one foot in front of the other, while we watch in silence, you will make of yourself the most memorable, magnificent, and meaningful human being of modern times.\"\nConstant turned to look at his dusky mate and child. Their gazes were direct. Constant learned from their gazes that Rumfoord had spoken the truth, that no course save the course to the space ship was open to him. Beatrice and young Chrono were supremely cynical about the festivities\u2014but not about courageous behavior in the midst of them.\nThey dared Malachi Constant to behave well.\nConstant rubbed his left thumb and index finger together in a careful rotary motion.

Satan didn\u2019t belong to Earl Hedlund, but he spent most of his time in Earl\u2019s woods, scaring people off the property. Earl fed him off and on, getting a cheap watchdog that way. And the dog and Earl liked each other fine besides. They both liked to make a lot of noise and act like man-eaters.\nWhen Charley drove the patrol car up the long hill to Earl\u2019s house, way off in the woods, he expected to find Earl home. It was Saturday afternoon, but Charley would have expected to find Earl home any day of the week. Earl didn\u2019t work for a living. He\u2019d inherited just enough money so he didn\u2019t have to work\u2014if he was good and stingy, and kept a sharp eye on the stock market. The busiest Earl ever got was when the newspaper came. He\u2019d turn to the financial page and make graphs of what all the stocks were doing.\nWhen Charley got up to the house, he could hear Satan barking from a long way off. And Earl wasn\u2019t around, either. The house was locked up tight, and the newspapers had piled up on the front porch.\nThe newspapers were under a brick, so they couldn\u2019t blow away. Charley counted the papers. There were four. Friday\u2019s was the top one. Saturday\u2019s hadn\u2019t come yet. It began to look as though Earl hadn\u2019t killed Estelle after all, much as he would have liked to. It looked as though Earl hadn\u2019t been around to do the job.\nCharley looked at the dates on the untouched papers, and he discovered something interesting.

Other collaborators with the Nazis, of whom there were tens of thousands in France and millions in all of Europe, had stories to tell of how they were forced to behave as badly, as they did, and of daring acts of resistance and sabotage they committed, at the risk of their lives.\nC\u00e9line found that sort of lying ludicrous in a very ugly way.\nI get a splitting headache every time I try to write about C\u00e9line. I have one now. I never have headaches at any other time.\nAs the war was ending, he headed for the center of the holocaust\u2014Berlin.\nI know when he began to influence me. I was well into my forties before I read him. A friend was startled that I didn\u2019t know anything about C\u00e9line, and he initiated me with Journey to the End of the Night, which flabbergasted me. I assigned it for a course in the novel which I was giving at the University of Iowa. When it was time for me to lecture for two hours about it, I found I had nothing to say.\nThe book penetrated my bones, anyway, if not my mind. And I only now understand what I took from C\u00e9line and put into the novel I was writing at the time, which was called Slaughterhouse-Five. In that book, I felt the need to say this every time a character died: \u2019So it goes,\u2019 This exasperated many critics, and it seemed fancy and tiresome to me, too. But it somehow had to be said.\nIt was a clumsy way of saying what C\u00e9line managed to imply so much more naturally in everything he wrote, in effect: \u201cDeath and suffering can\u2019t matter nearly as much as I think they do. Since they are so common, my taking them so seriously must mean that I am insane. I must try to be saner.\u201d\nWhich has brought us back to our old friend insanity again. C\u00e9line claimed from time to time to have been trepanned in the First World War, as the result of a head wound. Actually, according to his fascinating biographer Erika Ostrovsky (Voyeur Voyant, Random House, 1971), he was wounded in his right shoulder. And, in his final novel, Rigadoon, he tells of being hit in the head by a brick during an air raid in Hannover. So it might be said that he found it necessary sometimes to explain a head that so many people found unusual.\nHe himself must have become thoroughly sick of his head occasionally, and I will guess as to its chief defect. I think it lacked the damping apparatus which most of us have, which keeps us from being swamped by the unbelievability of life as it really is.\nSo perhaps C\u00e9line\u2019s style isn\u2019t as arbitrary as I\u2019ve thought it was. It may have been inevitable, if his mind was so undefended. There may have been nothing for him to do, as though he were caught in an artillery barrage, but to exclaim and exclaim and exclaim.", -0.060860119047619045], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["answer", 0.02830188679245283], ["meant", 0.018867924528301886], ["times", 0.018867924528301886], ["asked", 0.018867924528301886], ["feet", 0.018867924528301886], ["war", 0.018867924528301886], ["drugs", 0.018867924528301886], ["longer", 0.018867924528301886], ["buildings", 0.018867924528301886], ["serving", 0.009433962264150943], ["caused", 0.009433962264150943], ["matsumoto", 0.009433962264150943], ["executed", 0.009433962264150943], ["sown", 0.009433962264150943], ["soldiers", 0.009433962264150943], ["suicide", 0.009433962264150943], ["tv", 0.009433962264150943], ["young", 0.009433962264150943], ["crime", 0.009433962264150943], ["arrest", 0.009433962264150943], ["innocent", 0.009433962264150943], ["hiroshi", 0.009433962264150943], ["reason", 0.009433962264150943], ["criminal", 0.009433962264150943], ["fences", 0.009433962264150943], ["good", 0.009433962264150943], ["hit", 0.009433962264150943], ["loaned", 0.009433962264150943], ["mps", 0.009433962264150943], ["pavilion", 0.009433962264150943], ["federalized", 0.009433962264150943], ["hall", 0.009433962264150943], ["littlest", 0.009433962264150943], ["doorways", 0.009433962264150943], ["gun", 0.009433962264150943], ["enclosing", 0.009433962264150943], ["accompanied", 0.009433962264150943], ["parked", 0.009433962264150943], ["hard", 0.009433962264150943], ["clubs", 0.009433962264150943], ["nests", 0.009433962264150943], ["thinks", 0.009433962264150943], ["best", 0.009433962264150943], ["mines", 0.009433962264150943], ["red", 0.009433962264150943], ["told", 0.009433962264150943], ["full", 0.009433962264150943], ["pahlavi", 0.009433962264150943], ["civilians", 0.009433962264150943], ["comrade", 0.009433962264150943], ["step", 0.009433962264150943], ["soldier", 0.009433962264150943], ["misdemeanors", 0.009433962264150943], ["sidearms", 0.009433962264150943], ["erected", 0.009433962264150943], ["simply", 0.009433962264150943], ["ring", 0.009433962264150943], ["suits", 0.009433962264150943], ["troops", 0.009433962264150943], ["question", 0.009433962264150943], ["congratulated", 0.009433962264150943], ["doubt", 0.009433962264150943], ["inner", 0.009433962264150943], ["stars", 0.009433962264150943], ["today", 0.009433962264150943], ["insurrection", 0.009433962264150943], ["rockwell", 0.009433962264150943], ["coughing", 0.009433962264150943], ["depressing", 0.009433962264150943], ["terrible", 0.009433962264150943], ["reinstalled", 0.009433962264150943], ["double", 0.009433962264150943], ["will", 0.009433962264150943], ["prosecutor", 0.009433962264150943], ["general", 0.009433962264150943], ["lived", 0.009433962264150943], ["manner", 0.009433962264150943], ["sense", 0.009433962264150943], ["disembowel", 0.009433962264150943], ["orders", 0.009433962264150943], ["florio", 0.009433962264150943], ["deserve", 0.009433962264150943], ["administration", 0.009433962264150943], ["machine", 0.009433962264150943], ["recommended", 0.009433962264150943], ["ambitious", 0.009433962264150943], ["norman", 0.009433962264150943], ["fits", 0.009433962264150943], ["president", 0.009433962264150943], ["man", 0.009433962264150943], ["happening", 0.009433962264150943], ["windows", 0.009433962264150943], ["light", 0.009433962264150943], ["antipersonnel", 0.009433962264150943], ["time", 0.009433962264150943], ["pleasure", 0.009433962264150943]], "sentiment": ["The War on Drugs goes on.\nI caused 2 more fences to be erected, 1 within the other, enclosing the back of the inner buildings, and with antipersonnel mines sown in between.
