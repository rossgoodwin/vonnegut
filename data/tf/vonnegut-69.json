An outside observer might have said I exercised free will the instant it became available. But here\u2019s the thing: I had dumped a cup of very hot chicken noodle soup into my lap, and had jumped out of my chair, and was with my bare hands sweeping the scalding broth and noodles from the front of my trousers right before the timequake struck. That\u2019s what I had to be doing again at the end of the rerun.\nWhen free will kicked in, I simply kept on trying to get the soup off me before it could seep all the way through to my underwear. Trout said, quite correctly, that my actions had been reflexes, and not sufficiently creative to be considered acts of free will.\n\u201cIf you\u2019d been thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cyou would have unzipped your pants and dropped them around your ankles, since they were already soaked with soup. No amount of frenzied brushing of the surface of your pants was going to stop the soup from seeping all the way through to your underwear.\u201d\nTrout was surely among the first people in the whole wide world, and not just way-the-hell-and-gone up on West 155th Street, to realize that free will had kicked in. This was very interesting to him, as it certainly wasn\u2019t to many others. Most other people, after the relentless reprise of their mistakes and bad luck and hollow victories during the past ten years, had, in Trout\u2019s words, \u201cstopped giving a shit what was going on, or what was liable to happen next.\u201d This syndrome would eventually be given a name: Post-Timequake Apathy, or PTA.\nTrout now performed an experiment that many of us had tried to perform at the start of the rerun. He said nonsensical things on purpose, and out loud, like, \u201cBoop-boop-a-doop, dingle-dangle, artsy-fartsy, wah, wah,\u201d and so on. We all tried to say things on that order back in the second 1991, hoping to prove we could still say or do whatever we liked, if we tried hard enough. We couldn\u2019t, of course. But when Trout tried to say, \u201cBlue mink bifocals,\u201d or whatever, after the rerun, of course he could.\nNo problem!\nPeople in Europe and Africa and Asia were in darkness when free will kicked in. Most of them were in bed or sitting down somewhere. Not nearly as many of them fell down in their hemisphere as fell down in ours, where a clear majority was wide awake.\nA person walking in either hemisphere was commonly off balance, leaning in the direction he or she was going, and with most of his or her weight unevenly distributed between his or her feet.

They didn\u2019t just pretend that was what had happened to him. There was a lot of confused racist talk, evidently.

He was so theatrically absorbed by his own helplessness and worthlessness that I don\u2019t think he even noticed that his own son was all covered with ink. Nor did he ever ask me what I had just been through.\nNor did he consider the propriety of my hearing what he was determined to confess next, which was how his character had been corrupted at an early age by liquor and whores. I would never have known of the wild times he and old August Gunther used to have, when they were supposedly visiting museums and studios. Felix would never have known of them, if I hadn\u2019t told him. Mother never did know, I\u2019m sure. I certainly never told her.\nAnd that might have been bearable information for a twelve-year-old, since it had all happened so long ago.

Smith College here tonight are ardent feminists, flat heels and no makeup, preparing to beat men at their own games in the marketplace. But you know what I think?\u201d he asked with apparently profound, baritone concern. \u201cI think this is a national tragedy. Honest to God, and this kidder is not kidding this time: I think educating a woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch. Everything stops.\u201d\nHe was rewarded with an incredulous, collective gasp from the audience. It went up in the theater, as he would later declare, \u201clike a great big purple hot-air balloon.\u201d He was on a roll with political incorrectness, and he didn\u2019t stop. \u201cYou want to know what I think about the Chinese fire drill about men and women that\u2019s been going on for a million years now? Try this on for size: All women are psychotic and all men are jerks.\u201d\nThe audience was lobotomized.\nHe laughed at them. \u201cBoy, did I ever goose you. You\u2019re the goosiest bunch I\u2019ve spoken to since B\u2019nai B\u2019rith. But let me restore your dignity with a therapeutic technique I perfected while lying on my back on a craps table in the Trump Taj Mahal.\u201d What was supposed to happen next, and had happened at the University of Vermont; and then at his alma mater, Columbia; and then at Boston University, where his mom and dad met; and then Ithaca College, where Martha Jones had fallen in love with him, was this: He would coax the audience into standing up and clucking like hens who had just laid eggs.\nHe was a hypnotist.\nGil Berman said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s the end of my show, folks. You\u2019re such polite people, you\u2019re probably ready to clap your hands, whether you liked the show or not. Over the past thousand years, at least, nice people like you have been clapping for poor sons-of-bitches or daughters-of-bitches onstage, whether they really liked them or not. Slapping your palms with your palms can mean anything. It\u2019s high time we came up with a new form of applause that is optional, and that can mean only one thing: \u2018Really loved your show, no shit, no shit.\u2019 How about clucking like hens who\u2019ve just laid eggs, not that I\u2019ve laid eggs tonight. At least I hope not.\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cApplaud, please. I stand before you, having completely drained myself in order to make you happier to be alive than you were before, but you sit there like statues made of apple pan dowdy.\u201d\nSilence. Sheepishness.\nAs he had done four times before, Berman came to the apron of the stage, wiggling his fingers at the audience like a mesmerist, and intoned droningly: \u201cYou are hypnotized. You have no will of your own. You have just laid eggs. Now stand up and cluck, cluck, cluck.

Science fiction was a big help.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nRosewater said an interesting thing to Billy one time about a book that wasn\u2019t science fiction. He said that everything there was to know about life was in The Brothers Karamazov, by Feodor Dostoevsky. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t enough any more,\u201d said Rosewater.\nAnother time Billy heard Rosewater say to a psychiatrist, \u201cI think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies, or people just aren\u2019t going to want to go on living.\u201d\nThere was a still life on Billy\u2019s bedside table\u2014two pills, an ashtray with three lipstick-stained cigarettes in it, one cigarette still burning, and a glass of water. The water was dead. So it goes. Air was trying to get out of that dead water. Bubbles were clinging to the walls of the glass, too weak to climb out.\nThe cigarettes belonged to Billy\u2019s chain-smoking mother. She had sought the ladies\u2019 room, which was off the ward for WACS and WAVES and SPARS and WAFS who had gone bananas. She would be back at any moment now.\nBilly covered his head with his blanket again. He always covered his head when his mother came to see him in the mental ward\u2014always got much sicker until she went away. It wasn\u2019t that she was ugly, or had bad breath or a bad personality. She was a perfectly nice, standard-issue, brown-haired, white woman with a high-school education.\nShe upset Billy simply by being his mother. She made him feel embarrassed and ungrateful and weak because she had gone to so much trouble to give him life, and to keep that life going, and Billy didn\u2019t really like life at all.\nBilly heard Eliot Rosewater come in and lie down. Rosewater\u2019s bedsprings talked a lot about that. Rosewater was a big man, but not very powerful. He looked as though he might be made out of nose putty.\nAnd then Billy\u2019s mother came back from the ladies\u2019 room, sat down on a chair between Billy\u2019s and Rosewater\u2019s bed.

They had never used violence on anyone, and had still recruited fourteen thousand persons for Mars.\nTheir usual technique was to dress like civil engineers and offer not-quite-bright men and women nine dollars an hour, tax free, plus food and shelter and transportation, to work on a secret Government project in a remote part of the world for three years. It was a joke between Helmholtz and Miss Wiley that they had never specified what government was organizing the project, and that no recruit had ever thought to ask.\nNinety-nine per cent of the recruits were given amnesia upon arriving on Mars. Their memories were cleaned out by mental-health experts, and Martian surgeons installed radio antennas in their skulls in order that the recruits might be radio-controlled.\nAnd then the recruits were given new names in the most haphazard fashion, and were assigned to the factories, the construction gangs, the administrative staff, or to the Army of Mars.\nThe few recruits who were not treated in this way were those who demonstrated ardently that they would serve Mars heroically without being doctored at all. Those lucky few were welcomed into the secret circle of those in command.\nSecret agents Helmholtz and Wiley belonged to this circle. They were in full possession of their memories, and they were not radio-controlled. They adored their work, just as they were.\n\"What\u2019s that there Slivovitz like?\" Helmholtz asked the bartender, squinting at a dusty bottle on the bottom row.

that \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d had at least postponed Ecuador\u2019s facing up to its insoluble economic problems for a week or two. The governments of Colombia to the north and Peru to the south and east had already been overthrown, and were now military dictatorships. The new leaders of Peru, in fact, in order to divert the big brains of their people from all their troubles, were just about to declare war on Ecuador.\n\u201cIf Mrs. Onassis were to go there now,\u201d said Donoso, \u201cpeople would receive her as though she were a rescuer, a worker of miracles. She would be expected to summon ships laden with food to Guayaquil\u2014and to have United States bombers drop cereal and milk and fresh fruit for the children by parachute!\u201d\nNobody nowadays, I must say, expects to be rescued from anything, once he or she is more than nine months old. That\u2019s how long human childhood lasts nowadays.\nI myself was rescued from folly and carelessness until I was ten years old\u2014until Mother walked out on Father and me. I was on my own after that. Mary Hepburn didn\u2019t become independent of her parents until she received her master\u2019s degree at the age of twenty-two. Adolf von Kleist, the Captain of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, was regularly bailed out by his parents from gambling debts and charges of drunken driving and assault and resisting arrest and vandalism and so on until he was twenty-six\u2014when his father came down with Huntington\u2019s chorea and murdered his mother. Only then did he begin to assume responsibility for mistakes he made.\nBack when childhoods were often so protracted, it is unsurprising that so many people got into the lifelong habit of believing, even after their parents were gone, that somebody was always watching over them\u2014God or a saint or a guardian angel or the stars or whatever.\nPeople have no such illusions today. They learn very early what kind of a world this really is, and it is a rare adult indeed who hasn\u2019t seen a careless sibling or parent eaten alive by a killer whale or shark.\nA million years ago, there were passionate arguments about whether it was right or wrong for people to use mechanical means to keep sperm from fertilizing ova or to dislodge fertilized ova from uteri\u2014in order to keep the number of people from exceeding the food supply.\nThat problem is all taken care of nowadays, without anybody\u2019s having to do anything unnatural. Killer whales and sharks keep the human population nice and manageable, and nobody starves.\nMary Hepburn used to teach not only general biology at Ilium High School, but a course in human sexuality, too. This necessitated her describing various birth-control devices which she herself had never used, since her husband was the only lover she had ever had, and she and Roy had wanted to have babies from the very first.\nShe, who had failed to get pregnant despite years of profound sexual intimacies with Roy, had to admonish her students about how easy it was for a human female to get pregnant from the most fleeting, insensate, seemingly inconsequential contact with a male. And after she had been teaching a few years, most of her cautionary tales involved students she had known personally\u2014right there at Ilium High.", 0.11317919454283092], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["pomerantz", 0.020833333333333332], ["asked", 0.020833333333333332], ["cadillac", 0.020833333333333332], ["tv", 0.013888888888888888], ["dead", 0.013888888888888888], ["womblike", 0.013888888888888888], ["berman", 0.013888888888888888], ["love", 0.013888888888888888], ["three", 0.013888888888888888], ["circe", 0.013888888888888888], ["heard", 0.013888888888888888], ["life", 0.013888888888888888], ["time", 0.013888888888888888], ["replied", 0.006944444444444444], ["limited", 0.006944444444444444], ["madison", 0.006944444444444444], ["incessantly", 0.006944444444444444], ["agreed", 0.006944444444444444], ["alacrity", 0.006944444444444444], ["hell", 0.006944444444444444], ["roomy", 0.006944444444444444], ["style", 0.006944444444444444], ["pornographic", 0.006944444444444444], ["writer", 0.006944444444444444], ["young", 0.006944444444444444], ["late", 0.006944444444444444], ["heartily", 0.006944444444444444], ["east", 0.006944444444444444], ["evening", 0.006944444444444444], ["hit", 0.006944444444444444], ["watching", 0.006944444444444444], ["big", 0.006944444444444444], ["watch", 0.006944444444444444], ["sexologist", 0.006944444444444444], ["uneventful", 0.006944444444444444], ["accepted", 0.006944444444444444], ["coffinlike", 0.006944444444444444], ["day", 0.006944444444444444], ["prominent", 0.006944444444444444], ["bar", 0.006944444444444444], ["bad", 0.006944444444444444], ["stuff", 0.006944444444444444], ["delicately", 0.006944444444444444], ["talked", 0.006944444444444444], ["lecturing", 0.006944444444444444], ["nail", 0.006944444444444444], ["gangster", 0.006944444444444444], ["books", 0.006944444444444444], ["sexual", 0.006944444444444444], ["techniques", 0.006944444444444444], ["network", 0.006944444444444444], ["forty", 0.006944444444444444], ["sorts", 0.006944444444444444], ["transportation", 0.006944444444444444], ["cozy", 0.006944444444444444], ["guess", 0.006944444444444444], ["met", 0.006944444444444444], ["twentieth", 0.006944444444444444], ["making", 0.006944444444444444], ["picking", 0.006944444444444444], ["ahead", 0.006944444444444444], ["dollars", 0.006944444444444444], ["months", 0.006944444444444444], ["feasible", 0.006944444444444444], ["motion", 0.006944444444444444], ["burdensome", 0.006944444444444444], ["algonquin", 0.006944444444444444], ["bangs", 0.006944444444444444], ["afternoon", 0.006944444444444444], ["head", 0.006944444444444444], ["headed", 0.006944444444444444], ["reassure", 0.006944444444444444], ["satisfactory", 0.006944444444444444], ["lies", 0.006944444444444444], ["constant", 0.006944444444444444], ["baby", 0.006944444444444444], ["better", 0.006944444444444444], ["unexplained", 0.006944444444444444], ["casket", 0.006944444444444444], ["stretch", 0.006944444444444444], ["eleven", 0.006944444444444444], ["limousine", 0.006944444444444444], ["considerably", 0.006944444444444444], ["ceiling", 0.006944444444444444], ["form", 0.006944444444444444], ["programs", 0.006944444444444444], ["offered", 0.006944444444444444], ["hotel", 0.006944444444444444], ["sophisticated", 0.006944444444444444], ["train", 0.006944444444444444], ["atlantic", 0.006944444444444444], ["adult", 0.006944444444444444], ["catch", 0.006944444444444444], ["pieces", 0.006944444444444444], ["junior", 0.006944444444444444], ["painter", 0.006944444444444444], ["town", 0.006944444444444444], ["polly", 0.006944444444444444], ["thumps", 0.006944444444444444], ["room", 0.006944444444444444], ["ride", 0.006944444444444444], ["practically", 0.006944444444444444], ["unusually", 0.006944444444444444], ["hamptonite", 0.006944444444444444], ["proved", 0.006944444444444444], ["century", 0.006944444444444444], ["eyes", 0.006944444444444444], ["fellow", 0.006944444444444444], ["single", 0.006944444444444444], ["woman", 0.006944444444444444], ["buried", 0.006944444444444444], ["watched", 0.006944444444444444], ["breakfast", 0.006944444444444444], ["planned", 0.006944444444444444], ["novels", 0.006944444444444444], ["knew", 0.006944444444444444], ["resign", 0.006944444444444444], ["supper", 0.006944444444444444], ["rolling", 0.006944444444444444], ["president", 0.006944444444444444], ["friends", 0.006944444444444444], ["man", 0.006944444444444444], ["surprising", 0.006944444444444444], ["wife", 0.006944444444444444], ["age", 0.006944444444444444], ["spent", 0.006944444444444444], ["ocean", 0.006944444444444444], ["floyd", 0.006944444444444444]], "sentiment": ["I said that was too bad, and he heartily agreed with me.\nI didn\u2019t see anybody I knew, which was hardly surprising, since everybody I know is dead. But I made friends in the bar with a man considerably my junior, who was a writer of young adult novels, like Circe Berman. I asked him if he had ever heard of the Polly Madison books and he asked me if I had ever heard of the Atlantic Ocean.\nSo we had supper together. His wife was out of town lecturing, he said. She was a prominent sexologist.\nI asked him as delicately as I could if making love to a woman so sophisticated in sexual techniques was in any way unusually burdensome. He replied, rolling his eyes at the ceiling, that I had certainly hit the nail on the head. \u201cI have to reassure her that I really love her practically incessantly,\u201d he said.\nI spent an uneventful late evening watching pornographic TV programs in my room at the Algonquin Hotel. I watched and didn\u2019t watch at the very same time.\nI planned to catch a train back the next afternoon, but met a fellow East Hamptonite, Floyd Pomerantz, at breakfast. He, too, was headed home later in the day, and offered me a ride in his Cadillac stretch limousine. I accepted with alacrity.\nWhat a satisfactory form of transportation that proved to be! That Cadillac was better than womblike. The Twentieth Century Limited, as I have said, really was womblike, in constant motion, with all sorts of unexplained thumps and bangs outside. But the Cadillac was coffinlike. Pomerantz and I got to be dead in there. The hell with this baby stuff. It was so cozy, two of us in a single, roomy, gangster-style casket. Everybody should be buried with somebody else, just about anybody else, whenever feasible.\nPomerantz talked some about picking up the pieces of his life and trying to put them back together again.

So far so good.\nAnd if Cleveland Lawes had not offered me a ride into Atlanta, he would never have become what he is today, personnel director of the Transico Division of The RAMJAC Corporation. Transico has limousine services and taxicab fleets and car-rental agencies and parking lots and garages all over the Free World. You can even rent furniture from Transico. Many people do.\nI asked him if he thought his passengers would mind my coming along to Atlanta.\nHe said that he had never seen them before, and that he never expected to see them again\u2014that they did not work for RAMJAC. He added the piquant detail that he had not known that his chief passenger had been Virgil Greathouse until the arrival at the prison. Until that moment Greathouse had been disguised by a false beard.\nI craned my neck for a look into the backseat, and there the beard was, with one of its wire earloops hooked over a door handle.\nCleveland Lawes said as a joke that he wasn\u2019t sure Greathouse\u2019s lawyers would come back out again. \u201cWhen they were looking over the prison,\u201d he said, \u201cseemed to me they were trying it on for size.\u201d\nHe asked me if I had ever ridden in a limousine before. For simplicity\u2019s sake I told him, \u201cNo.\u201d As a child of course, I had often ridden beside my father in the front seat of Alexander Hamilton McCone\u2019s various limousines. In my youth, as I was preparing for Harvard, I had often ridden in the backseat with Mr. McCone, with a glass partition between myself and my father. The partition had not seemed strange or even suggestive to me at the time.\nAnd when in Nuremberg I had been master of that grotesque Fafner of a Mercedes touring car. But it had been an open car, freakish even without the bullet holes in the trunk lid and the rear windshield. The status it gave me among the Bavarians was that of a pirate\u2014in temporary possession of stolen goods that would certainly be restolen, again and again. But, sitting there outside the prison, I realized that I had not sat in a real limousine for perhaps forty-five years! As high as I had risen in public service, I had never been entitled to a limousine, had never been within three promotions of having one of my own or even the occasional use of one. Nor had I ever so beguiled a superior who had one that he had said to me, \u201cYoung man\u2014I want to talk to you more about this.

AS I know, she never took another drink.\nGRIOT\u2122? IN THE old days anyway, before the Koreans promised to make Parker Brothers lean and mean in Indonesia, didn\u2019t come up with the same biography every time you gave it a certain set of facts. Like life itself, it offered a variety of possibilities, spitting out endings according to what the odds for winning or losing or whatever were known to be.\nAfter GRIOT\u2122 put me on Skid Row 15 years ago, I had it try again. I did a little better, but not as well as I was doing here. It had me stay in the Army and become an instructor at West Point, but unhappy and bored. I lost my wife again, and still drank too much, and had a succession of woman friends who soon got sick of me and my depressions. And I died of cirrhosis of the liver a second time.\nGRIOT\u2122 DIDN\u2019T HAVE many alternatives to jail for the escaped convicts, though. If it came up with a parole, it soon put the ex-con back in a cage again.\nTHE SAME THING happened if GRIOT\u2122 was told that the jailbird was Hispanic. It was somewhat more optimistic about Whites, if they could read and write, and had never been in a mental hospital or been given a Dishonorable Discharge from the Armed Forces. Otherwise, they might as well be Black or Hispanic.\nTHE WILD CARDS among jailbirds, as far as GRIOT\u2122 was concerned, were Orientals and American Indians.\nWHEN THE SUPREME Court handed down its decision that prisoners should be segregated according to race, many jurisdictions did not have enough Oriental or American Indian criminals to make separate institutions for them economically feasible. Hawaii, for example, had only 2 American Indian prisoners, and Wyoming, my wife\u2019s home state, had only 1 Oriental.\nUnder such circumstances, said the Court, Indians and/or Orientals should be made honorary Whites, and treated accordingly.\nThis state has plenty of both, however, particularly after Indians began to make tax-free fortunes smuggling drugs over unmapped trails across the border from Canada. So the Indians had a prison all their own at what their ancestors used to call \u201cThunder Beaver,\u201d what we call \u201cNiagara Falls.\u201d The Orientals have their own prison at Deer Park, Long Island, conveniently located only 50 kilometers from their heroin-processing plants in New York City\u2019s Chinatown.\nWHEN YOU DARE to think about how huge the illegal drug business is in this country, you have to suspect that practically everybody has a steady buzz on, just as I did during my last 2 years in high school, and just as General Grant did during the Civil War, and just as Winston Churchill did during World War II.", 0.060638947615691795], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["plummer", 0.07], ["band", 0.05], ["helmholtz", 0.04], ["flammer", 0.03], ["instrument", 0.03], ["delaney", 0.02], ["challenge", 0.02], ["stopped", 0.02], ["rustling", 0.01], ["mind", 0.01], ["merit", 0.01], ["days", 0.01], ["high", 0.01], ["gall", 0.01], ["warning", 0.01], ["year", 0.01], ["throat", 0.01], ["close", 0.01], ["chair", 0.01], ["friday", 0.01], ["satin", 0.01], ["clarinet", 0.01], ["talking", 0.01], ["um", 0.01], ["hold", 0.01], ["sheet", 0.01], ["open", 0.01], ["challenging", 0.01], ["discrimination", 0.01], ["system", 0.01], ["noticed", 0.01], ["better", 0.01], ["genius", 0.01], ["music", 0.01], ["ambitious", 0.01], ["black", 0.01], ["man", 0.01], ["bandsman", 0.01], ["start", 0.01], ["wide", 0.01], ["hallway", 0.01], ["eyes", 0.01], ["good", 0.01], ["johnstown", 0.01], ["sword", 0.01], ["forced", 0.01], ["clicking", 0.01], ["practice", 0.01], ["june", 0.01], ["seemingly", 0.01], ["darkly", 0.01], ["running", 0.01], ["understand", 0.01], ["eyed", 0.01], ["members", 0.01], ["telling", 0.01], ["cleared", 0.01], ["spirit", 0.01], ["dare", 0.01], ["stroked", 0.01], ["case", 0.01], ["king", 0.01], ["lost", 0.01], ["held", 0.01], ["latches", 0.01], ["crowded", 0.01], ["magical", 0.01], ["hmm", 0.01], ["asked", 0.01], ["admire", 0.01], ["freshman", 0.01], ["arthur", 0.01], ["clarinetist", 0.01], ["quarters", 0.01], ["ignorant", 0.01], ["barrel", 0.01], ["voice", 0.01], ["powers", 0.01], ["possessed", 0.01], ["fact", 0.01]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI\u2019d like to challenge Flammer.\u201d\nThe rustling of sheet music and clicking of instrument case latches stopped.
