It is a pair of Victorian candlesticks\u2014not cheap, but not unbelievably expensive either. They are identical with a pair I inherited from my father. I have since given their like to each of my children, and also to the Adamses. They have become our family totem. At every family gathering, all the candlesticks are put in the middle of a table for the feast. Bring yours, too, if you\u2019re lucky enough to be invited.\nI can\u2019t come to the wedding. I have to deliver Lily (who got her own candlesticks when a neonate) to summer school in Massachusetts.\nBe Happy!\nKurt\nJune 3, 1998", 0.3229166666666667], "title": "Letters"}}
