But while I was his student I was never entrusted with knowledge of how the mental forces could be released and directed. He was unwilling to trust anyone with that information.\nI would like to point out that the term \"Barnhouse Effect\" is a creation of the popular press, and was never used by Professor Barnhouse.

There has been, only a few days before, the murder of a whore under the lamppost where SALLY stands.\nDr. Jekyll, played by JERRY, comes out of his house, the image of civic decency, and is recognized and adored by all. He is trying to get into his secret lab without being observed. While biding his time, he performs acts of civic virtue which are noted and admired by one and all. He picks up a piece of trash dropped by somebody else, puts it in a waste barrel, gives money to a beggar, politely declines an invitation from SALLY the whore, giving her a gentle lecture, and so on. KIMBERLY enters with her perambulator, and he admires the baby, chucks it under its chin. KIMBERLY exits into wings, to return, going in the opposite direction, a few minutes later.\nA fight breaks out in the pub, spills into the street. POPS rushes in to break it up. Everybody but Jekyll goes to watch. Jekyll takes the opportunity to duck into his lab.

They had no compassion for living things, but they did surprisingly little damage to property.\nDamon Stern the unicyclist, on the other hand, laid down his life for living things. They weren\u2019t even human beings. They were horses. They weren\u2019t even his horses.\nHis wife and kids got away, and, last I heard, were living in Lackawanna, where they have relatives. That\u2019s nice when people have relatives they can run away to.\nBut Damon Stern is buried deep and close to where he fell, next to the stable, in the shadow of Musket Mountain when the Sun goes down.\nHIS WIFE WANDA June came back here after the siege in a pickup truck she said belonged to her half brother. She paid a fortune for enough gas to get here from Lackawanna. I asked her what she was doing for money, and she said she and Damon had put away a lot of Yen in their freezer in a box marked \u201cBrussels sprouts.\u201d\nDamon woke her up in the middle of the night and told her to get into the Volkswagen with the kids and take off for Rochester with the headlights off. He had heard the explosion across the lake, and seen the silent army crossing the ice to Scipio. The last thing he ever did with Wanda June was hand her the box marked \u201cBrussels sprouts.\u201d\nDAMON HIMSELF, OVER his wife\u2019s objections, stayed behind to spread the alarm. He said he would be along later, by hitching a ride in somebody else\u2019s car, or by walking all the way to Rochester on back roads he knew, if he had to. It isn\u2019t clear what happened after that. He probably called the local police, although none of them lived to say so. He woke up a lot of people in the immediate neighborhood.\nThe best conjecture is that he heard gunfire inside the stable and unwisely went to investigate. A Freedom Fighter with an AK-47 was gut-shooting horses for the fun of it. He didn\u2019t shoot them in the head.\nDamon must have asked him to stop, so the Freedom Fighter shot him, too.\nHIS WIFE DIDN\u2019T want his body.
