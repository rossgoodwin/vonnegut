You just haven\u2019t had a chance to be anything or have anything because Gramps and the rest of his generation won\u2019t leave and let somebody else take over.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" said Lou gloomily. \"You can\u2019t exactly blame \u2019em, though, can you? I mean, I wonder how quick we\u2019ll knock off the anti-gerasone when we get Gramps\u2019 age.\"\n\"Sometimes I wish there wasn\u2019t any such thing as anti-gerasone!\" said Emerald passionately. \"Or I wish it was made out of something real expensive and hard-to-get instead of mud and dandelions. Sometimes I wish folks just up and died regular as clockwork, without anything to say about it, instead of deciding themselves how long they\u2019re going to stay around. There ought to be a law against selling the stuff to anybody over one hundred and fifty.\"\n\"Fat chance of that,\" said Lou, \"with all the money and votes the old people\u2019ve got.\" He looked at her closely. \"You ready to up and die, Em?\"\n\"Well, for heaven\u2019s sakes, what a thing to say to your wife. Hon! I\u2019m not even one hundred yet.\" She ran her hands lightly over her firm, youthful figure, as though for confirmation. \"The best years of my life are still ahead of me. But you can bet that when one hundred and fifty rolls around, old Em\u2019s going to pour her anti-gerasone down the sink, and quit taking up room, and she\u2019ll do it smiling.\"", 0.055122655122655115], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
