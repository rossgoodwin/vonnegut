Such pangs. I\u2019m a homesick little boy. I\u2019m on the second floor of the sort of frame house Penrod lived in. It\u2019s crazy\u2014all the land these people have, and they build their houses chockablock on teeny weeny lots. Maybe they\u2019re sick of land. There are alleys everywhere. I had forgotten how romantic alleys are. My apartment is like this:\nI like the apartment better each day. It\u2019s friendlier than I thought\u2014a nice, soft old shoe. I work well in it. I\u2019ve already managed to send off a big part of the Rosewater treatment to Harrison. That whole package, which is more a complete scenario than a treatment, should be finished in ten more days. It should be worth some money to us. It\u2019s full of brand new Rosewater lines and situations\u2014had to be, since a book is a book and a film is a film. It\u2019s kind of a sequel.\nI will tell you what I really like: the looks and the feel of this town. The university is right in the middle of it, and the town exists only because of the university. The idea is medieval and exciting and beautiful. Dexter [Leon] would faint for joy. Give him my love, by the way. I can and do walk to all the stores and to work. The Unitarian church is a block away, and I went last Sunday. It\u2019s a great club.\nI don\u2019t make my professorial debut until tomorrow afternoon. All that\u2019s going on now is registration. I have yet to make new friends. I\u2019m a laggard that way.

which could be spoken in polite company, provided the speaker\u2019s tone implied fear and loathing, was Communism, denoting an activity as commonly and innocently practiced in many primitive societies as fucking.\nSo it was a particularly elegant commentary on the patriotism and nice-nellyism during the deliberately insane Vietnam War when the satirist Paul Krassner printed red-white-and-blue bumper stickers that said FUCK COMMUNISM!\nMy novel Slaughterhouse-Five was attacked back then for containing the word motherfucker. In an early episode, somebody takes a shot at four American soldiers caught behind the German lines.

From the fields there comes the breath of new-mown hay.\n\u201cWhile there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\u201d\nThe Great Depression was a time for discussing all sorts of alternatives to the Wall Street crapshoot, which had suddenly killed so many businesses, including banks.

There wasn\u2019t even a handkerchief or a washcloth in there. Thus was he having his first taste of a textile shortage, which at the moment seemed merely inconvenient, but which would be acute during the thirty years of life still ahead of him. Cloth to protect his skin from sunburn in the daytime and from chills at night simply would not be available anymore. How he and the rest of the first colonists would come to envy Hisako\u2019s daughter Akiko for her coat of fur!\nEverybody but Akiko, until Akiko herself had furry babies, would in the daytime have to wear fragile capes and hats made of feathers tied together with fish guts.\nQuoth Mandarax to the contrary:\nMan is a biped without feathers.\n\u2014PLATO (427?\u2013347 B.C.)\nThe Captain remained calm as he searched his cabin. The shower in the head was dripping, and he turned it off tight. That much he could make right, anyway. That was how composed he was. As I have already said, his digestive system still had food to process. Even more important to his peace of mind, though, was that nobody was counting on him for anything. Those who had looted the ship almost all had numerous relatives in dire need, who were starting to roll their eyes and pat their bellies and point down their throats like the Kanka-bono girls.\nThe Captain was still in possession of his famous sense of humor, and freer than ever to indulge it. For whose sake was he now to pretend that life was a serious matter? There weren\u2019t even rats left on the ship. There had never been rats on the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, which was another lucky break for humankind. If rats had come ashore with the first human settlers on Santa Rosalia, there would have been nothing left for people to eat in six months or so.\nAnd then, after that, the rats, after having eaten what was left of the people and each other, would themselves have died.\nQuoth Mandarax:\nRats!", 0.13415270429159318], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["hit", 0.025806451612903226], ["hands", 0.025806451612903226], ["museum", 0.025806451612903226], ["gregory", 0.025806451612903226], ["modern", 0.025806451612903226], ["art", 0.01935483870967742], ["marilee", 0.01935483870967742], ["caught", 0.01935483870967742], ["holding", 0.01935483870967742], ["papa", 0.01935483870967742], ["versus", 0.012903225806451613], ["dan", 0.012903225806451613], ["jack", 0.012903225806451613], ["front", 0.012903225806451613], ["jill", 0.012903225806451613], ["confrontation", 0.012903225806451613], ["love", 0.012903225806451613], ["loyalty", 0.012903225806451613], ["stay", 0.012903225806451613], ["moments", 0.0064516129032258064], ["pointed", 0.0064516129032258064], ["course", 0.0064516129032258064], ["gang", 0.0064516129032258064], ["slow", 0.0064516129032258064], ["hadn", 0.0064516129032258064], ["startled", 0.0064516129032258064], ["skipping", 0.0064516129032258064], ["balled", 0.0064516129032258064], ["planted", 0.0064516129032258064], ["forbidden", 0.0064516129032258064], ["realize", 0.0064516129032258064], ["apart", 0.0064516129032258064], ["easily", 0.0064516129032258064], ["shouted", 0.0064516129032258064], ["rage", 0.0064516129032258064], ["oddly", 0.0064516129032258064], ["side", 0.0064516129032258064], ["crowd", 0.0064516129032258064], ["people", 0.0064516129032258064], ["house", 0.0064516129032258064], ["sex", 0.0064516129032258064], ["born", 0.0064516129032258064], ["excitement", 0.0064516129032258064], ["lovers", 0.0064516129032258064], ["pictures", 0.0064516129032258064], ["celebrated", 0.0064516129032258064], ["novelty", 0.0064516129032258064], ["someplace", 0.0064516129032258064], ["rotten", 0.0064516129032258064], ["finger", 0.0064516129032258064], ["told", 0.0064516129032258064], ["power", 0.0064516129032258064], ["apartment", 0.0064516129032258064], ["choked", 0.0064516129032258064], ["spoke", 0.0064516129032258064], ["kids", 0.0064516129032258064], ["moment", 0.0064516129032258064], ["thing", 0.0064516129032258064], ["masterpiece", 0.0064516129032258064], ["afternoon", 0.0064516129032258064], ["styles", 0.0064516129032258064], ["expression", 0.0064516129032258064], ["asked", 0.0064516129032258064], ["genuinely", 0.0064516129032258064], ["conclude", 0.0064516129032258064], ["simple", 0.0064516129032258064], ["symbolic", 0.0064516129032258064], ["feet", 0.0064516129032258064], ["agreed", 0.0064516129032258064], ["clambered", 0.0064516129032258064], ["thought", 0.0064516129032258064], ["complied", 0.0064516129032258064], ["nowadays", 0.0064516129032258064], ["gratitude", 0.0064516129032258064], ["story", 0.0064516129032258064], ["wealth", 0.0064516129032258064], ["doubt", 0.0064516129032258064], ["time", 0.0064516129032258064], ["war", 0.0064516129032258064], ["loving", 0.0064516129032258064], ["head", 0.0064516129032258064], ["door", 0.0064516129032258064], ["painted", 0.0064516129032258064], ["going", 0.0064516129032258064], ["hotel", 0.0064516129032258064], ["proving", 0.0064516129032258064], ["understand", 0.0064516129032258064], ["seethed", 0.0064516129032258064], ["parasites", 0.0064516129032258064], ["stolen", 0.0064516129032258064], ["heard", 0.0064516129032258064], ["car", 0.0064516129032258064], ["youth", 0.0064516129032258064], ["ingrates", 0.0064516129032258064], ["spoiled", 0.0064516129032258064], ["fun", 0.0064516129032258064], ["called", 0.0064516129032258064], ["shook", 0.0064516129032258064], ["control", 0.0064516129032258064], ["fists", 0.0064516129032258064], ["indicated", 0.0064516129032258064], ["accept", 0.0064516129032258064], ["pushed", 0.0064516129032258064], ["alike", 0.0064516129032258064], ["physical", 0.0064516129032258064], ["looked", 0.0064516129032258064], ["afraid", 0.0064516129032258064], ["junk", 0.0064516129032258064], ["attractiveness", 0.0064516129032258064], ["knew", 0.0064516129032258064], ["modest", 0.0064516129032258064], ["coming", 0.0064516129032258064], ["changes", 0.0064516129032258064], ["age", 0.0064516129032258064], ["request", 0.0064516129032258064], ["trembling", 0.0064516129032258064], ["beds", 0.0064516129032258064], ["lovemaking", 0.0064516129032258064], ["literally", 0.0064516129032258064], ["painting", 0.0064516129032258064], ["talk", 0.0064516129032258064]], "sentiment": ["Gregory pointed a finger at us. He was trembling with rage. \u201cCaught you!\u201d he shouted. \u201cStay right there! I want to talk to you!\u201d\nHe clambered over the car door, pushed his way through the crowd and planted himself in front of us, his feet far apart, his hands balled into fists. He had often hit Marilee, but he had certainly never hit me. Oddly enough, nobody had ever hit me. Nobody has ever hit me.\nSex was the cause of our excitement: youth versus age, wealth and power versus physical attractiveness, stolen moments of forbidden fun and so on\u2014but Gregory spoke only of gratitude, loyalty and modern art.\nAs for the pictures in the museum\u2019s being genuinely modern: most of them had been painted before the First World War, before Marilee and I had been born! The world back then was very slow to accept changes in painting styles. Nowadays, of course, every novelty is celebrated immediately as a masterpiece!\n\u201cYou parasites! You ingrates! You rotten-spoiled little kids!\u201d seethed Dan Gregory. \u201cYour loving Papa asked just one thing of you as an expression of your loyalty: \u2018Never go into the Museum of Modern Art.\u2019\u201d\nI doubt that many people who heard him even knew that we were in front of a museum. They probably thought he had caught us coming out of a hotel or an apartment house\u2014someplace with beds for lovers. If they took him literally when he called himself a \u201cPapa,\u201d they would have had to conclude that he was my Papa and not hers, since we looked so much alike.\n\u201cIt was symbolic!\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand that? It was a way of proving you were on my side and not theirs. I\u2019m not afraid to have you look at the junk in there. You were part of my gang, and proud of it.\u201d He was all choked up now, and he shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made that very simple, very modest, very easily complied-with request: \u2018Stay out of the Museum of Modern Art.\u2019\u201d\nMarilee and I were so startled by this confrontation, we may even have gone on holding hands. We had come skipping out and holding hands like Jack and Jill.

club dinghy, scree-scraw, scree-scraw, with three inches of freeboard all around. And he would transfer his bulk to Rosebud II, and lie down in the cockpit, out of sight, with his head on an orange lifejacket. He would listen to the lapping of the water, the clinking and creaking of the rigging, put one hand on his genitals, feel at one with God, go to sleepy-bye. That much was lovely.\nThe Buntlines had a young upstairs maid named Selena Deal, who knew Fred's secret. One little window in her bedroom looked out on the fleet. When she sat on her narrow bed and wrote, as she was doing now, her window framed the Rosebud II. Her door was ajar, so she could hear the telephone ring. That was all she had to do during the afternoons, usually\u2014 answer the telephone in case it rang. It seldom rang, and, as Selena asked herself, \"Why would it?\"\nShe was eighteen years old. She was an orphan from an orphanage that had been founded by the Buntline family in Pawtucket in 1878. When it was founded, the Buntlines required three things: That all orphans be raised as Christians, regardless of race, color, or creed, that they take an oath once a week, before Sunday supper, and that, each year, an intelligent, clean female orphan enter domestic service in a Buntline home, ... in order to learn about the better things in life, and perhaps to be inspired to climb a few rungs of the ladder of culture and social grace.\nThe oath, which Selena had taken six hundred times, before six hundred very plain suppers, went like this, and was written by Castor Buntline, poor old Stewart's great-grandfather:\nI do solemnly swear that I will respect the sacred private property of others, and that I will be content with whatever station in life God Almighty may assign me to. I will be grateful to those who employ me, and will never complain about wages and hours, but will ask myself instead, \"What more can I do for my employer, my republic, and my God?\" I understand that I have not been placed on Earth to be happy. I am here to be tested. If I am to pass the test, I must be always unselfish, always sober, always truthful, always chaste in mind, body, and deed, and always respectful to those to whom God has, in His Wisdom, placed above me. If I pass the test, I will go to joy everlasting in Heaven when I die. If I fail, I shall roast in hell while the Devil laughs and Jesus weeps.\nSelena, a pretty girl who played the piano beautifully and wanted to be a nurse, was writing to the head of the orphanage, a man named Wilfred Parrot. Parrot was sixty. He had done a lot of interesting things in his life, such as fighting in Spain in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and, from 1933 until 1936, writing a radio serial called \"Beyond the Blue Horizon.\" He ran a happy orphanage. All of the children called him \"Daddy,\" and all of the children could cook and dance and play some musical instrument and paint.\nSelena had been with the Buntlines a month. She was supposed to stay a year. This is what she wrote:\nDear Daddy Parrot: Maybe things will get better here, but I don't see how. Mrs. Buntline and I don't get along very well. She keeps saying I am ungrateful and impertinent. I don't mean to be, but I guess maybe I am. I just hope she doesn't get so mad at me she turns against the orphanage. That is the big thing I worry about. I am just going to have to try harder to obey the oath. What goes wrong all the time is things she sees in my eyes. I can't keep those things out of my eyes. She says something or does something I think is kind of dumb or pitiful or something, and I don't say anything about it, but she looks in my eyes and gets very mad. One time she told me that music was the most important thing in her life, next to her husband and her daughter. They have loudspeakers all over the house, all connected to a big phonograph in the front coat closet. There is music all day long, and Mrs. Buntline said what she enjoyed more than anything was picking out a musical program at the start of every day, and loading it into the record changer. This morning there was music coming out of all the loudspeakers, and it didn't sound like any music I had ever heard before. It was very high and fast and twittery, and Mrs. Buntline was humming along with it, rocking her head from side to side to show me how much she loved it. It was driving me crazy. And then her best friend, a woman named Mrs. Rosewater, came over, and she said how much she loved the music, too. She said someday, when her ship came in, she would have beautiful music all the time, too. I finally broke down and asked Mrs. Buntline what on earth it was. \"Why, my dear child,\" she said, \"that is none other than the immortal Beethoven.\" \"Beethoven!\" I said. \"Have you ever heard of him before?\" she said. \"Yes, mam, I have. Daddy Parrot played Beethoven all the time back at the orphanage, but it didn't sound like that.\" So she took me in where the phonograph was, and she said, \"Very well, I will prove it is Beethoven. I have loaded the changer with nothing but Beethoven. Every so often I just go on a Beethoven binge.\" \"I just adore Beethoven, too,\" Mrs. Rosewater said. Mrs. Buntline told me to look at what was in the record changer and tell her whether it was Beethoven or not. It was. She had loaded the changer with all nine symphonies, but that poor woman had them playing at 78 revolutions per minute instead of 33, and she couldn't tell the difference. I told her about it, Daddy. I had to tell her, didn't I? I was very polite, but I must have gotten that look in my eyes, because she got very mad, and she made me go out and clean up the chauffeur's lavatory in the back of the garage. Actually, it wasn't a very dirty job. They haven't had a chauffeur for years.\nAnother time, Daddy, she took me out to watch a sailboat race in Mr. Buntline's big motorboat. I asked to go. I said all anybody ever seemed to talk about in Pisquontuit was sailboat races. I said I would like to see what was so wonderful about them. Her daughter Lila was racing that day. Lila is the best sailer in town. You should see all the cups she has won. They are the main decorations of the house. There aren't any pictures to speak of A neighbor has a Picasso, but I heard him say he would a lot rather have a daughter who could sail like Lila. I don't think it makes much difference one way or another, but I didn't say so. Believe me, Daddy, I don't say half the things I could. Anyway, we went out to see this sailboat race, and I wish you could have heard the way Mrs. Buntline yelled and swore. You remember the things Arthur Gonsalves used to say? Mrs. Buntline used words that would have been news to Arthur. I never saw a woman get so excited and mad. She just forgot I was there. She looked like a witch with the rabies. You would have thought the fate of the universe was being decided by those sunburned children in those pretty little white boats. She finally remembered me, and she realized she had said some things that didn't sound very good. \"You've got to understand why we're all so excited right now,\" she said. \"Lila has two legs on the Commodore's Cup.\" \"Oh,\" I said, \"that explains everything.\" I swear, Daddy, that's all I said, but there must have been that look in my eyes.\nWhat gets me most about these people, Daddy, isn't how ignorant they are, or how much they drink. It's the way they have of thinking that everything nice in the world is a gift to the poor people from them or their ancestors. The first afternoon I was here, Mrs. Buntline made me come out on the back porch and look at the sunset. So I did, and I said I liked it very much, but she kept waiting for me to say something else. I couldn't think of what else I was supposed to say, so I said what seemed liked a dumb thing. \"Thank you very much,\" I said. That was exactly what she was waiting for. \"You're entirely welcome,\" she said. I have since thanked her for the ocean, the moon, the stars in the sky, and the United States Constitution.", 0.15375207279492992], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["wealth", 0.11764705882352941], ["material", 0.11764705882352941], ["beautiful", 0.058823529411764705], ["ago", 0.058823529411764705], ["staying", 0.058823529411764705], ["torn", 0.058823529411764705], ["hotel", 0.058823529411764705], ["years", 0.058823529411764705], ["thought", 0.058823529411764705], ["forward", 0.058823529411764705], ["suppose", 0.058823529411764705], ["supper", 0.058823529411764705], ["hear", 0.058823529411764705], ["arapahoe", 0.058823529411764705], ["sounds", 0.058823529411764705]], "sentiment": ["\u201cIt sounds very beautiful,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe would be proud to have you see it,\u201d he said. \u201cCould you come to supper sometime?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014I suppose,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe Hotel Arapahoe,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI thought they\u2019d torn that down years ago,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear from us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAs you\u2019ll see,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have nothing in the way of material wealth; but we need nothing in the way of material wealth.\u201d", 0.2814814814814815], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["johnson", 0.04807692307692308], ["mccabe", 0.028846153846153848], ["schooner", 0.019230769230769232], ["miami", 0.019230769230769232], ["ashore", 0.019230769230769232], ["bokonon", 0.009615384615384616], ["managed", 0.009615384615384616], ["tobago", 0.009615384615384616], ["years", 0.009615384615384616], ["prince", 0.009615384615384616], ["hounded", 0.009615384615384616], ["lorenzo", 0.009615384615384616], ["swim", 0.009615384615384616], ["seeking", 0.009615384615384616], ["term", 0.009615384615384616], ["haiti", 0.009615384615384616], ["lady", 0.009615384615384616], ["earl", 0.009615384615384616], ["recreation", 0.009615384615384616], ["arrested", 0.009615384615384616], ["rocks", 0.009615384615384616], ["naked", 0.009615384615384616], ["harbor", 0.009615384615384616], ["gandhi", 0.009615384615384616], ["wonders", 0.009615384615384616], ["set", 0.009615384615384616], ["absolutely", 0.009615384615384616], ["fish", 0.009615384615384616], ["crown", 0.009615384615384616], ["1922", 0.009615384615384616], ["sea", 0.009615384615384616], ["sailed", 0.009615384615384616], ["port", 0.009615384615384616], ["voyage", 0.009615384615384616], ["caribbean", 0.009615384615384616], ["destiny", 0.009615384615384616], ["sail", 0.009615384615384616], ["hurricane", 0.009615384615384616], ["fog", 0.009615384615384616], ["transportation", 0.009615384615384616], ["approached", 0.009615384615384616], ["idealistic", 0.009615384615384616], ["scheherazade", 0.009615384615384616], ["tracks", 0.009615384615384616], ["groups", 0.009615384615384616], ["marine", 0.009615384615384616], ["brilliant", 0.009615384615384616], ["country", 0.009615384615384616], ["dollars", 0.009615384615384616], ["british", 0.009615384615384616], ["shipped", 0.009615384615384616], ["expense", 0.009615384615384616], ["named", 0.009615384615384616], ["railroad", 0.009615384615384616], ["slipper", 0.009615384615384616], ["follower", 0.009615384615384616], ["mohandas", 0.009615384615384616], ["bombay", 0.009615384615384616], ["boat", 0.009615384615384616], ["corporal", 0.009615384615384616], ["leading", 0.009615384615384616], ["angry", 0.009615384615384616], ["storm", 0.009615384615384616], ["educated", 0.009615384615384616], ["rammed", 0.009615384615384616], ["offered", 0.009615384615384616], ["fund", 0.009615384615384616], ["survived", 0.009615384615384616], ["pitched", 0.009615384615384616], ["ii", 0.009615384615384616], ["stolen", 0.009615384615384616], ["unmistakably", 0.009615384615384616], ["marines", 0.009615384615384616], ["called", 0.009615384615384616], ["san", 0.009615384615384616], ["india", 0.009615384615384616], ["states", 0.009615384615384616], ["gale", 0.009615384615384616], ["au", 0.009615384615384616], ["idler", 0.009615384615384616], ["reports", 0.009615384615384616], ["sought", 0.009615384615384616], ["occupied", 0.009615384615384616], ["protested", 0.009615384615384616], ["built", 0.009615384615384616], ["stayed", 0.009615384615384616], ["company", 0.009615384615384616], ["shelter", 0.009615384615384616], ["united", 0.009615384615384616], ["adventure", 0.009615384615384616], ["deserter", 0.009615384615384616], ["drive", 0.009615384615384616], ["rule", 0.009615384615384616], ["jail", 0.009615384615384616], ["lying", 0.009615384615384616]], "sentiment": ["Johnson saw many wonders of the world on the voyage.\nThe Scheherazade was rammed in a fog in Bombay harbor, and only Johnson survived.

George\u2019s soul, maybe?\nWell, Army Intelligence smelled something fishy about the story quick enough. At Camp Lucky Strike, near Le Havre, France, where they had all of the repatriated prisoners of war waiting for boats home, I got called into a tent Intelligence had set up there. I\u2019d been in camp for two weeks, and was due to ship out the next afternoon.\nA gray-haired major asked the questions. He had the affidavit in front of him, and he passed over the story about the pistol in the ditch without showing much interest. He quizzed me for quite a while about how George had behaved in prison camp, and he wanted to know exactly what George looked like. He took notes on what I told him.\n\u201cSure you have the name right?\u201d he asked.", 0.06190476190476191], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
