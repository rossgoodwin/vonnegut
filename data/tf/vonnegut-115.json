The self-respects of most middle-class American people my age or older, and still alive, are out to pasture now, not a bad place to be. They munch. They ruminate.\nIf self-respect breaks a leg, the leg can never heal. Its owner has to shoot it. My mother and Ernest Hemingway and my former literary agent and Jerzy Kosinski and my reluctant thesis advisor at the University of Chicago and Eva Braun all come to mind.\nBut not Kilgore Trout. His indestructible self-respect is what I loved most about Kilgore Trout. Men loving men can happen, in peacetime as well as war. I also loved my war buddy Bernard V. O\u2019Hare.\nMany people fail because their brains, their three-and-a-half-pound blood-soaked sponges, their dogs\u2019 breakfasts, don\u2019t work well enough.

I\u2019m dumb, I\u2019m dumb.\u201d\nPut this in your pipe and smoke it: My maternal great-uncle Carl Barus was a founder and president of the American Physical Society. A building at Brown University is named in his honor. Uncle Carl Barus was a professor there for many years. I never met him. My big brother did. Until this summer of 1996, Bernie and I had thought of him as a serene contributor to modest but tidy increases in human understanding of the laws of Nature.\nLast June, though, I asked Bernie to tell me some specific discoveries, however small, made by our distinguished great-uncle, whose genes Bernie had inherited so outstandingly. Bernie\u2019s response was anything but schnip-schnop, anything but prompt. Bernie was bemused to realize at such a late date that Uncle Carl, while making a career in physics attractive, had never told him about anything he himself had accomplished.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to

him when the game begins\u2014Pi Ying and his friend, Major Barzov.\" He raised his eyebrows. \"The major claims to be sorry that, in his capacity as a military observer for the Russian army, he is powerless to intervene in our behalf. He also says we have his sympathy. I suspect he\u2019s a damn liar on both counts. Pi Ying is scared stiff of him.\"\n\"We get to watch the game?\" whispered the corporal tensely.\n\"The sixteen of us, soldier, are the chessmen I\u2019ll be playing with.\"\nThe door swung open....\n\"Can you see the whole board from down there, White King?\" called Pi Ying cheerfully from a balcony overlooking the azure-domed chamber. He was smiling down at Colonel Bryan Kelly, his family, and his men. \"You must be the White King, you know. Otherwise, we couldn\u2019t be sure that you\u2019d be with us for the whole game.\" The guerrilla chief\u2019s face was flushed. His smile was one of mock solicitousness. \"Delighted to see all of you!\"\nTo Pi Ying\u2019s right, indistinct in the shadows, stood Major Barzov, the taciturn Russian military observer. He acknowledged Kelly\u2019s stare with a slow nod. Kelly continued to stare fixedly. The arrogant, bristle-haired major became restless, folding and unfolding his arms, repeatedly rocking back and forth in his black boots. \"I wish I could help you,\" he said at last. It wasn\u2019t an amenity but a contemptuous jest. \"I am only an observer here.\" Barzov said it heavily. \"I wish you luck, Colonel,\" he added, and turned his back.\nSeated on Pi Ying\u2019s left was a delicate young Oriental woman. She gazed expressionlessly at the wall over the Americans\u2019 heads. She and Barzov had been present when Pi Ying had first told Colonel Kelly of the game he wanted to play. When Kelly had begged Pi Ying to leave his wife and children out of it, he had thought he saw a spark of pity in her eyes. As he looked up at the motionless, ornamental girl now, he knew he must have been mistaken.\n\"This room was a whim of my predecessors, who for generations held the people in slavery,\" said Pi Ying sententiously. \"It served nicely as a throne room. But the floor is inlaid with squares, sixty-four of them \u2014a chessboard, you see? The former tenants had those handsome, man-sized chessmen before you built so that they and their friends could sit up here and order servants to move them about.\" He twisted a ring on his finger. \"Imaginative as that was, it remained for us to hit upon this new twist. Today, of course, we will use only the black chessmen, my pieces.\" He turned to the restive Major Barzov. \"The Americans have furnished their own chessmen. Fascinating idea.\" His smile faded when he saw that Barzov wasn\u2019t smiling with him. Pi Ying seemed eager to please the Russian. Barzov, in turn, appeared to regard Pi Ying as hardly worth listening to.\nThe twelve American soldiers stood against a wall under heavy guard. Instinctively, they bunched together and glared sullenly at their patronizing host. \"Take it easy,\" said Colonel Kelly, \"or we\u2019ll lose the one chance we\u2019ve got.\" He looked quickly at his twin sons, Jerry and Paul, who gazed about the room, unruffled, interested, blinking sleepily at the side of their stunned mother. Kelly wondered why he felt so little as he watched his family in the face of death. The fear he had felt while they were waiting in their dark prison was gone. Now he recognized the eerie calm\u2014an old wartime friend\u2014that left only the cold machinery of his wits and senses alive. It was the narcotic of generalship. It was the essence of war.\n\"Now, my friends, your attention,\" said Pi Ying importantly. He stood. \"The rules of the game are easy to remember. You are all to behave as Colonel Kelly tells you. Those of you who are so unfortunate as to be taken by one of my chessmen will be killed quickly, painlessly, promptly.\" Major Barzov looked at the ceiling as though he were inwardly criticizing everything Pi Ying said.", 0.023366417938786365], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["felix", 0.20833333333333334], ["genevieve", 0.20833333333333334], ["love", 0.125], ["boy", 0.041666666666666664], ["guess", 0.041666666666666664], ["good", 0.041666666666666664], ["cry", 0.041666666666666664], ["won", 0.041666666666666664], ["better", 0.041666666666666664], ["going", 0.041666666666666664], ["mother", 0.041666666666666664], ["girl", 0.041666666666666664], ["walk", 0.041666666666666664], ["best", 0.041666666666666664]], "sentiment": ["FELIX: Why not?\nGENEVIEVE: DO you really think I would make a good mother?\nFELIX: The best.\nGENEVIEVE: What would you want\u2014a boy or a girl?\nFELIX: Either one.

The title is an acknowledgment of the fact that most people can\u2019t read, or, in any event, don\u2019t enjoy it much.\n\u201cReading is such a difficult thing to do that most of our time in school is spent learning how to do that alone. If we had spent as much time at ice skating as we have with reading, we would all be stars with the Hollywood Ice Capades instead of bookworms now.\n\u201cAs you know, it isn\u2019t enough for a reader to pick up the little symbols from a page with his eyes, or, as is the case with a blind person, with his fingertips. Once we get those symbols inside our heads and in the proper order, then we must clothe them in gloom or joy or apathy, in love or hate, in anger or peacefulness, or however the author intended them to be clothed. In order to be good readers, we must even recognize irony\u2014which is when a writer says one thing and really means another, contradicting himself in what he believes to be a beguiling cause.\n\u201cWe even have to get jokes! God help us if we miss a joke.\n\u201cSo most people give up on reading.\n\u201cSo\u2014for all the jubilation this new library will generate in the community at large, this building might as well be a noodle, factory. Noodles are okay. Libraries are okay. They are rather neutral good news.\n\u201cPerhaps the central concept of this beautifully organized speech will enter the patois of Connecticut College.\n\u201cOne student may say to another, \u2019You want to go out and drink some beer?\u2019\n\u201cThe other might reply: \u2019No. I\u2019m about to flunk out, they tell me.

An advertising agency on another planet had a successful campaign for the local equivalent of Earthling peanut butter. The eye-catching part of each ad was the statement of some sort of average\u2014the average number of children, the average size of the male sex organ on that particular planet\u2014which was two inches long, with an inside diameter of three inches and an outside diameter of four and a quarter inches\u2014and so on. The ads invited the readers to discover whether they were superior or inferior to the majority, in this respect or that one\u2014whatever the respect was for that particular ad.\nThe ad went on to say that superior and inferior people alike ate such and such brand of peanut butter. Except that it wasn\u2019t really peanut butter on that planet. It was Shazzbutter.\nAnd so on.\n16\nAND THE PEANUT BUTTER-EATERS on Earth were preparing to conquer the shazzbutter-eaters on the planet in the book by Kilgore Trout. By this time, the Earthlings hadn\u2019t just demolished West Virginia and Southeast Asia. They had demolished everything. So they were ready to go pioneering again.\nThey studied the shazzbutter-eaters by means of electronic snooping, and determined that they were too numerous and proud and resourceful ever to allow themselves to be pioneered.\nSo the Earthlings infiltrated the ad agency which had the shazzbutter account, and they buggered the statistics in the ads. They made the average for everything so high that everybody on the planet felt inferior to the majority in every respect.\nAnd then the Earthling armored space ships came in and discovered the planet. Only token resistance was offered here and there, because the natives felt so below average. And then the pioneering began.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTrout asked the happy manufacturer\u2019s representative what it felt like to drive a Galaxie, which was the name of the car. The driver didn\u2019t hear him, and Trout let it go. It was a dumb play on words, so that Trout was asking simultaneously what it was like to drive the car and what it was like to steer something like the Milky Way, which was one hundred thousand light-years in diameter and ten thousand light-years thick.
