So there are bound to be clinkers\u2014maybe nothing but clinkers for the rest of my days. But I am hopeful.\nThe news of your impending departure from the Post is going to break plenty of hearts in the writing profession. I just gave the news to Vance Bourjaily, and he cursed and moaned some. That you unselfishly busted your ass on behalf of good writing is widely known, and I will make it even more widely known this afternoon, when I meet with a class of sixty-five. I am trying to give my course strong undertones of sociological realism, making my students think hard about not only what stories and authors are, but what audiences are, too.\nI have sniffed around a little, and there is every indication that you would be most welcome here. I think the presence of a first-rate editor would round out the staff handsomely. I gather that all the money has been spent for the coming academic year, so the possibility of your being taken on before next September is slim\u2014but not invisible. I suggest that you write Paul Engle at 724 Bayard Street, if you\u2019re at all serious. He is the man who can find extra money right now, if he really wants to, or make a spot next September absolutely firm. You had better write him immediately, though, because he\u2019s leaving for nine months in Europe a couple of weeks from now.\nYou\u2019d like it here. Really. It\u2019s cozy.\nKurt\nSeptember 30, 1965\n[Iowa City]", 0.08818889443889444], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["father", 0.026200873362445413], ["extended", 0.017467248908296942],

He drew pictures of absurdly complex and undependable machines, employing treadmills and trapdoors and bells and whistles, and domestic animals in harness and blowtorches and mailmen and light bulbs, and firecrackers and mirrors and radios and Victrolas, and pistols firing blank cartridges, and so on, in order to accomplish some simple task, such as closing a window blind.\nYes, and Trout harped on the human need for extended families, and I still do, because it is so obvious that we, because we are human, need them as much as we need proteins and carbohydrates and fats and vitamins and essential minerals.\nI have just read about a teenage father who shook his baby to death because it couldn\u2019t control its anal sphincter yet and wouldn\u2019t stop crying. In an extended family, there would have been other people around, who would have rescued and comforted the baby, and the father, too.\nIf the father had been raised in an extended family, he might not have been such an awful father, or maybe not a father at all yet, because he was still too young to be a good one, or because he was too crazy to ever be a good one.\nI was in southern Nigeria in 1970, at the very end of the Biafran War there, on the Biafran side, the losing side, the mostly Ibo side, long before the rerun. I met an Ibo father of a new baby. He had four hundred relatives! Even with a losing war going on, he and his wife were about to go on a trip, introducing the baby to all its relatives.\nWhen the Biafran army needed replacements, big Ibo families met to decide who should go. In peacetime, the families met to decide who should go to college, often to Cal Tech or Oxford or Harvard, a long way off. And then a whole family chipped in to pay for the travel and tuition and clothing suitable for the climate and dominant society where a kid was going next.\nI met the Ibo writer Chinua Achebe over there. He is teaching and writing at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, 12504, over here now. I asked him how the Ibos were now, with Nigeria run by a rapacious junta which regularly hangs its critics for having much too much free will.\nChinua said no Ibos had roles in the government, nor did they want any. He said Ibos survived in modest businesses unlikely to bring them into conflict with the government or its friends, which included representatives of Shell Oil Company.", 0.038372859025032936], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["fuller", 0.05154639175257732], ["susanna", 0.05154639175257732], ["girl", 0.041237113402061855], ["chance", 0.041237113402061855], ["changed", 0.020618556701030927], ["turned", 0.020618556701030927], ["walk", 0.020618556701030927], ["human", 0.020618556701030927], ["wicked", 0.020618556701030927], ["looked", 0.020618556701030927], ["race", 0.020618556701030927], ["wonderingly", 0.010309278350515464], ["ordered", 0.010309278350515464], ["korea", 0.010309278350515464], ["feel", 0.010309278350515464], ["sweet", 0.010309278350515464], ["told", 0.010309278350515464], ["trunk", 0.010309278350515464], ["bring", 0.010309278350515464], ["street", 0.010309278350515464], ["called", 0.010309278350515464], ["village", 0.010309278350515464], ["bucks", 0.010309278350515464], ["shrugged", 0.010309278350515464], ["better", 0.010309278350515464], ["nights", 0.010309278350515464], ["opened", 0.010309278350515464], ["rubbed", 0.010309278350515464], ["floor", 0.010309278350515464], ["twenty", 0.010309278350515464], ["watching", 0.010309278350515464], ["girls", 0.010309278350515464], ["arms", 0.010309278350515464], ["late", 0.010309278350515464], ["going", 0.010309278350515464], ["bleak", 0.010309278350515464], ["closed", 0.010309278350515464], ["suit", 0.010309278350515464], ["smile", 0.010309278350515464], ["main", 0.010309278350515464], ["company", 0.010309278350515464], ["friendly", 0.010309278350515464], ["nice", 0.010309278350515464], ["head", 0.010309278350515464], ["good", 0.010309278350515464], ["return", 0.010309278350515464], ["norman", 0.010309278350515464], ["porch", 0.010309278350515464], ["nest", 0.010309278350515464], ["men", 0.010309278350515464], ["humbly", 0.010309278350515464], ["deserve", 0.010309278350515464], ["kiss", 0.010309278350515464], ["hurts", 0.010309278350515464], ["convertible", 0.010309278350515464], ["nodded", 0.010309278350515464], ["glad", 0.010309278350515464], ["wait", 0.010309278350515464], ["feeling", 0.010309278350515464], ["cpl", 0.010309278350515464], ["owe", 0.010309278350515464], ["shaped", 0.010309278350515464], ["universe", 0.010309278350515464], ["months", 0.010309278350515464], ["eighteen", 0.010309278350515464], ["reason", 0.010309278350515464], ["governed", 0.010309278350515464], ["leaving", 0.010309278350515464], ["express", 0.010309278350515464], ["nose", 0.010309278350515464], ["suitcase", 0.010309278350515464], ["model", 0.010309278350515464], ["happy", 0.010309278350515464], ["helplessly", 0.010309278350515464], ["waited", 0.010309278350515464], ["shook", 0.010309278350515464]], "sentiment": ["Fuller looked down at the floor. \"Never had a chance with a girl like you\u2014that\u2019s all,\" he said. \"That hurts.\"\nSusanna looked at him wonderingly. \"You don\u2019t know what a chance is,\" she said.\n\"A chance is a late-model convertible, a new suit, and twenty bucks,\" said Fuller.\nSusanna turned her back to him and closed her suitcase \"A chance is a girl,\" she said. \"You smile at her, you be friendly, you be glad she\u2019s a girl.\" She turned and opened her arms again. \"I\u2019m a girl.

But my finger tips had the best of it that night. \u2026\nWhich is not to say that I found myself to be an \u2026 old man, dependent, if I was to please a woman, on \u2026 foreplay and nothing more.

To his back was a vat of syrup that was cooling. The only other person who could see Billy and his spoon was poor old Edgar Derby, who was washing a window outside. The spoon was a tablespoon. Billy thrust it into the vat, turned it around and around, making a gooey lollipop. He thrust it into his mouth.\nA moment went by, and then every cell in Billy\u2019s body shook him with ravenous gratitude and applause.\nThere were diffident raps on the factory window. Derby was out there, having seen all. He wanted some syrup, too.\nSo Billy made a lollipop for him. He opened the window. He stuck the lollipop into poor old Derby\u2019s gaping mouth. A moment passed, and then Derby burst into tears. Billy closed the window and hid the sticky spoon. Somebody was coming.\n8\nTHE AMERICANS in the slaughterhouse had a very interesting visitor two days before Dresden was destroyed. He was Howard W. Campbell, Jr., an American who had become a Nazi. Campbell was the one who had written the monograph about the shabby behavior of American prisoners of war. He wasn\u2019t doing more research about prisoners now. He had come to the slaughterhouse to recruit men for a German military unit called \u201cThe Free American Corps.\u201d Campbell was the inventor and commander of the unit, which was supposed to fight only on the Russian front.\nCampbell was an ordinary-looking man, but he was extravagantly costumed in a uniform of his own design. He wore a white ten-gallon hat and black cowboy boots decorated with swastikas and stars. He was sheathed in a blue body stocking which had yellow stripes running from his armpits to his ankles. His shoulder patch was a silhouette of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s profile on a field of pale green. He had a broad armband which was red, with a blue swastika in a circle of white.\nHe was explaining this armband now in the cement-block hog barn.\nBilly Pilgrim had a boiling case of heartburn, since he had been spooning malt syrup all day long at work. The heartburn brought tears to his eyes, so that his image of Campbell was distorted by jiggling lenses of salt water.\n\u201cBlue is for the American sky,\u201d Campbell was saying. \u201cWhite is for the race that pioneered the continent, drained the swamps and cleared the forests and built the roads and bridges. Red is for the blood of American patriots which was shed so gladly in years gone by.\u201d", 0.014758771929824558], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["titan", 0.035398230088495575], ["german", 0.02654867256637168], ["rumfoord", 0.02654867256637168], ["batball", 0.02654867256637168], ["uwtb", 0.02654867256637168], ["salo", 0.02654867256637168], ["years", 0.017699115044247787], ["waiting", 0.017699115044247787], ["thirty", 0.017699115044247787], ["willy", 0.017699115044247787], ["powered", 0.017699115044247787], ["niles", 0.017699115044247787], ["chrono", 0.017699115044247787], ["nothingness", 0.017699115044247787], ["will", 0.017699115044247787], ["universal", 0.017699115044247787], ["winston", 0.017699115044247787], ["ship", 0.017699115044247787], ["phenomenon", 0.008849557522123894], ["september", 0.008849557522123894], ["major", 0.008849557522123894], ["rest", 0.008849557522123894], ["month", 0.008849557522123894], ["course", 0.008849557522123894], ["earth", 0.008849557522123894], ["galaxy", 0.008849557522123894], ["saturn", 0.008849557522123894], ["workers", 0.008849557522123894], ["doggerel", 0.008849557522123894], ["piddling", 0.008849557522123894], ["recreation", 0.008849557522123894], ["game", 0.008849557522123894], ["earthlings", 0.008849557522123894], ["mnemonically", 0.008849557522123894], ["areas", 0.008849557522123894], ["school", 0.008849557522123894], ["grammar", 0.008849557522123894], ["seldom", 0.008849557522123894], ["gum", 0.008849557522123894], ["newport", 0.008849557522123894], ["popular", 0.008849557522123894], ["replacement", 0.008849557522123894], ["martian", 0.008849557522123894], ["universes", 0.008849557522123894], ["sport", 0.008849557522123894], ["space", 0.008849557522123894], ["ways", 0.008849557522123894], ["factory", 0.008849557522123894], ["moon", 0.008849557522123894], ["messenger", 0.008849557522123894], ["crony", 0.008849557522123894], ["power", 0.008849557522123894], ["pleasant", 0.008849557522123894], ["november", 0.008849557522123894], ["army", 0.008849557522123894], ["cosmic", 0.008849557522123894], ["days", 0.008849557522123894], ["april", 0.008849557522123894], ["milky", 0.008849557522123894], ["mixed", 0.008849557522123894], ["unk", 0.008849557522123894], ["named", 0.008849557522123894], ["somethingness", 0.008849557522123894], ["pays", 0.008849557522123894], ["insist", 0.008849557522123894], ["son", 0.008849557522123894], ["patiently", 0.008849557522123894], ["cared", 0.008849557522123894], ["wonderful", 0.008849557522123894], ["mars", 0.008849557522123894], ["bubble", 0.008849557522123894], ["war", 0.008849557522123894], ["failure", 0.008849557522123894], ["baby", 0.008849557522123894], ["effort", 0.008849557522123894], ["glad", 0.008849557522123894], ["kazak", 0.008849557522123894], ["called", 0.008849557522123894], ["mine", 0.008849557522123894], ["player", 0.008849557522123894], ["forced", 0.008849557522123894], ["creature", 0.008849557522123894], ["poor", 0.008849557522123894], ["plant", 0.008849557522123894], ["knew", 0.008849557522123894], ["june", 0.008849557522123894], ["extremely", 0.008849557522123894], ["infundibulum", 0.008849557522123894]], "sentiment": ["Mnemonically:\nThirty days have Salo, Niles, June, and September, Winston, Chrono, Kazak, and November, April, Rumfoord, Newport, and Infundibulum.

Only he could see where they were going. The others were still on the floor of the bus. Mary Hepburn had dragged the unconscious *James Wait away from the Kanka-bono girls, so that he was lying flat on his back now, with her lap for a pillow. The big brains of the Kanka-bonos had shut down entirely, for want of even a wisp of a theory as to what was going on. Hisako Hiroguchi and Selena MacIntosh and *Kazakh were similarly immobilized.\nAnd everybody was deaf, since the shock wave had done such violence to the bones in their inner ears, the tiniest bones in their bodies. Nor would any of them recover their sense of hearing entirely. With the exception of the Captain, the first colonists on Santa Rosalia would all be slightly deaf, so that a good deal of their conversations would consist, in one language or another, of \u201cEh?\u201d and \u201cSpeak up\u201d and so on.\nThis defect, fortunately, was not inheritable.\nLike Andrew MacIntosh and Zenji Hiroguchi, they would never find out what hit them\u2014unless there were answers to questions like that at the far end of the blue tunnel into the Afterlife. They would accept the Captain\u2019s theory that the explosion and another explosion still to come had been the impacts of white-hot boulders from outer space\u2014but not wholeheartedly, since the Captain would prove to be laughably mistaken about so many things.\nThe Captain\u2019s palsied younger brother, his ears ringing, some of his hearing returning, stopped the bus on the wharf near the Bah\u00eda de Darwin. He had not expected her to be a haven. He was unsurprised to find her dark and apparently deserted, with her windows blown in, her lifeboats missing, and barely secured to the wharf by a single line at her stern. Her freed bow was some distance from the wharf, so that her gangplank dangled over water.\nShe had of course been looted, like the hotel. The wharf was littered with wrappings and cartons and other trash discarded by the scavengers.\n*Siegfried did not expect to see his brother. He had heard that the Captain had left New York, but not that he had actually reached Guayaquil. If the Captain was somewhere in Guayaquil, he was very likely dead or injured, or, in any case, in no position to be of much help to anyone. Nobody in Guayaquil at that point in history was in a position to be of much help to anyone else.\nQuoth Mandarax:\nHelp yourself, and heaven will help you.", 0.024077509791795508], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["life", 0.043478260869565216], ["talker", 0.028985507246376812], ["poor", 0.028985507246376812], ["good", 0.028985507246376812], ["masterpiece", 0.028985507246376812], ["created", 0.028985507246376812], ["prospective", 0.014492753623188406], ["marilee", 0.014492753623188406], ["concept", 0.014492753623188406], ["hell", 0.014492753623188406], ["retroactive", 0.014492753623188406], ["footnote", 0.014492753623188406], ["terry", 0.014492753623188406], ["rest", 0.014492753623188406], ["partner", 0.014492753623188406], ["earth", 0.014492753623188406], ["sexual", 0.014492753623188406], ["rig", 0.014492753623188406], ["help", 0.014492753623188406], ["contentedly", 0.014492753623188406], ["leave", 0.014492753623188406], ["canvas", 0.014492753623188406], ["adrift", 0.014492753623188406], ["paintings", 0.014492753623188406], ["art", 0.014492753623188406], ["create", 0.014492753623188406], ["three", 0.014492753623188406], ["long", 0.014492753623188406], ["painters", 0.014492753623188406], ["feel", 0.014492753623188406], ["ideal", 0.014492753623188406], ["going", 0.014492753623188406], ["lot", 0.014492753623188406], ["vanished", 0.014492753623188406], ["speak", 0.014492753623188406], ["groupie", 0.014492753623188406], ["war", 0.014492753623188406], ["rabo", 0.014492753623188406], ["told", 0.014492753623188406], ["grandchildren", 0.014492753623188406], ["durable", 0.014492753623188406], ["bought", 0.014492753623188406], ["kitchen", 0.014492753623188406], ["hours", 0.014492753623188406], ["spray", 0.014492753623188406], ["private", 0.014492753623188406], ["practically", 0.014492753623188406], ["opprobrium", 0.014492753623188406], ["painter", 0.014492753623188406], ["care", 0.014492753623188406], ["experiencing", 0.014492753623188406], ["wife", 0.014492753623188406], ["will", 0.014492753623188406], ["epiphany", 0.014492753623188406], ["sons", 0.014492753623188406], ["lovemaking", 0.014492753623188406], ["lover", 0.014492753623188406], ["businessman", 0.014492753623188406], ["cosmos", 0.014492753623188406], ["history", 0.014492753623188406], ["outlive", 0.014492753623188406], ["karabekian", 0.014492753623188406]], "sentiment": ["And it was so retroactive!

She said, \u2019Syd, you\u2019re fifty-eight years old now.\u2019\n\u201cYou can imagine how he felt.\n\u201cAnother thing Syd found out was that he was a veteran of something called the Second World War.

should have connection with anyone so glorious. As it happened, he was wearing Argyll socks, and he hitched up his trousers some to look at them. Argyll had a new meaning for him now. One of his ancestors, he told himself, had whipped the Earl of Argyll six times. Fred noticed, too, that he had banged his shins on a table more severely than he'd thought, for there was blood running down to the tops of his Argylls.\nHe read on:\nJohn Graham, rechristened John Rosewater in the Scilly Islands, apparently found the mild climate and the new name congenial, for he remained there for the rest of his life, fathering seven sons and six daughters. He, too, is said to have been a poet, though none of his work survives. If we had some of his poems, they might explain to us what must remain a mystery, why a nobleman would give up his good name and all the privileges it could mean, and be content to live as a simple farmer on an island far from the centers of wealth and power. I can make a guess, and it can never be more than a guess, that he was perhaps sickened by all the bloody things he saw when he fought at his brother's side. At any rate, he made no effort to tell his family where he was, nor to reveal himself as Graham when royalty was restored. In the history of the Grahams, he is said to have been lost at sea while guarding Prince Charles.\nFred heard Caroline throwing up now upstairs.\nJohn Rosewater's third son, Frederick, was the direct ancestor of the Rhode Island Rosewaters. We know little else about him, except that he had a son named George, who was the first Rosewater to leave the islands. George went to London in 1700, became a florist. George had two sons, the younger of which, John, was imprisoned for debt in 1731. He was freed in 1732 by James E. Oglethorpe, who paid his debts on the condition that John accompany Oglethorpe on an expedition to Georgia. John was to serve as chief horticulturalist for the expedition, which planned to plant mulberry trees and raise silk. John Rosewater would also become the chief architect, laying out what was to become the city of Savannah. In 1742, John was badly wounded in the Battle of Bloody Marsh against the Spanish.\nAt this point, Fred was so elated over the resourcefulness and bravery of his own flesh and blood in the past, that he had to tell his wife about it at once. And he didn't think for a moment of bringing the sacred book to his wife. It had to stay in the holy cellar, and she had to come down to it.\nSo he stripped the bedspread away from her, certainly the most audacious, most blatantly sexual act of their marriage, told her his real name was Graham, said an ancestor of his had designed Savannah, told her she had to come down into the cellar with him.\nShe tramped blearily down the stairs after Fred, and he pointed to the manuscript, gave her a strident synopsis of the history of the Rhode Island Rosewaters up to the Battle of Bloody Marsh.\n\"The point I'm trying to make,\" he said, \"is\u2014 we are somebody. I am sick and I am tired of pretending that we just aren't anybody.\"\n\"I never pretended we weren't anybody.\"", -0.01161616161616163], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["nose", 0.020134228187919462], ["people", 0.020134228187919462], ["kathleen", 0.020134228187919462], ["mary", 0.020134228187919462], ["hug", 0.020134228187919462], ["years", 0.013422818791946308], ["crying", 0.013422818791946308], ["lady", 0.013422818791946308], ["bag", 0.013422818791946308], ["cry", 0.013422818791946308], ["bad", 0.013422818791946308], ["shopping", 0.013422818791946308], ["economy", 0.013422818791946308], ["time", 0.013422818791946308], ["man", 0.013422818791946308], ["produced", 0.006711409395973154], ["course", 0.006711409395973154], ["human", 0.006711409395973154], ["corner", 0.006711409395973154], ["avenue", 0.006711409395973154], ["superior", 0.006711409395973154], ["young", 0.006711409395973154], ["better", 0.006711409395973154], ["going", 0.006711409395973154], ["maryland", 0.006711409395973154], ["thousands", 0.006711409395973154], ["woman", 0.006711409395973154], ["rescue", 0.006711409395973154], ["dope", 0.006711409395973154], ["stays", 0.006711409395973154], ["report", 0.006711409395973154], ["stinking", 0.006711409395973154], ["heaven", 0.006711409395973154], ["looney", 0.006711409395973154], ["unrepentant", 0.006711409395973154], ["regiments", 0.006711409395973154], ["slavery", 0.006711409395973154], ["miracle", 0.006711409395973154], ["morning", 0.006711409395973154], ["audience", 0.006711409395973154], ["gripping", 0.006711409395973154], ["ten", 0.006711409395973154], ["conked", 0.006711409395973154], ["dead", 0.006711409395973154], ["accidentally", 0.006711409395973154], ["second", 0.006711409395973154], ["street", 0.006711409395973154], ["concludes", 0.006711409395973154], ["repairs", 0.006711409395973154], ["god", 0.006711409395973154], ["future", 0.006711409395973154], ["smells", 0.006711409395973154], ["tens", 0.006711409395973154], ["receiving", 0.006711409395973154], ["felt", 0.006711409395973154], ["frank", 0.006711409395973154], ["cities", 0.006711409395973154], ["dry", 0.006711409395973154], ["great", 0.006711409395973154], ["country", 0.006711409395973154], ["deferring", 0.006711409395973154], ["chevy", 0.006711409395973154], ["products", 0.006711409395973154], ["cheese", 0.006711409395973154], ["major", 0.006711409395973154], ["civil", 0.006711409395973154], ["wasn", 0.006711409395973154], ["owner", 0.006711409395973154], ["batterers", 0.006711409395973154], ["murderers", 0.006711409395973154], ["eye", 0.006711409395973154], ["crowd", 0.006711409395973154], ["arms", 0.006711409395973154], ["unspecified", 0.006711409395973154], ["tragic", 0.006711409395973154], ["tom", 0.006711409395973154], ["wrapped", 0.006711409395973154], ["brick", 0.006711409395973154], ["perfectly", 0.006711409395973154], ["cabin", 0.006711409395973154], ["walter", 0.006711409395973154], ["engine", 0.006711409395973154], ["sweetheart", 0.006711409395973154], ["wisdom", 0.006711409395973154], ["uncle", 0.006711409395973154], ["child", 0.006711409395973154], ["eat", 0.006711409395973154], ["forty", 0.006711409395973154], ["fiends", 0.006711409395973154], ["15", 0.006711409395973154], ["melodrama", 0.006711409395973154], ["bed", 0.006711409395973154], ["war", 0.006711409395973154], ["will", 0.006711409395973154], ["rags", 0.006711409395973154], ["bungalow", 0.006711409395973154], ["sociologically", 0.006711409395973154], ["investigating", 0.006711409395973154], ["beautiful", 0.006711409395973154], ["prayed", 0.006711409395973154], ["states", 0.006711409395973154], ["hearted", 0.006711409395973154], ["good", 0.006711409395973154], ["claimed", 0.006711409395973154], ["chase", 0.006711409395973154], ["limburger", 0.006711409395973154], ["united", 0.006711409395973154], ["shuts", 0.006711409395973154], ["things", 0.006711409395973154], ["began", 0.006711409395973154], ["machine", 0.006711409395973154], ["merciful", 0.006711409395973154], ["sick", 0.006711409395973154], ["smell", 0.006711409395973154], ["knew", 0.006711409395973154], ["imaginable", 0.006711409395973154], ["bundle", 0.006711409395973154], ["moment", 0.006711409395973154], ["purpose", 0.006711409395973154], ["spitting", 0.006711409395973154], ["awful", 0.006711409395973154], ["america", 0.006711409395973154], ["died", 0.006711409395973154], ["wreckage", 0.006711409395973154], ["noses", 0.006711409395973154], ["wife", 0.006711409395973154], ["ragged", 0.006711409395973154], ["embracing", 0.006711409395973154], ["twigs", 0.006711409395973154]], "sentiment": ["\u201cLook at me in the eye, Walter,\u201d she said.\nSociologically, of course, this melodrama was as gripping as Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin before the Civil War. Mary Kathleen O\u2019Looney wasn\u2019t the only shopping-bag lady in the United States of America. There were tens of thousands of them in major cities throughout the country. Ragged regiments of them had been produced accidentally, and to no imaginable purpose, by the great engine of the economy. Another part of the machine was spitting out unrepentant murderers ten years old, and dope fiends and child batterers and many other bad things. People claimed to be investigating. Unspecified repairs were to be made at some future time.\nGood-hearted people were meanwhile as sick about all these tragic by-products of the economy as they would have been about human slavery a little more than a hundred years before. Mary Kathleen and I were a miracle that our audience must have prayed for again and again: the rescue of at least one shopping-bag lady by a man who knew her well.\nSome people were crying. I myself was about to cry.\n\u201cHug her,\u201d said a woman in the crowd.\nI did so.\nI found myself embracing a bundle of dry twigs that was wrapped in rags. That was when I myself began to cry. I was crying for the first time since I had found my wife dead in bed one morning\u2014in my little brick bungalow in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n15\nMY NOSE, THANK GOD, had conked out by then. Noses are merciful that way. They will report that something smells awful. If the owner of a nose stays around anyway, the nose concludes that the smell isn\u2019t so bad after all. It shuts itself off, deferring to superior wisdom. Thus is it possible to eat Limburger cheese\u2014or to hug the stinking wreckage of an old sweetheart at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street.\nIt felt for a moment as though Mary Kathleen had died in my arms. To be perfectly frank, that would have been all right with me. Where, after all, could I take her from there?
