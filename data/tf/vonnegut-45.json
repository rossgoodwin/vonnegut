I never told you, but I was in the Cornell Club bar for about an hour, eating peanuts by myself, while he talked at the top of his lungs to a guy I took to be his lawyer. Nobody else was there, and he didn\u2019t seem to care what the hell I heard. He sounded crazy to me. He was talking about how he had some youth organizations crying about the spot he was in. He seemed to think the whole thing was pretty damn funny\u2014incredibly funny. That\u2019s it: he couldn\u2019t believe it, it was so funny. Nuts as a fruitcake. Talk about insignias, too.

He gave me what would later turn out to have been a superficial explanation. \u201cIt was something I crowed during the war,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen an artillery barrage I\u2019d called for landed right on target: \u2018Ting-a-ling!

Father swore he had no idea what had become of her. He said, as wife-murderers often do, that maybe she had gone to visit relatives. He killed her that morning, after I left for school.\n\u201cHe got supper for the two of us that night. Father said he would report her as a missing person to the police the next morning, if we hadn\u2019t heard from her by then. He said, \u2018She has been very tired and nervous lately.

which Father and old August Gunther had been lunching when the Mar\u00edtimo brothers arrived in Midland City so long ago. There was a marble bust on a pedestal, which also had to watch. It was another piece of loot from the von Furstenberg estate in Austria. It was a bust of Voltaire.\nAnd Felix used to play God to the chickens, saying in that voice of his, \u201cIf you have any last words to say, now is the time to say them,\u201d or \u201cTake your last look at the world,\u201d and so on. We didn\u2019t raise chickens. A farmer brought in two chickens every Sunday morning, and they had their peepholes closed by a machete in Felix\u2019s right hand almost immediately.\nNow, with Felix watching, and about to catch a train for Columbus and then a bus for Fort Benning, Georgia, it was up to me to do.\nSo I grabbed a chicken by its legs, and I flopped it down on the stump, and I said in a voice like a penny whistle, \u201cTake your last look at the world.\u201d\nOff came its head.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFelix kissed Mother, and he shook Father\u2019s hand, and he boarded the train at the train station. And then Mother and Father and I had to hurry on home, because we were expecting a very important guest for lunch. She was none other than Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of the President of the United States. She was visiting war plants in the boondocks to raise morale.\nWhenever a famous visitor came to Midland City, he or she was usually brought to Father\u2019s studio at one point or another, since there was so little else to see. Usually, they were in Midland City to lecture or sing or play some instrument, or whatever, at the YMCA. That was how I got to meet Nicholas Murray Butler, the president of Columbia University, when I was a boy\u2014and Alexander Woollcott, the wit and writer and broadcaster, and Cornelia Otis Skinner, the monologist, and Gregor Piatigor-sky, the cellist, and on and on.\nThey all said what Mrs. Roosevelt was about to say: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe I\u2019m in Midland City, Ohio.\u201d\nFather used to sprinkle a few drops of turpentine and linseed oil on the hot-air registers, so the place would smell like an active studio. When a guest walked in, there was always some classical record on the phonograph, but never German music after Father decided that being a Nazi wasn\u2019t such a good idea after all. There was always imported wine, even during the war. There was always Liederkranz cheese, and Father would tell the story of its invention.", -0.010788239538239536], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["will", 0.05555555555555555], ["died", 0.027777777777777776], ["worth", 0.018518518518518517], ["forgiven", 0.018518518518518517], ["told", 0.018518518518518517], ["dollars", 0.018518518518518517], ["olly", 0.018518518518518517], ["war", 0.018518518518518517], ["time", 0.018518518518518517], ["man", 0.018518518518518517], ["hearts", 0.018518518518518517], ["surplus", 0.009259259259259259], ["cheerful", 0.009259259259259259], ["ceased", 0.009259259259259259], ["radio", 0.009259259259259259], ["campbell", 0.009259259259259259], ["tempted", 0.009259259259259259], ["saved", 0.009259259259259259], ["principal", 0.009259259259259259], ["personal", 0.009259259259259259], ["father", 0.009259259259259259], ["1945", 0.009259259259259259], ["touched", 0.009259259259259259], ["pretty", 0.009259259259259259], ["real", 0.009259259259259259], ["easily", 0.009259259259259259], ["nation", 0.009259259259259259], ["break", 0.009259259259259259], ["inflation", 0.009259259259259259], ["fortune", 0.009259259259259259], ["day", 0.009259259259259259], ["disinherit", 0.009259259259259259], ["enemy", 0.009259259259259259], ["magic", 0.009259259259259259], ["warned", 0.009259259259259259], ["treason", 0.009259259259259259], ["notorious", 0.009259259259259259], ["fairy", 0.009259259259259259], ["spring", 0.009259259259259259], ["rate", 0.009259259259259259], ["growth", 0.009259259259259259], ["year", 0.009259259259259259], ["blue", 0.009259259259259259], ["forty", 0.009259259259259259], ["legal", 0.009259259259259259], ["boodle", 0.009259259259259259], ["won", 0.009259259259259259], ["free", 0.009259259259259259], ["broken", 0.009259259259259259], ["job", 0.009259259259259259], ["jr", 0.009259259259259259], ["hiding", 0.009259259259259259], ["boy", 0.009259259259259259], ["times", 0.009259259259259259], ["ox", 0.009259259259259259], ["commit", 0.009259259259259259], ["turncoat", 0.009259259259259259], ["godmother", 0.009259259259259259], ["anti", 0.009259259259259259], ["wasn", 0.009259259259259259], ["cleared", 0.009259259259259259], ["howard", 0.009259259259259259], ["bequeathed", 0.009259259259259259], ["long", 0.009259259259259259], ["live", 0.009259259259259259], ["call", 0.009259259259259259], ["bitterly", 0.009259259259259259], ["recruited", 0.009259259259259259], ["today", 0.009259259259259259], ["serve", 0.009259259259259259], ["probate", 0.009259259259259259], ["11", 0.009259259259259259], ["stocks", 0.009259259259259259], ["cash", 0.009259259259259259], ["property", 0.009259259259259259], ["beamish", 0.009259259259259259], ["unearned", 0.009259259259259259], ["estate", 0.009259259259259259], ["high", 0.009259259259259259], ["middle", 0.009259259259259259], ["semite", 0.009259259259259259], ["sixties", 0.009259259259259259], ["income", 0.009259259259259259], ["star", 0.009259259259259259], ["tiergarten", 0.009259259259259259], ["device", 0.009259259259259259], ["america", 0.009259259259259259], ["ago", 0.009259259259259259], ["stateless", 0.009259259259259259], ["neck", 0.009259259259259259], ["person", 0.009259259259259259], ["mother", 0.009259259259259259]], "sentiment": ["And when that nation ceased to be, I became what I am today and what I always will be, a stateless person.\nI can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t warned.

The picture that went with it was the picture of the three sirens of Titan. There they were\u2014the white girl, the golden girl, and the brown girl.\nThe fingers of the golden girl were fortuitously spread as they rested on her left breast, permitting an artist to paint in a MoonMist Cigarette between two of them. The smoke from her cigarette passed beneath the nostrils of the brown and white girls, and their space-annihilating concupiscence seemed centered on mentholated smoke alone.\nRumfoord had known that Constant would try to debase the picture by using it in commerce. Constant\u2019s father had done a similar thing when he found he could not buy Leonardo\u2019s \"Mona Lisa\" at any price. The old man had punished Mona Lisa by having her used in an advertising campaign for suppositories. It was the free-enterprise way of handling beauty that threatened to get the upper hand.\nRumfoord made a buzzing sound on his lips, which was a sound he made when he approached compassion. The compassion he approached was for Malachi Constant, who was having a far worse time of it than Beatrice.\n\"Have I heard your whole defense?\" said Beatrice, coming behind Rumfoord\u2019s chair. Her arms were folded, and Rumfoord, reading her mind, knew that she thought of her sharp, projected elbows as bull-fighter\u2019s swords.\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Rumfoord.\n\"This silence\u2014this hiding in the magazine\u2014this is the sum and total of your rebuttal?\" said Beatrice.\n\"Rebuttal\u2014a punctual word if there ever was one,\" said Rumfoord. \"I say this, and then you rebut me, then I rebut you, then somebody else comes in and rebuts us both.\" He shuddered. \"What a nightmare where everybody gets in line to rebut each other.\"\n\"Couldn\u2019t you, this very moment,\" said Beatrice, \"give me stock-market tips that would enable me to gain back everything I lost and more? If you had one shred of concern for me, couldn\u2019t you tell me exactly how Malachi Constant of Hollywood is going to try to trick me into going to Mars, so I could outwit him?\"\n\"Look,\" said Rumfoord, \"life for a punctual person is like a roller coaster.\" He turned to shiver his hands in her face. \"All kinds of things are going to happen to you! Sure,\" he said, \"I can see the whole roller coaster you\u2019re on. And sure\u2014I could give you a piece of paper that would tell you about every dip and turn, warn you about every bogeyman that was going to pop out at you in the tunnels.

juvenile delinquent, and it becomes a permanent part of your vocabulary. Dr. Z was a Mespoulets, and died without having risen above that rank. Sol Tax may have been a Mespoulets at one time, but he certainly wasn\u2019t one when I got here. I find it hard to believe that the head of the department, Dr. Robert Redfield, who made his reputation, and the department\u2019s reputation, too, with an extended essay called \u201cThe Folk Society,\u201d had ever been a Mespoulets. There: That\u2019s three times, I think.\nDr. Tax, recalling the department\u2019s dead and gone Mespoulets of long ago, said that Dr. Z had written well about the controversial Native American religion, the Peyote Cult.\nSo far as Dr. Tax was aware, Dr. Z hadn\u2019t done much writing since then. Only those of us who took Z\u2019s freestyle summer course were aware of the scale of the ambitions of our mentor. Each seminar, we came to realize, was an airing and testing of ideas in a chapter of a book about the human condition he was writing or planned to write. I didn\u2019t share that information with Dr. Tax, but I did ask him if he had the address of my dead mentor\u2019s longtime widow. He did.\nShe had long since remarried. I wrote to her, wanting to tell her how stimulating I had found her first husband, and how useful his wide-ranging speculations had been to me in my career in fiction. I must have reminded her of utterly ghastly unhappiness which she had hoped to put behind her. We had never met, and never will meet, for there was no reply.\nIf there had been one, I would have asked her if he got any of his big ideas on paper, and where, if anywhere, some pages were. Ah me.\nLong term, I am as indebted to the head of the department in my day, Dr. Robert Redfield, as I am to its Mespoulets. Dostoyevsky suggested that one sacred memory from childhood was perhaps the best education. I say to you that one plausible, romantic theory about humanity is perhaps the best prize you can take away from a university. And Dr. Redfield\u2019s theory of the Folk Society was that for me. It has been the starting point for my politics, such as they are.\nMy politics in a nutshell: Let\u2019s stop giving corporations and newfangled contraptions what they need, and get back to giving human beings what we need.\nLong before I got here, all theories of cultural evolution had been proposed and discarded, for want of evidence to support them. Cultures were not describable, predictable rungs on a ladder societies were bound to climb, from polytheism to monotheism, for example, and so on.\nBut Dr. Redfield said, in effect, and I condense and paraphrase or worse: \u201cWait a minute. I think I can describe in some detail one stage many, many societies have reached or left behind, neither higher or lower than any other.\u201d It might be worth thinking about because it was or had been so common. Dr. Redfield\u2019s course in the Folk Society, which he gave every year, was enormously popular, drawing auditors from all over the university. Is his theory much discussed here or anywhere nowadays?\nA Folk Society, he said, was a relatively small number of persons bonded by kinship and a common history of some duration, with a territory uncontested or easily defended, and sufficiently isolated so as to be little influenced by the cultures of other societies.", 0.06259632034632036], "title": "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"},

*Andrew MacIntosh, had found ensuring the survival of the human race a total bore.\nIt was a lot more fun, so to speak, to hit and hit a tennis ball.\nThe seeing-eye dog Kazakh sat by the baggage rack at the foot of Selena\u2019s king-size bed. Kazakh was a female German shepherd. She was at ease, and free to be herself, since she was not at the moment wearing her harness and handle. And her small brain, cued by the smell of meat, made her look up at Ortiz with her big brown eyes most hopefully, and to wag her tail.\nDogs back then were far superior to people when it came to distinguishing between different odors. Thanks to Darwin\u2019s Law of Natural Selection, all human beings now have senses of smell as acute as Kazakh\u2019s. And they have surpassed dogs in one respect: They can smell things underwater.\nDogs still can\u2019t even swim underwater, although they have had a million years in which to learn. They goof around as much as ever. They can\u2019t even catch fish yet. And I would have to say that the whole rest of the animal world has done strikingly little to improve its survival tactics in all that time, except for humankind.\n16\nWHAT *ANDREW MACINTOSH now said to Jes\u00fas Ortiz was so offensive, and, in view of the hunger pangs spreading throughout Ecuador, so dangerous, that his big brain really must have been sick in some serious way\u2014if giving a damn what happened next was a sign of mental health. The outrageous insult he was about to offer to this friendly and good-hearted waiter, moreover, was not deliberate.\nThis was a boxy man of medium stature, his head a box set atop a larger one, and with very thick arms and legs. He was as lusty and able an outdoorsman as Mary Hepburn\u2019s husband Roy had been, but eager to take terrifying chances, too, which Roy had never been. *MacIntosh had teeth so big and white perfect, and he gave Ortiz such a good look, Ortiz was reminded of keys on a grand piano.\n*MacIntosh said to him in Spanish, \u201cUncover the steaks and put them both on the floor for the dog, and then get out of here.\u201d\nSpeaking of teeth: There have never been dentists on Santa Rosalia or any of the other human colonies in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. As would have been the case a million years ago, a typical colonist can expect to be edentate by the time he or she is thirty years old, having suffered many skull-cracking toothaches on the way. And this is more than a blow to mere vanity, surely, since teeth set in living gums are now people\u2019s only tools.", 0.08128706199460918], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["death", 0.01652892561983471], ["born", 0.01652892561983471], ["york", 0.01652892561983471], ["american", 0.01652892561983471], ["city", 0.01652892561983471], ["war", 0.01652892561983471], ["soul", 0.01652892561983471], ["limited", 0.008264462809917356], ["infant", 0.008264462809917356], ["course", 0.008264462809917356], ["drawings", 0.008264462809917356], ["hell", 0.008264462809917356], ["continent", 0.008264462809917356], ["principal", 0.008264462809917356], ["supposedly", 0.008264462809917356], ["lining", 0.008264462809917356], ["forms", 0.008264462809917356], ["parents", 0.008264462809917356], ["board", 0.008264462809917356], ["easy", 0.008264462809917356], ["columns", 0.008264462809917356], ["wearing", 0.008264462809917356], ["sick", 0.008264462809917356], ["television", 0.008264462809917356], ["blank", 0.008264462809917356], ["birth", 0.008264462809917356], ["armenian", 0.008264462809917356], ["leave", 0.008264462809917356], ["bankrolled", 0.008264462809917356], ["small", 0.008264462809917356], ["americans", 0.008264462809917356], ["battlefield", 0.008264462809917356], ["art", 0.008264462809917356], ["ten", 0.008264462809917356], ["hard", 0.008264462809917356], ["portfolio", 0.008264462809917356], ["navy", 0.008264462809917356], ["diving", 0.008264462809917356], ["womblike", 0.008264462809917356], ["merchants", 0.008264462809917356], ["chicago", 0.008264462809917356], ["pullman", 0.008264462809917356], ["pipes", 0.008264462809917356], ["armaments", 0.008264462809917356], ["womb", 0.008264462809917356], ["solvent", 0.008264462809917356], ["merchandising", 0.008264462809917356], ["cars", 0.008264462809917356], ["twentieth", 0.008264462809917356], ["imagine", 0.008264462809917356], ["cardboard", 0.008264462809917356], ["boy", 0.008264462809917356], ["speeches", 0.008264462809917356], ["generals", 0.008264462809917356], ["central", 0.008264462809917356], ["boast", 0.008264462809917356], ["industry", 0.008264462809917356], ["remains", 0.008264462809917356], ["patriotic", 0.008264462809917356], ["admirals", 0.008264462809917356], ["embryo", 0.008264462809917356], ["washington", 0.008264462809917356], ["number", 0.008264462809917356], ["owned", 0.008264462809917356], ["philosophical", 0.008264462809917356], ["simply", 0.008264462809917356], ["wasn", 0.008264462809917356], ["message", 0.008264462809917356], ["nowadays", 0.008264462809917356], ["canal", 0.008264462809917356], ["army", 0.008264462809917356], ["sake", 0.008264462809917356], ["influence", 0.008264462809917356], ["political", 0.008264462809917356], ["start", 0.008264462809917356], ["station", 0.008264462809917356], ["call", 0.008264462809917356], ["suit", 0.008264462809917356], ["valise", 0.008264462809917356], ["grandchildren", 0.008264462809917356], ["manufacturers", 0.008264462809917356], ["shoals", 0.008264462809917356], ["great", 0.008264462809917356], ["carrying", 0.008264462809917356], ["shoot", 0.008264462809917356], ["high", 0.008264462809917356], ["kind", 0.008264462809917356], ["tunnel", 0.008264462809917356], ["plunged", 0.008264462809917356], ["movies", 0.008264462809917356], ["crossed", 0.008264462809917356], ["anew", 0.008264462809917356], ["newspaper", 0.008264462809917356], ["piece", 0.008264462809917356], ["minutes", 0.008264462809917356], ["beguiling", 0.008264462809917356], ["san", 0.008264462809917356], ["century", 0.008264462809917356], ["mind", 0.008264462809917356], ["states", 0.008264462809917356], ["preferably", 0.008264462809917356], ["ignacio", 0.008264462809917356], ["united", 0.008264462809917356], ["relatives", 0.008264462809917356], ["best", 0.008264462809917356], ["sacred", 0.008264462809917356], ["grand", 0.008264462809917356], ["ordinary", 0.008264462809917356], ["economy", 0.008264462809917356], ["wires", 0.008264462809917356], ["friends", 0.008264462809917356], ["man", 0.008264462809917356], ["land", 0.008264462809917356], ["talk", 0.008264462809917356]], "sentiment": ["That was an ordinary way for a patriotic American to talk back then.

letter of April 25, received by me only this morning.\nAn enthusiasm for technological cures for almost all forms of human discontent was the only religion of my family during the Great Depression, when I first got to know that family well. It was religion enough for me, and one branch of the family owned the largest hardware store in Indianapolis, Indiana. I still do not believe that I was wrong to adore the cunning devices and compounds on sale there, and when I feel most lost in this world, I comfort myself by visiting a hardware store. I meditate there. I do not buy anything. A hammer is still my Jesus, and my Virgin Mary is still a cross-cut saw.\nBut I learned how vile that religion of mine could be when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. The date of that event can be found in almost any good reference book. How profound had my innocence been? Only six months before, as a captured American foot soldier, I had been in Dresden when it was burned to the ground by a purposely set firestorm. I was still innocent after that. Why? Because the technology which created that firestorm was so familiar to me. I understood it entirely, and so had no trouble imagining how the same amount of ingenuity and determination could benefit mankind once the war was over. I could even help. There was nothing in the bombs or the airplanes, after all, which could not, essentially, be bought at a small hardware store.\nAs for fire: Everybody knows what you do with unwanted fire. You put water on it.\nBut the bombing of Hiroshima compelled me to see that a trust in technology, like all the other great religions of the world, had to do with the human soul. I will bet you the one thousand crowns you have offered me for this piece that every one of the tales of lost innocence you receive will embody not only the startling discovery of the human soul, but of how diseased it can be.\nHow sick was the soul revealed by the flash at Hiroshima? And I deny that it was a specifically American soul. It was the soul of every highly industrialized nation on earth, whether at war or at peace. How sick was it? It was so sick that it did not want to live anymore. What other sort of soul would create a new physics based on nightmares, would place into the hands of mere politicians a planet so \u201cdestabilized,\u201d to borrow a CIA term, that the briefest fit of stupidity could easily guarantee the end of the world?\nIt is supposed to be good to lose one\u2019s innocence. I do not read them, but I think that is what my novels say, so it must be true. I, for one, now know what is really going on, so I can plan more shrewdly and be less open to surprise. But my morale has been lowered a good deal, so I am probably not any stronger than I used to be. Since Hiroshima, I have increased my amperes but decreased my volts, and wound up with the same number of watts, so to speak.\nIt is quite awful, really, to realize that perhaps most of the people around me find lives in the service of machines so tedious and exasperating that they would not mind much, even if they have children, if life were turned off like a light switch at any time. How many of your readers will deny that the movie Dr. Strangelove was so popular because its ending was such a happy one?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI am invited to all sorts of neo-Luddite gatherings, of course, and am sometimes asked to speak.

After all, Charley had no other children, he loved Robert, and he thought that raising the boy was the best thing he and his wife had done with their lives. So Charley planned to make a sentimental little ceremony of surrendering Robert\u2019s person before the boy went into the bank.\nCharley didn\u2019t know about Robert\u2019s marriage, so Charley\u2019s plan was for just two people.\nCharley went into the Atlantic House a half an hour before Robert was supposed to arrive. Charley went into the bar side of the restaurant, and he picked a small table for two.\nHe sat down and waited.\nSeveral people in the bar knew Charley, and they nodded to him. Those who knew Charley well were surprised to see him on the bar side, because Charley hadn\u2019t dared to take a drink for eight years. He hadn\u2019t dared to drink because he was an alcoholic. One small beer was enough to start Charley on a toot that could last for weeks.\nA new waitress who didn\u2019t know Charley took his order, went over to the bar, announced the order loud and clear. \u201cBourbon on the rocks,\u201d she said. She said it emptily. She didn\u2019t know that she was announcing big news, announcing that Charley Brewer, after eight dry-as-dust years, was going to have a drink.\nCharley got his drink.\nNed Crosby, the owner of the Atlantic House, came right along with it.

Eliot's ailment, waited tensely for someone to urge the Senator to continue. No one did, so Mushari exposed himself. \"And what did the doctor say?\"\nThe Senator, suspecting nothing, resumed his tale: \"These people never want to talk about what you want to talk about. It's always something else. When he found out who I was, he didn't want to talk about Eliot. He wanted to talk about the Rosewater Law.\" The Rosewater Law was what the Senator thought of as his legislative masterpiece. It made the publication or possession of obscene materials a Federal offense, carrying penalties up to fifty thousand dollars and ten years in prison, without hope of parole. It was a masterpiece because it actually defined obscenity.\nObscenity, it said, is any picture or phonograph record or any written matter calling attention to reproductive organs, bodily discharges, or bodily hair.\n\"This psychoanalyst,\" the Senator complained, \"wanted to know about my childhood. He wanted to go into my feelings about bodily hair.\" The Senator shuddered. \"I asked him to kindly get off the subject, that my revulsions were shared, so far as I knew, by all decent men.\" He pointed to McAllister, simply wanting to point at someone, anyone. \"There's your key to pornography. Other people say, 'Oh, how can you recognize it, how can you tell it from art and all that?' I've written the key into law! The difference between pornography and art is bodily hair!\"\nHe flushed, apologized abjectly to Sylvia. \"I beg your pardon, my dear.\"\nMushari had to prod him again. \"And the doctor didn't say anything about Eliot?\"\n\"The damn doctor said Eliot never told him a damn thing but well-known facts from history, almost all of them related to the oppression of odd-balls or the poor. He said any diagnosis he made of Eliot's disease would have to be irresponsible speculation. As a deeply worried father, I told the doctor, 'Go ahead and guess as much as you want to about my son. I won't hold you responsible. I'd be most grateful if you'd say anything, true or not, because I ran out of ideas about my boy, responsible or irresponsible, true or not, years ago. Stick your stainless steel spoon in this unhappy old man's brains, Doctor,' I told him, 'and stir.'\n\"He said to me, 'Before I tell you what my irresponsible thoughts are, I'll have to discuss sexual perversion some. I intend to involve Eliot in the discussion\u2014so, if an involvement of that sort would affect you violently, let's have our talk come to an end right here.' 'Carry on,' I said. 'I'm an old futz, and the theory is that an old futz can't be hurt very much by anything anybody says. I've never believed it before, but I'll try to believe it now.'\n\" 'Very well\u2014' he said, 'let's assume that a healthy young man is supposed to be sexually aroused by an attractive woman not his mother or sister. If he's aroused by other things, another man, say, or an umbrella or the ostrich boa of the Empress Josephine or a sheep or a corpse or his mother or a stolen garterbelt, he is what we call a pervert.'\n\"I replied that I had always known such people were about, but that I'd never thought much about them because there didn't seem to be much to think about them.", 0.08096320346320349],

The last words Walter had ever said to me were at his mother\u2019s burial in a small Jewish cemetery in Chevy Chase. That she should be buried in such a place and in such company was entirely my idea\u2014the idea of an old man suddenly all alone. Ruth would have said, correctly, that it was a crazy thing to do.\nShe was buried in a plain pine box that cost one hundred and fifty-six dollars. Atop that box I placed a bough, broken not cut, from our flowering crab apple tree.\nA rabbi prayed over her in Hebrew, a language she had never heard, although she must have had endless opportunities to learn it in the concentration camp.\nOur son said this to me, before showing his back to me and the open pit and hastening to a waiting taxicab: \u201cI pity you, but I can never love you. As far as I am concerned, you killed this poor woman. I can\u2019t think of you anymore as a father or as any sort of relative. I never want to see or hear of you again.\u201d\nStrong stuff.\nMy prison daydream of New York City did suppose, however, that there were still old acquaintances, although I could not name them, who might help me to get a job. It is a hard daydream to let go of\u2014that one has friends. Those who would have remained my friends, if life had gone a little bit better for me, would have been mainly in New York. I imagined that, if I were to prowl midtown Manhattan day after day, from the theater district on the west to the United Nations on the east, and from the Public Library on the south to the Plaza Hotel on the north, and past all the foundations and publishing houses and bookstores and clothiers for gentlemen and clubs for gentlemen and expensive hotels and restaurants in between, I would surely meet somebody who knew me, who remembered what a good man I used to be, who did not especially despise me\u2014who would use his influence to get me a job tending bar somewhere.\nI would plead with him shamelessly, and rub his nose in my Doctor of Mixology degree.\nIf I saw my son coming, so went the daydream, I would show him my back until he was safely by.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Larkin, \u201cJesus tells me not to give up on anybody, but I\u2019m close to giving up on you.

down from Heaven now, or wherever it is that war heroes go after dying, he would be dismayed to see his beloved campus surrounded by barbed wire and watchtowers. The bells are shot to hell. The number of students, if you can call convicts that, is about 2,000 now.\nWHEN THERE WERE only 300 \u201cstudents\u201d here, each one had a bedroom and a bathroom and plenty of closets all his or her own. Each bedroom was part of a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom suite with a common living room for 2. Each living room had couches and easy chairs and a working fireplace, and state-of-the-art sound-reproduction equipment and a big-screen TV.\nAt the Athena state prison, as I would discover when I went to work over there, there were 6 men to each cell and each cell had been built for 2. Each 50 cells had a recreation room with one Ping-Pong table and one TV. The TV, moreover, showed only tapes of programs, including news, at least 10 years old. The idea was to keep the prisoners from becoming distressed about anything going on in the outside world that hadn\u2019t been all taken care of one way or the other, presumably, in the long-ago.\nThey could feast their eyes on whatever they liked, just so long as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\nHOW THOSE LETTER-WRITERS loved not just the college but the whole Mohiga Valley\u2014the seasons, the lake, the forest primeval on the other side. And there were few differences between student pleasures in their times and my own. In my time, students didn\u2019t skate on the lake anymore, but on an indoor rink given in 1971 by the Israel Cohen Family. But they still had sailboat races and canoe races on the lake. They still had picnics by the ruins of the locks at the head of the lake. Many students still brought their own horses to school with them. In my time, several students brought not just 1 horse but 3, since polo was a major sport. In 1976 and again in 1980, Tarkington College had an undefeated polo team.\nThere are no horses in the stable now, of course. The escaped convicts, surrounded and starving a mere 4 days after the prison break, calling themselves \u201cFreedom Fighters\u201d and flying an American flag from the top of the bell tower of this library, ate the horses and the campus dogs, too, and fed pieces of them to their hostages, who were the Trustees of the college.\nTHE MOST SUCCESSFUL athlete ever to come from Tarkington, arguably, was a horseman from my own time, Lowell Chung. He won a Bronze Medal as a member of the United States Equestrian Team in Seoul, South Korea, back in 1988. His mother owned half of Honolulu, but he couldn\u2019t read or write or do math worth a darn. He could sure do Physics, though. He could tell me how levers and lenses and electricity and heat and all sorts of power plants worked, and predict correctly what an experiment would prove before I\u2019d performed it\u2014just as long as I didn\u2019t insist that he quantify anything, that he tell me what the numbers were.\nHe earned his Associate in the Arts and Sciences Degree in 1984. That was the only degree we awarded, fair warning to other institutions and future employers, and to the students themselves, that our graduates\u2019 intellectual achievements, while respectable, were unconventional.\nLOWELL CHUNG GOT me on a horse for the first time in my life when I was 43 years old. He dared me. I told him I certainly wasn\u2019t going to commit suicide on the back of one of his fire-cracker polo ponies, since I had a wife and a mother-in-law and 2 children to support.
