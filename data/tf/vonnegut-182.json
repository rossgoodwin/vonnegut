O\u2019Looney, before he finally found out who Mary Kathleen really was, fell in love with his dream of her when she was young. He had it all wrong, incidentally. He dreamed that she was tall and buxom and black-haired, whereas she had been short and scrawny and red-haired. He dreamed that she was an immigrant who had gone to work for an eccentric millionaire in a spooky mansion, and that she had been both attracted and repelled by this man, and that he had abused her to the point of death.\nAll this came out in divorce proceedings brought against O\u2019Looney by his wife of thirty-two years. It was front-page stuff in the tabloids for a week or more. O\u2019Looney was already famous by then. The papers called him \u201cThe man who blew the whistle on RAMJAC,\u201d or variations on that theme. Now his wife was claiming that his affections had been alienated by a ghost. He wouldn\u2019t sleep with her anymore. He stopped brushing his teeth. He was chronically late to work. He became a grandfather, and he didn\u2019t care. He wouldn\u2019t even look at the baby.\nWhat was particularly sick about his behavior was that, even after he found out what Mary Kathleen had really been like, he stayed in love with the original dream.\n\u201cNobody can ever take that away from me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most precious thing I own.\u201d\nHe has been relieved of his duties, I hear. His wife is suing him again\u2014this time for her share in the small fortune he got for the movie rights to his dream. The film is to be shot in a spooky old mansion in Morristown. If you can believe the gossip columns, there is to be a talent search for an actress to play the Irish immigrant girl. Al Pacino has already agreed to play Sheriff O\u2019Looney, and Kevin McCarthy to play the eccentric millionaire.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo I dallied too long, and now I must go to prison again, they say. My high jinks with Mary Kathleen\u2019s remains were not crimes in and of themselves, since corpses have no more rights than do orts from last night\u2019s midnight snack. My actions were accessory, however, to the commission of a class E felony, which according to Section 190.30 of the Penal Law of New York State consists of unlawfully concealing a will.\nI had entombed the will itself in a safe-deposit box of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, a division of RAMJAC.\nI have tried to explain to my little dog that her master must go away for a while\u2014because he violated Section 190.30. I have told her that laws are written to be obeyed. She understands nothing. She loves my voice. All news from me is good news. She wags her tail.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.11141349721706868], "title": "Jailbird"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["redwine", 0.03821656050955414], ["fire", 0.03821656050955414], ["bell", 0.03184713375796178], ["rain", 0.03184713375796178], ["screams", 0.025477707006369428], ["malachi", 0.025477707006369428], ["meant", 0.01910828025477707], ["doll", 0.01910828025477707], ["spoke", 0.01910828025477707], ["rope", 0.01910828025477707], ["knot", 0.012738853503184714], ["dripped", 0.012738853503184714], ["steeple", 0.012738853503184714], ["hung", 0.012738853503184714], ["house", 0.012738853503184714], ["proper", 0.012738853503184714], ["space", 0.012738853503184714], ["imagined", 0.012738853503184714], ["spring", 0.012738853503184714], ["water", 0.012738853503184714], ["feet", 0.012738853503184714], ["church", 0.012738853503184714], ["wanderer", 0.012738853503184714], ["arrived", 0.012738853503184714], ["alarm", 0.012738853503184714], ["flagstone", 0.006369426751592357], ["woods", 0.006369426751592357], ["hanging", 0.006369426751592357], ["cold", 0.006369426751592357], ["religious", 0.006369426751592357], ["window", 0.006369426751592357], ["going", 0.006369426751592357], ["wet", 0.006369426751592357], ["rafter", 0.006369426751592357], ["good", 0.006369426751592357], ["rescue", 0.006369426751592357], ["bowers", 0.006369426751592357], ["frail", 0.006369426751592357], ["harmoniously", 0.006369426751592357], ["beads", 0.006369426751592357], ["barnstable", 0.006369426751592357], ["level", 0.006369426751592357], ["wooden", 0.006369426751592357], ["fairy", 0.006369426751592357], ["revere", 0.006369426751592357], ["heavy", 0.006369426751592357], ["ten", 0.006369426751592357], ["puddle", 0.006369426751592357], ["daffodils", 0.006369426751592357], ["paul", 0.006369426751592357], ["dominated", 0.006369426751592357], ["crocuses", 0.006369426751592357], ["bedlam", 0.006369426751592357], ["business", 0.006369426751592357], ["joy", 0.006369426751592357], ["loose", 0.006369426751592357], ["tied", 0.006369426751592357], ["members", 0.006369426751592357], ["represented", 0.006369426751592357], ["faith", 0.006369426751592357], ["arrive", 0.006369426751592357], ["seeped", 0.006369426751592357], ["shingle", 0.006369426751592357], ["ill", 0.006369426751592357], ["chilly", 0.006369426751592357], ["place", 0.006369426751592357], ["chaucerian", 0.006369426751592357], ["glorious", 0.006369426751592357], ["glittering", 0.006369426751592357], ["grapes", 0.006369426751592357], ["lilac", 0.006369426751592357], ["west", 0.006369426751592357], ["top", 0.006369426751592357], ["concord", 0.006369426751592357], ["three", 0.006369426751592357], ["remotely", 0.006369426751592357], ["vehicle", 0.006369426751592357], ["speaking", 0.006369426751592357], ["engine", 0.006369426751592357], ["head", 0.006369426751592357], ["crack", 0.006369426751592357], ["springtime", 0.006369426751592357], ["goblin", 0.006369426751592357], ["volunteer", 0.006369426751592357], ["roof", 0.006369426751592357], ["grass", 0.006369426751592357], ["called", 0.006369426751592357], ["life", 0.006369426751592357], ["dropped", 0.006369426751592357], ["trickled", 0.006369426751592357], ["listened", 0.006369426751592357], ["floor", 0.006369426751592357], ["soaked", 0.006369426751592357], ["member", 0.006369426751592357], ["fitting", 0.006369426751592357], ["significance", 0.006369426751592357], ["department", 0.006369426751592357], ["repellent", 0.006369426751592357], ["blooms", 0.006369426751592357], ["hang", 0.006369426751592357], ["hangman", 0.006369426751592357], ["mankind", 0.006369426751592357], ["noise", 0.006369426751592357], ["fatly", 0.006369426751592357], ["neck", 0.006369426751592357], ["scream", 0.006369426751592357], ["crept", 0.006369426751592357], ["english", 0.006369426751592357], ["aloud", 0.006369426751592357], ["sash", 0.006369426751592357]], "sentiment": ["The West Barnstable Volunteer Fire Department was so dominated by members of Redwine\u2019s church that the fire engine itself was going to arrive as the only vehicle remotely glorious enough for the Space Wanderer.\nThe screams of the fire alarm on top of the fire-house were to be added to the bedlam joy of the bell. One scream from the alarm meant a grass or woods fire. Two screams meant a house fire. Three screams meant a rescue. Ten screams would mean that the Space Wanderer had arrived.\nWater seeped in around an ill-fitting window sash. Water crept under a loose shingle in the roof, dropped through a crack and hung in glittering beads from a rafter over Redwine\u2019s head. The good rain wet the old Paul Revere bell in the steeple, trickled down the bell rope, soaked the wooden doll tied to the end of the bell rope, dripped from the feet of the doll, made a puddle on the steeple\u2019s flagstone floor.\nThe doll had a religious significance. It represented a repellent way of life that was no more. It was called a Malachi.

This wasn\u2019t compassion on his part. He was being machinery again. Trout was, like so many Earthlings, a fully automatic boob when a pathological personality like Elgin Washington told him what to want, what to do. Both men, incidentally, were descendants of the Emperor Charlemagne. Anybody with any European blood in him was a descendant of the Emperor Charlemagne.\nElgin Washington perceived that he had caught yet another human being without really meaning to. It was not in his nature to let one go without making him feel in some way diminished, in some way a fool. Sometimes he actually killed a man in order to diminish him, but he was gentle with Trout. He closed his eyes as though thinking hard, then he earnestly said, \u201cI think I may be dying.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a nurse!\u201d said Trout. Any human being would have said exactly the same thing.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Elgin Washington, waving his hands in dreamy protest. \u201cI\u2019m dying slow. It\u2019s gradual.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Trout.\n\u201cYou got to do me a favor,\u201d said Washington. He had no idea what favor to ask. It would come to him. Ideas for favors always came.\n\u201cWhat favor?\u201d said Trout uneasily. He stiffened at the mention of an unspecified favor. He was that kind of a machine. Washington knew he would stiffen. Every human being was that kind of a machine.\n\u201cI want you to listen to me while I whistle the song of the Nightingale,\u201d he said. He commanded Trout to be silent by giving him the evil eye. \u201cWhat adds peculiar beauty to the call of the Nightingale, much beloved by poets,\u201d he said, \u201cis the fact that it will only sing by moonlight.\u201d Then he did what almost every black person in Midland City would do: He imitated a Nightingale.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe Midland City Festival of the Arts was postponed because of madness.

If you had fought in Poland, you would know he was a very common type.\"\n\"Look\u2014look who\u2019s coming now,\" said the carpenter, grinning. \"Full of arguments as you are, you won\u2019t argue with me about him. There we have an American!\" He called out to the child. \"Joe\u2014when you going to win the championship back?\"\n\"Joe!\" called the mechanic. \"How is the Brown Bomber today?\"\nAt the very end of the parade, a lone, blue-eyed colored boy, six years old, turned and smiled with sweet uneasiness at those who called out to him every day. He nodded politely, murmuring a greeting in German, the only language he knew.\nHis name, chosen arbitrarily by the nuns, was Karl Heinz. But the carpenter had given him a name that stuck, the name of the only colored man who had ever made an impression on the villagers\u2019 minds, the former heavyweight champion of the world, Joe Louis.\n\"Joe!\" called the carpenter. \"Cheer up! Let\u2019s see those white teeth sparkle, Joe.\"\nJoe obliged shyly.\nThe carpenter clapped the mechanic on the back. \"And if he isn\u2019t a German too! Maybe it\u2019s the only way we can get another heavyweight champion.\"", 0.049347826086956516], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["women", 0.07407407407407407], ["people", 0.037037037037037035], ["captured", 0.037037037037037035], ["half", 0.037037037037037035], ["healthy", 0.037037037037037035], ["major", 0.018518518518518517], ["uniforms", 0.018518518518518517], ["shot", 0.018518518518518517], ["german", 0.018518518518518517], ["africa", 0.018518518518518517], ["moroccan", 0.018518518518518517], ["ukrainians", 0.018518518518518517], ["hanged", 0.018518518518518517], ["scottish", 0.018518518518518517], ["concentration", 0.018518518518518517], ["find", 0.018518518518518517], ["closer", 0.018518518518518517], ["russians", 0.018518518518518517], ["bottom", 0.018518518518518517], ["movie", 0.018518518518518517], ["sides", 0.018518518518518517], ["nepal", 0.018518518518518517], ["camp", 0.018518518518518517], ["glider", 0.018518518518518517], ["machine", 0.018518518518518517], ["finally", 0.018518518518518517], ["squad", 0.018518518518518517], ["call", 0.018518518518518517], ["sergeant", 0.018518518518518517], ["stars", 0.018518518518518517], ["valley", 0.018518518518518517], ["war", 0.018518518518518517], ["north", 0.018518518518518517], ["lunatic", 0.018518518518518517], ["reach", 0.018518518518518517], ["early", 0.018518518518518517], ["wrong", 0.018518518518518517], ["mouth", 0.018518518518518517], ["day", 0.018518518518518517], ["pilot", 0.018518518518518517], ["asylums", 0.018518518518518517], ["spahis", 0.018518518518518517], ["corners", 0.018518518518518517], ["changed", 0.018518518518518517], ["gun", 0.018518518518518517], ["pipe", 0.018518518518518517], ["gurkha", 0.018518518518518517]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThis one?\u201d she said.\n\u201cA sergeant major in the Moroccan Spahis, captured in North Africa,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd this one with a pipe in his mouth?\u201d she said.\n\u201cA Scottish glider pilot captured on D-Day,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just from everywhere, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she said.\n\u201cThis is Gurkha here,\u201d I said, \u201call the way from Nepal.

He sucked the back of his hand, as though nursing a wound. \u201cSlim,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s in that bag?\u201d\nSlim opened the bag and looked inside. \u201cHair, Red,\u201d he said. \u201cRed hair.\u201d\nLITTLE DROPS\nOF WATER\nNow Larry\u2019s gone.\nWe bachelors are lonely people. If I weren\u2019t damn lonely from time to time, I wouldn\u2019t have been a friend of Larry Whiteman, the baritone. Not friend, but companion, meaning I spent time with him, whether I liked him particularly or not. As bachelors get older, I find, they get less and less selective about where they get their companionship\u2014and, like everything else in their lives, friends become a habit, and probably a part of a routine. For instance, while Larry\u2019s monstrous conceit and vanity turned my stomach, I\u2019d been dropping in to see him off and on for years. And when I come to analyze what off and on means, I realize that I saw Larry every Tuesday between five and six in the afternoon. If, on the witness stand, someone were to ask me where I was on the evening of Friday, such and such a date, I would only have to figure out where I would be on the coming Friday to tell him where I had probably been on the Friday he was talking about.\nLet me add quickly that I like women, but am a bachelor by choice. While bachelors are lonely people, I\u2019m convinced that married men are lonely people with dependents.\nWhen I say I like women, I can name names, and perhaps, along with the plea of habit, account for my association with Larry in terms of them. There was Edith Vranken, the Schenectady brewer\u2019s daughter who wanted to sing; Janice Gurnee, the Indianapolis hardware merchant\u2019s daughter who wanted to sing; Beatrix Werner, the Milwaukee consulting engineer\u2019s daughter who wanted to sing; and Ellen Sparks, the Buffalo wholesale grocer\u2019s daughter who wanted to sing.\nI met these attractive young ladies\u2014one by one and in the sequence named\u2014in Larry\u2019s studio, or what anyone else would call apartment. Larry adds to his revenues as a soloist by giving voice lessons to rich and pretty young women who want to sing. While Larry is soft as a hot fudge sundae, he is big and powerful-looking, like a college-bred lumberjack, if there is such a thing, or a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman. His voice, of course, gives the impression that he could powder rocks between his thumb and forefinger. His pupils inevitably fell in love with him. If you ask how they loved him, I can only reply with another question: where in the cycle do you mean? If you mean at the beginning, Larry was loved as a father pro tem. Later, he was loved as a benevolent taskmaster, and finally, as a lover.\nAfter that came what Larry and his friends had come to call graduation, which, in fact, had nothing to do with the pupil\u2019s status as a singer, and had everything to do with the cycle of affections.

I was up in the belfry, checking on the damage. I hadn\u2019t dared to go up there earlier. Somebody might have taken a shot at me, and it could have been a beautiful shot.\nAnd as the helicopters became specks to the north, I was startled to hear a woman speak. She was right behind me. She was small and was shod in white sneakers and had come up ever so quietly. I wasn\u2019t expecting company.\nShe said, \u201cI wondered what it was like up here. Sure is a mess, but the view is nice, if you like water and soldiers.\u201d She sounded tired. We all did.\nI turned to look at her. She was Black. I don\u2019t mean she was so-called Black. Her skin was very dark. She may not have had any white blood whatsoever. If she had been a man at Athena, skin that color would have put her in the lowest social caste.\nSHE WAS SO small and looked so young I mistook her for a Tarkington student, maybe the dyslexic daughter of some overthrown Caribbean or African dictator who had absquatulated to the USA with his starving nation\u2019s treasury.\nWrong again!\nIf the college GRIOT\u2122 had still been working, I am sure it couldn\u2019t have guessed what she was and what she was doing there. She had lived outside all the statistics on which GRIOT\u2122 based its spookily canny guesses. When GRIOT\u2122 was stumped by somebody who had given statistical expectations as wide a berth as she had, it just sat there and hummed. A little red light came on.\nHer name was Helen Dole. She was 26. She was unmarried. She was born in South Korea, and had grown up in what was then West Berlin. She held a Doctorate in Physics from the University of Berlin. Her father had been a Master Sergeant in the Quartermaster Corps of the Regular Army, serving in Korea and then in our Army of Occupation in Berlin. When her father retired after 30 years, to a nice enough little house in a nice enough little neighborhood in Cincinnati, and she saw the horrible squalor and hopelessness into which most black people were born there, she went back to what had become just plain Berlin and earned her Doctorate.\nShe was as badly treated by many people over there as she would have been over here, but at least she didn\u2019t have to think every day about some nearby black ghetto where life expectancy was worse than that in what was said to be the poorest country on the planet, which was Bangladesh.\nTHIS DR. HELEN Dole had come to Scipio only the day before the prison break, to be interviewed by Tex and the Trustees for, of all things, my old job teaching Physics. She had seen the opening advertised in The New York Times. She had talked to Tex on the telephone before she came. She wanted to make sure he knew she was Black. Tex said that was fine, no problem. He said that the fact that she was both female and black, and held a Doctorate besides, was absolutely beautiful.", 0.0256998556998557], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["parking", 0.045112781954887216], ["lot", 0.03759398496240601], ["will", 0.03007518796992481], ["meters", 0.022556390977443608], ["weren", 0.022556390977443608], ["sitting", 0.015037593984962405], ["school", 0.015037593984962405], ["flower", 0.015037593984962405], ["odor", 0.015037593984962405], ["bus", 0.015037593984962405], ["felix", 0.015037593984962405], ["grave", 0.015037593984962405], ["mass", 0.015037593984962405], ["asphalt", 0.007518796992481203], ["rumbling", 0.007518796992481203], ["jimmy", 0.007518796992481203], ["touch", 0.007518796992481203], ["coins", 0.007518796992481203], ["filmed", 0.007518796992481203], ["police", 0.007518796992481203], ["courthouse", 0.007518796992481203], ["conclude", 0.007518796992481203], ["young", 0.007518796992481203], ["crack", 0.007518796992481203], ["municipal", 0.007518796992481203], ["avondale", 0.007518796992481203], ["tricycle", 0.007518796992481203], ["feast", 0.007518796992481203], ["brother", 0.007518796992481203], ["slugs", 0.007518796992481203], ["sidewall", 0.007518796992481203], ["someday", 0.007518796992481203], ["square", 0.007518796992481203], ["house", 0.007518796992481203], ["national", 0.007518796992481203], ["hard", 0.007518796992481203], ["dead", 0.007518796992481203], ["seat", 0.007518796992481203], ["tires", 0.007518796992481203], ["street", 0.007518796992481203], ["sight", 0.007518796992481203], ["saucer", 0.007518796992481203], ["living", 0.007518796992481203], ["stood", 0.007518796992481203], ["movie", 0.007518796992481203], ["waiting", 0.007518796992481203], ["monsters", 0.007518796992481203], ["told", 0.007518796992481203], ["full", 0.007518796992481203], ["dwarf", 0.007518796992481203], ["butts", 0.007518796992481203], ["reason", 0.007518796992481203], ["voice", 0.007518796992481203], ["sniff", 0.007518796992481203], ["meeker", 0.007518796992481203], ["place", 0.007518796992481203], ["pick", 0.007518796992481203], ["block", 0.007518796992481203], ["pistols", 0.007518796992481203], ["love", 0.007518796992481203], ["point", 0.007518796992481203], ["speculated", 0.007518796992481203], ["open", 0.007518796992481203], ["zap", 0.007518796992481203], ["patiently", 0.007518796992481203], ["city", 0.007518796992481203], ["midland", 0.007518796992481203], ["army", 0.007518796992481203], ["caught", 0.007518796992481203], ["flying", 0.007518796992481203], ["beer", 0.007518796992481203], ["master", 0.007518796992481203], ["crews", 0.007518796992481203], ["expected", 0.007518796992481203], ["white", 0.007518796992481203], ["life", 0.007518796992481203], ["door", 0.007518796992481203], ["meekers", 0.007518796992481203], ["inches", 0.007518796992481203], ["park", 0.007518796992481203], ["eyed", 0.007518796992481203], ["arboretum", 0.007518796992481203], ["bug", 0.007518796992481203], ["eden", 0.007518796992481203], ["property", 0.007518796992481203], ["example", 0.007518796992481203], ["engineers", 0.007518796992481203], ["repaved", 0.007518796992481203], ["process", 0.007518796992481203], ["drive", 0.007518796992481203], ["buried", 0.007518796992481203], ["allowed", 0.007518796992481203], ["species", 0.007518796992481203], ["garden", 0.007518796992481203], ["things", 0.007518796992481203], ["wandered", 0.007518796992481203], ["endangered", 0.007518796992481203], ["amazing", 0.007518796992481203], ["unquestionably", 0.007518796992481203], ["wonder", 0.007518796992481203], ["roll", 0.007518796992481203], ["tops", 0.007518796992481203], ["hand", 0.007518796992481203], ["meaning", 0.007518796992481203], ["planet", 0.007518796992481203], ["land", 0.007518796992481203], ["headquarters", 0.007518796992481203], ["mother", 0.007518796992481203], ["shitbox", 0.007518796992481203]], "sentiment": ["We tried very hard not to believe that he could do that.\nBut he could, he could.\nAmazing.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere was no odor. We expected a lot of odor, but there was none. Army engineers had buried all the dead under the block-square municipal parking lot across the street from police headquarters, where the old courthouse had stood. They had then repaved the lot, and put the dwarf arboretum of parking meters back in place. The whole process had been filmed, we were told\u2014from parking lot to mass grave, and then back to parking lot again.\nMy brother Felix, in that rumbling voice of his, speculated that a flying saucer might someday land on the mass grave, and conclude that the whole planet was asphalt, and that parking meters were the only living things. We were sitting in a school bus. We weren\u2019t allowed to get out at that point.\n\u201cMaybe it will look like the Garden of Eden to some bug-eyed monsters,\u201d Felix went on. \u201cThey will love it.

It was as though we were in a national park, full of endangered species. We weren\u2019t even to pick a little flower to sniff. It might be the very last such flower anywhere.\nWhen our school bus took us to Mother\u2019s and my little shitbox out in Avondale, for example, I wandered to the Meekers\u2019 house next door. Young Jimmy Meeker\u2019s tricycle, with white sidewall tires, was sitting in the drive-way, waiting patiently for its master.

primitive and charming conversation in French with Senor Grijalbo, my Spanish publisher. He had no English or German. I had no Spanish. A Frenchman wouldn\u2019t have understood a word we said, but we used it as though it were Morse code, and the messages came through slowly but clearly. I learned that he knew and admired you, and I told him to give you my love. He said you were not easily seen these days. Your good letter of October 9 confirms this.\nI myself am living alone in two rooms and a garden in New York, attempting to draw useful electricity from the millions of milling strangers around me. I am no longer living with Jane for this reason, as nearly as I can tell: We are no longer capable of conducting amiable conversations. When we try to talk, to amuse each other and pass the time, our words are wooden, stilted, queer, distant, and\u2014finally\u2014quietly bitter. That is too bad, and many people regard me as heartless for leaving her. But the hours and days and years dragged so. I am happier now, though far from hilarious and proud. I have achieved a sort of Limbo, which is a distinct improvement over what I had before. I am beginning to write again. That had stopped for a while. I do not wish to marry again. I\u2019m not in love with anybody else. [\u2026]\nI hope that Jane will fall in love and marry again. She\u2019s still beautiful.\nI have become something of a public man. People recognize me sometimes, and I get a lot of invitations to speak. I turn most of them down. One I didn\u2019t turn down came from the American National Academy of the Arts, of which I am not a member. I got to deliver the main address at their annual meeting a couple of months ago. I was petrified.\nYou promised good news, Pepe. Here\u2019s some from me: I am working on a project for which I am being paid almost nothing, but which amuses me for days on end. The National Educational Television Network, which is America\u2019s non-commercial TV operation, has hired me to write a 90-minute show about a space shot, which will be shown three days before America has a real space shot next March. We think our space shot will be infinitely cheaper than the real thing, and a lot more interesting.\nLove to Maria Pilar\u2014\nKurt\nNovember 13, 1971\nNew York City\nTO NANNY VONNEGUT", 0.1996887479445619], "title": "Letters"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["sold", 0.038461538461538464], ["document", 0.02564102564102564], ["king", 0.02564102564102564], ["control", 0.01282051282051282], ["enjoy", 0.01282051282051282], ["ant", 0.01282051282051282], ["duke", 0.01282051282051282], ["acknowledged", 0.01282051282051282], ["hare", 0.01282051282051282], ["turned", 0.01282051282051282], ["dead", 0.01282051282051282], ["sign", 0.01282051282051282], ["states", 0.01282051282051282], ["addressed", 0.01282051282051282], ["mott", 0.01282051282051282], ["directly", 0.01282051282051282], ["reunion", 0.01282051282051282], ["north", 0.01282051282051282], ["weeniest", 0.01282051282051282], ["captain", 0.01282051282051282], ["oriole", 0.01282051282051282], ["continent", 0.01282051282051282], ["teeny", 0.01282051282051282], ["united", 0.01282051282051282], ["prepare", 0.01282051282051282], ["49", 0.01282051282051282], ["surprises", 0.01282051282051282], ["occupied", 0.01282051282051282], ["urbana", 0.01282051282051282], ["unknown", 0.01282051282051282], ["young", 0.01282051282051282], ["long", 0.01282051282051282], ["illinois", 0.01282051282051282], ["write", 0.01282051282051282], ["oklahoma", 0.01282051282051282], ["doubt", 0.01282051282051282], ["health", 0.01282051282051282], ["scribes", 0.01282051282051282], ["louisiana", 0.01282051282051282], ["michigan", 0.01282051282051282], ["surprised", 0.01282051282051282], ["head", 0.01282051282051282], ["good", 0.01282051282051282], ["wished", 0.01282051282051282], ["purchase", 0.01282051282051282], ["dollar", 0.01282051282051282], ["exercised", 0.01282051282051282], ["potentates", 0.01282051282051282], ["historic", 0.01282051282051282], ["ho", 0.01282051282051282], ["baby", 0.01282051282051282], ["president", 0.01282051282051282], ["america", 0.01282051282051282], ["chatted", 0.01282051282051282], ["napoleon", 0.01282051282051282], ["sister", 0.01282051282051282], ["territory", 0.01282051282051282], ["join", 0.01282051282051282], ["longer", 0.01282051282051282], ["electronic", 0.01282051282051282], ["country", 0.01282051282051282], ["bonaparte", 0.01282051282051282], ["list", 0.01282051282051282], ["signed", 0.01282051282051282], ["grandfather", 0.01282051282051282], ["looked", 0.01282051282051282], ["american", 0.01282051282051282], ["panjandrums", 0.01282051282051282], ["speaking", 0.01282051282051282], ["signature", 0.01282051282051282], ["stewart", 0.01282051282051282], ["laughter", 0.01282051282051282], ["1803", 0.01282051282051282], ["history", 0.01282051282051282]], "sentiment": ["He did not join my laughter.\nI addressed his scribes directly, speaking over his head. \u201cHistory is merely a list of surprises,\u201d I said. \u201cIt can only prepare us to be surprised yet again.
