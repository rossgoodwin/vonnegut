This was a woman and, as she told me on the telephone: she was the first female safety inspector for her company, and also the first black. \u201cI am two birds with one stone,\u201d she said, and she laughed. She had a very nice laugh. There was no malice or mockery in it. In offering to return my canvases to me after all those years, with the absent-minded approval of Matsumoto, she was simply expressing her reluctance to see anything go to waste.\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one who cares one way or another,\u201d she said, \u201cso you tell me what to do. You\u2019d have to pick them up yourself,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHow did you know what they were?\u201d I said.\nShe had been a prenursing student at Skidmore College, she said, and had taken, as one of her precious few electives, a course in art appreciation. She was a registered nurse like my first wife Dorothy, but had given up that profession because doctors, she said, treated her like an idiot and a slave. Also: the hours were long and the pay was low, and she had an orphaned niece to support and keep company.\nHer art appreciation teacher showed slides of famous pictures, and two of these were of \u201cWindsor Blue Number Seventeen,\u201d before and after it fell apart.\n\u201cHow can I thank him?\u201d I said.\n\u201cI think he was trying to lighten up the course,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rest of it was so serious.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want the canvases or not?\u201d she said. There was a long silence, so she finally said, \u201cHello? Hello?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cThat may seem like a simple question to you, but it\u2019s a biggie to me. To me it\u2019s as though you called me up out of the blue on a day like any other day, and asked me if I was grown up yet.\u201d\nIf harmless objects like those rectangles of stretched canvas were hobgoblins to me, could fill me with shame, yes, with rage at a world which had entrapped me into being a failure and a laughingstock and so on, then I wasn\u2019t a grown-up yet, although I was then sixty-eight years old.", 0.09886666666666667], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["daddy", 0.16129032258064516], ["red", 0.06451612903225806], ["nancy", 0.053763440860215055], ["hair", 0.03225806451612903], ["eddie", 0.021505376344086023], ["head", 0.021505376344086023], ["big", 0.021505376344086023], ["break", 0.021505376344086023], ["word", 0.021505376344086023], ["mother", 0.021505376344086023], ["settled", 0.021505376344086023], ["honor", 0.021505376344086023], ["mimicked", 0.010752688172043012], ["married", 0.010752688172043012], ["eh", 0.010752688172043012], ["pops", 0.010752688172043012], ["scudder", 0.010752688172043012], ["year", 0.010752688172043012], ["proudly", 0.010752688172043012], ["play", 0.010752688172043012], ["years", 0.010752688172043012], ["accusation", 0.010752688172043012], ["course", 0.010752688172043012], ["sudden", 0.010752688172043012], ["violet", 0.010752688172043012], ["girl", 0.010752688172043012], ["sky", 0.010752688172043012], ["cocked", 0.010752688172043012], ["clucked", 0.010752688172043012], ["voyage", 0.010752688172043012], ["things", 0.010752688172043012], ["boot", 0.010752688172043012], ["nosir", 0.010752688172043012], ["school", 0.010752688172043012], ["pretty", 0.010752688172043012], ["nice", 0.010752688172043012], ["real", 0.010752688172043012], ["wouldn", 0.010752688172043012], ["families", 0.010752688172043012], ["watchfully", 0.010752688172043012], ["girls", 0.010752688172043012], ["time", 0.010752688172043012], ["kind", 0.010752688172043012], ["hand", 0.010752688172043012], ["lunch", 0.010752688172043012], ["piously", 0.010752688172043012], ["gee", 0.010752688172043012], ["daughter", 0.010752688172043012], ["wanted", 0.010752688172043012], ["died", 0.010752688172043012], ["high", 0.010752688172043012], ["great", 0.010752688172043012], ["wagged", 0.010752688172043012], ["drop", 0.010752688172043012], ["grinned", 0.010752688172043012], ["told", 0.010752688172043012], ["guessed", 0.010752688172043012], ["smart", 0.010752688172043012], ["serious", 0.010752688172043012], ["blushed", 0.010752688172043012]], "sentiment": ["\u201cEverybody says so,\u201d said Nancy proudly. \u201cNot just Daddy and me.\u201d\n\u201cDaddy, eh?\u201d said Red.

I did not tell them that there had been a mass prison break and that Scipio had been overrun by criminals. Such information would have beer useless to them, would have been like more TV.
