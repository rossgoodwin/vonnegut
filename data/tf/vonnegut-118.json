I\u2019ve only had two ideas, and both are very likely lousy. The first would be to require workshop people to study some other art form, music, painting, or whatever. The second would be to create a seminar for a tiny core of students who, like MacMillan, can already write like crazy. If we had such an elite, the workshop could maintain its fancy reputation no matter how many poor students got in.\nMy wife and I had dinner with Dan Boorstin and Murray Krieger\u2019s brother a week ago\u2014in Chicago.

I am a philosopher. I have to be.\nInto the news store I go. Relatively poor people, with lives not strikingly worth living, are lined up to buy lottery tickets or other crap. All keep their cool. They pretend they don\u2019t know I\u2019m a celebrity.\nThe store is a Ma-and-Pa joint owned by Hindus, honest-to-God Hindus! The woman has a teeny-weeny ruby between her eyes. That\u2019s worth a trip. Who needs an envelope?\nYou must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is still a sigh.\nI know the Hindus\u2019 stock of stationery as well as they do. I didn\u2019t study anthropology for nothing. I find one nine-by-twelve manila envelope without assistance, remembering simultaneously a joke about the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The Cubs were supposedly moving to the Philippine Islands, where they would be renamed the Manila Folders. That would have been a good joke about the Boston Red Sox, too.\nI take my place at the end of the line, chatting with fellow customers who are buying something other than lottery tickets. The lottery ticket suckers, decorticated by hope and numerology, may as well be victims of Post-Timequake Apathy. You could run them over with an eighteen-wheeler. They wouldn\u2019t care.\n57\nFrom the news store I go one block south to the Postal Convenience Station, where I am secretly in love with a woman behind the counter. I have already put my pages in the manila envelope. I address it, and then I take my place at the end of another long line. What I need now is postage! Yum, yum, yum!\nThe woman I love there does not know I love her. You want to talk about poker faces? When her eyes meet mine, she might as well be looking at a cantaloupe!\nBecause she works sitting down, and because of the counter and the smock she wears, all I have ever seen of her is from the neck up.

Soldier,\" he ordered the young corporal, \"step forward one square.\" There\u2014it was all he could do. Now there was no advantage in Pi Ying\u2019s taking the pawn he threatened\u2014the sergeant. Tactically it would be a pointless trade, pawn for pawn. No advantage so far as good chess went.\n\"This is very bad form, I know,\" said Pi Ying blandly. He paused. \"Well, then again, I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019d be wise to trade. With so brilliant an opponent, perhaps I\u2019d better play flawless chess, and forget the many temptations.\" Major Barzov murmured something to him. \"But it would get us into the spirit of the game right off, wouldn\u2019t it?\"\n\"What\u2019s he talking about, sir?\" asked the sergeant apprehensively.\nBefore Kelly could order his thoughts, Pi Ying gave the order. \"Take his king\u2019s pawn.\"\n\"Colonel! What\u2019d you do?\" cried the sergeant. Two guards pulled him from the board and out of the room. A studded door banged shut behind them.\n\"Kill me!\" shouted Kelly, starting off his square after them. A half-dozen bayonets hemmed him in.\nImpassively, the servant slid Pi Ying\u2019s wooden pawn onto the square where the sergeant had stood. A shot reverberated on the other side of the thick door, and the guards reappeared. Pi Ying was no longer smiling. \"Your move, Colonel. Come, come\u2014four minutes have gone already.\"\nKelly\u2019s calm was shattered, and with it went the illusion of the game. The pieces in his power were human beings again. The precious, brutal stuff of command was gone from Colonel Kelly. He was no more fit to make decisions of life and death than the rawest recruit. Giddily, he realized that Pi Ying\u2019s object was not to win the game quickly, but to thin out the Americans in harrowing, pointless forays. Another two minutes crept by as he struggled to force himself to be rational. \"I can\u2019t do it,\" he whispered at last. He slouched now.\n\"You wish me to have all of you shot right now?\" asked Pi Ying. \"I must say that I find you a rather pathetic colonel. Do all American officers give in so easily?\"\n\"Pin his ears back, Colonel,\" said the pilot. \"Let\u2019s go. Sharpen up.

"sentiment": ["To certain sorts of big brains back in those days, her experience with aviation might have been something to laugh about. She was anything but graceful.\nAnd when she was set down on the deck of the San Mateo, she was so severely injured that she could no longer stand. But that was to be expected, and perfectly acceptable. Long experience had shown sailors that cattle so treated could go on living for a week or more, would keep their own meat from rotting until it was time for them to be eaten. What had been done to that dairy cow was a shorter version of what used to be done to great land tortoises back in the days of sailing ships.\nIn either case, there was no need for refrigeration.\nThe happy Colombianos were chewing and swallowing some of that poor cow\u2019s meat when they were blown to bits by the latest advance in the evolution of high explosives, which was called \u201cdagonite.\u201d Dagonite was the son, so to speak, of a considerably weaker explosive made by the same company, and called \u201cglacco.\u201d Glacco begat dagonite, so to speak, and both were descendants of Greek fire and gunpowder and dynamite and cordite and TNT.\nSo it might be said that the Colombianos had treated the cow abominably, but that retribution had been swift and terrible, thanks largely to the big-brained inventors of dagonite.\nIn view of how badly the Colombianos had treated the cow, Major Ricardo Cortez, flying faster than sound, might be seen as a virtuous knight as in days of yore. And he felt that way about himself, too, although he knew nothing about the cow or what his rocket had hit. He radioed back to his superiors that the Bah\u00eda de Darwin was destroyed. He asked that his best friend, Lieutenant Colonel Reyes, who was back on the ground and who had turned a rocket loose on the airport that afternoon, be given this message in Spanish: It is true.\nReyes would understand that he was agreeing that letting the rocket go had been as elating as sexual intercourse. And he would never find out that he had not hit the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, and the friends and relatives of the Colombianos who were blown to hamburger in the estuary would never learn what became of them.\nThe rocket which hit the airport was surely a lot more effective in Darwinian terms than the one that hit the San Mateo. It killed thousands of people and birds and dogs and cats and rats and mice and so on, who would otherwise have reproduced their own kind.\nThe blast in the marsh killed only the fourteen crewmen and about five hundred rats on the ship, and a few hundred birds, and some crabs and fish and so on.\nMainly, though, it was an ineffectual assault on the very bottom of the food chain, the billions upon billions of microorganisms who, along with their own excrement and the corpses of their ancestors, comprised the muck of the marsh. The explosion didn\u2019t bother them much, since they weren\u2019t all that sensitive to sudden starts and stops. They could never have committed suicide in the manner as *Siegfried von Kleist, at the wheel of the bus, intended to commit suicide, with a sudden stop.", 0.17103852258852253], "title": "Galapagos"},

any of the companies which had come to know me as Dan Gregory\u2019s messenger boy. He had told them, I imagine, although I have no proof of this, that I was self-serving, disloyal, untalented, and so on. True enough. Jobs were so scarce anyway, so why should they give one to anyone as unlike themselves as an Armenian? Let the Armenians take care of their own unemployed.\nAnd it was, in fact, an Armenian who came to my rescue while I was caricaturing willing sitters in Central Park\u2014for the price of a cup of coffee and little more. He was neither a Turkish nor a Russian Armenian, but a Bulgarian Armenian, whose parents had taken him to Paris, France, in his infancy. He and they had become members of the lively and prosperous Armenian community in that city, then the Art Capital of the World. As I have said, my own parents and I would have become Parisians, too, had we not been diverted to San Ignacio, California, by the criminal Vartan Mamigonian. My savior\u2019s original name had been Marktich Kouyoumdjian, subsequently Frenchified to Marc Coulomb.\nThe Coulombs, then as now, were giants in the tourist industry, with travel agencies all over the world, and orchestrators of tours to almost anywhere. When he struck up a conversation with me in Central Park, Marc Coulomb was only twenty-five, and had been sent from Paris to find an advertising agency to make his family\u2019s services better known in the U.S.A. He admired my facility with drawing materials, and said that, if I really wished to become an artist, I would have to come to Paris.\nThere was an irony lying in wait in the distant future, of course: I would eventually become a member of that small group of painters which would make New York City and not Paris the Art Capital of the World.\nPurely on the basis of race prejudice, I think, one Armenian taking care of another, he bought me a suit, a shirt, a necktie, and a new pair of shoes, and took me to the advertising agency he liked best, which was Leidveld and Moore. He told them they could have the Coulomb account if they would hire me as an artist. Which they did.\nI never saw or heard from him again. But guess what? On this very morning, as I am thinking about Marc Coulomb hard for the first time in half a century, The New York Times carries his obituary. He was a hero of the French Resistance, they say, and was, at the time of his death, chairman of the board of Coulomb Fr\u00e8res et Cie, the most extensive travel organization in the world.\nWhat a coincidence!

I should model myself after other Americans. I now have mixed feelings about such advice. It hasn\u2019t always been convenient or attractive to comport myself as the purely American person I am.\nSince I am simultaneously a humorist and a serious novelist, I was asked to speak at the one hundredth anniversary of the completion of Mark Twain\u2019s fanciful house in Hartford, Connecticut. The celebration took place on April 30, 1979. As a special honor to me, balls had been racked up on Mark Twain\u2019s pool table on the third floor. I was to be allowed to break them with Mark Twain\u2019s own cue. I declined.

donor, Miss Hanson, was the last to arrive. She and her wheelchair were set down on the top step outside. Then all 3 sets of doors between Pam\u2019s bagladies and the North Pole were thrown open wide. So all the bagladies were blown off their pedestals. They wound up on the floor, piled up against the hollow baseboards which concealed hot heating pipes.\nTV cameras caught everything but the smell of hot polyurethane. What a relief from mundane worries! Who says the news has to be nothing but grim day after day?\n24\nPAMELA WAS SULKING next to the stable. The stable wasn\u2019t in the shadow of Musket Mountain yet. It would be another 7 hours before the Sun went down.\nThis was years before the prison break, but there were already 2 bodies and 1 human head buried out that way. Everybody knew about the 2 bodies, which had been interred with honors and topped with a tombstone. The head would come as a complete surprise when more graves were dug with a backhoe at the end of the prison break.\nWhose head was it?\nTHE 2 BODIES everybody knew about belonged to Tarkington\u2019s first teacher of Botany and German and the flute, the brewmaster Hermann Shultz and his wife Sophia. They died within 1 day of each other during a diphtheria epidemic in 1893. They were in fairly fresh graves the day I was fired, although their joint grave marker was 98 years old. Their bodies and tombstone were moved there to make room for the Pahlavi Pavilion.\nThe mortician from down in town who took charge of moving the bodies back in 1987 reported that they were remarkably well preserved. He invited me to look, but I told him I was willing to take his word for it.\nCAN YOU IMAGINE that? After all the corpses I saw in Vietnam, and in many cases created, I was squeamish about looking at 2 more which had absolutely nothing to do with me. I am at a loss for an explanation. Maybe I was thinking like an innocent little boy again.\nI have leafed through the Atheist\u2019s Bible, Bartlett\u2019s Familiar Quotations, for some sort of comment on unexpected squeamishness.

A small cocktail party was in progress. As I was skirting the house, wondering how to get into it, I heard somebody tapping on the inside of a glass wall above. I looked up to see the most startling and, in a bizarre way, one of the most beautiful women of my experience.\nShe was tall and slender, with a subtly muscled figure sheathed in a zebra-striped leotard. Her hair was bleached silver and touched with blue, and in the white and perfect oval of her face were eyes of glittering green, set off by painted eyebrows, jet black and arched. She wore one earring, a barbaric gold hoop. She was making spiral motions with her hand, and I understood at last that I was to climb the spiral ramp that wound around the brick cylinder.\nThe ramp brought me up to a catwalk outside the glass walls. A towering, vigorous man in his early thirties slid back a glass panel and invited me in. He wore lavender nylon coveralls and sandals.
