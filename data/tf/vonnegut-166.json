I was also visited by officers who impressed on me how important it was that I not tell anyone what had happened in the village. Only then did I learn that our platoon had killed fifty-nine villagers of all ages. Somebody had counted them afterwards.\nWhile on a pass from the hospital, I contracted syphilis from a Saigon prostitute while drunk and also high on marijuana. But the first lesion of that disease, another one unknown in the present day, did not appear until I reached Bangkok, Thailand, where I was sent with many others for so-called \u201cRest and Recreation.\u201d This was a euphemism understood by one and all to mean more whores and drugs and alcohol. Prostitution was then a major earner of foreign currency in Thailand, second only to rice.\nAfter that came rubber.\nAfter that came teak.\nAfter that came tin.\nI did not want the Marine Corps to know that I had syphilis. If they found out about it, they would dock my pay during the time I was under treatment. The treatment period, moreover, would be tacked on to the year I was supposed to serve in Vietnam.\nSo I sought the services of a private physician in Bangkok. A fellow Marine there recommended a young Swedish doctor who treated cases like mine, who was doing research at the University of Medical Sciences there.\nDuring my first visit, he questioned me about the war. I found myself telling him about what our platoon had done to the village and villagers. He wanted to know what I had felt, and I replied that the most terrible part of the experience to me was that I hadn\u2019t felt much of anything.\n\u201cDid you cry afterwards, or have trouble sleeping?\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d I said. \u201cIn fact, I was hospitalized because all I wanted to do was sleep.\u201d", 0.08517857142857142], "title": "Galapagos"},

They are simply liking machines and hating machines.\n\u201cYou are pooped and demoralized,\u201d read Dwayne. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you be? Of course it is exhausting, having to reason all the time in a universe which wasn\u2019t meant to be reasonable.\u201d\n23\nDWAYNE HOOVER read on: \u201cYou are surrounded by loving machines, hating machines, greedy machines, unselfish machines, brave machines, cowardly machines, truthful machines, lying machines, funny machines, solemn machines,\u201d he read. \u201cTheir only purpose is to stir you up in every conceivable way, so the Creator of the Universe can watch your reactions. They can no more feel or reason than grandfather clocks.\n\u201cThe Creator of the Universe would now like to apologize not only for the capricious, jostling companionship he provided during the test, but for the trashy, stinking condition of the planet itself. The Creator programmed robots to abuse it for millions of years, so it would be a poisonous, festering cheese when you got here. Also, He made sure it would be desperately crowded by programming robots, regardless of their living conditions, to crave sexual intercourse and adore infants more than almost anything.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMary Alice Miller, incidentally, the Women\u2019s Breast Stroke Champion of the World and Queen of the Arts Festival, now passed through the cocktail lounge.

He had just come off duty.\nThe air of the lunchroom was cut by a cruel screech from a dry bearing in the revolving stool as Red turned away from his coffee and hamburger, and looked up at the bridge expectantly.

When Red\u2019s eyes met theirs briefly, Red sniffed, and returned his attention to his food. He toyed with his tableware, and the big muscles in his forearms fretted under his tattoos, under intertwined symbols of bloodlust and love\u2014daggers and hearts.\nThe counterman, egged on by nods from the other three customers, spoke to Red with great politeness. \u201cExcuse me, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cbut are you Red Mayo?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s who I am,\u201d said Red, without looking

close these days, and think of themselves as genuine brothers and sisters. They are lucky to have so many interested and responsive relatives. There are many affectionate reunions a year in the big old house on Cape Cod where they were raised together. They were such a formidable gang when they were young that one policeman became a specialist in their habits and haunts. He had a lovely name, and always left his blue flasher on when he parked in our yard. His name was Sergeant Nightingale.\nWhenever Sergeant Nightingale came to interrogate this child or that one, the flasher on his cruiser splashed our house with blue as it went around and around.\nNobody ever went to prison, though.\nNobody ever dealt dope.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere was only one really fancy auto smashup. Mark rolled and totaled a Volkswagen Microbus with about eight people in it. It scattered people out along the shoulder of the road the way a saltshaker will scatter salt. People flew out through the sun roof, out through the side doors, out through the tailgate. Mark was the last one to fly out. He landed on his feet, and found himself facing oncoming traffic like a football lineman.\nNobody was killed or seriously hurt, thank God.\nJim Adams was not the only one of my children to come close to actual combat with a major literary figure. About the time Jim and Yevtushenko were menacing each other on the Amazon, Mark Vonnegut was considering a fight with Jack Kerouac in our kitchen on Cape Cod. These confrontations even took place in the same time zone, but in different hemispheres.\nI knew Kerouac only at the end of his life, which is to say there was no way for me to know him at all, since he had become a pinwheel. He had settled briefly on Cape Cod, and a mutual friend, the writer Robert Boles, brought him over to my house one night. I doubt that Kerouac knew anything about me or my work, or even where he was. He was crazy. He called Boles, who is black, \u201ca blue-gummed nigger.\u201d He said that Jews were the real Nazis, and that Allen Ginsberg had been told by the Communists to befriend Kerouac, in order that they might gain control of American young people, whose leader he was.", 0.05820707070707071], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["street", 0.03867403314917127], ["prison",

back in his homeland. The closest he came to doing that was when he told me 1 night that the ruins of the locks at the head of the lake, with huge timbers and boulders tumbled this way and that, might have been the creation of a great Japanese gardener.\nIn the Japanese Army of Occupation he was a high-ranking officer, the civilian peer of a Brigadier, maybe, or even a Major General. But he reminded me of several old Master Sergeants I had known in Vietnam. They would say worse things about the Army and the war and the Vietnamese than anybody. But I would go away for a couple of years, and then come back, and they were all still there, crabbing away. They wouldn\u2019t leave until the Vietnamese either killed them or kicked them out of there.\nHow they hated home. They were more afraid of home than of the enemy.\nHIROSHI MATSUMOTO CALLED this valley a \u201chellhole\u201d and the \u201canus of the Universe.\u201d But he didn\u2019t leave it until he was kicked out of here.\nI wonder if the Mohiga Valley hadn\u2019t become the only home he ever knew after the bombing of Hiroshima. He lives in retirement now in his reconstructed native city, having lost both feet to frostbite after the prison break. Is it possible that he is thinking now what I have thought so often: \u201cWhat is this place and who are these people, and what am I doing here?\u201d\nTHE LAST TIME I saw him was on the night of the prison break. We had been awakened by the racket of the Jamaicans\u2019 assault on the prison. We both came running out onto the street in front of our houses barefoot and in our nightclothes, although the temperature must have been minus 10 degrees centigrade.\nThe name of our main street in the ghost town was Clinton Street, the name of the main street in Scipio. Can you imagine that: two communities so close geographically, and yet in olden times so separate socially and economically that, with all the street names they might have chosen, they both named their main street Clinton Street?\nTHE WARDEN TRIED to reach the prison on a cordless telephone. He got no answer. His 3 house servants were looking out at us from upstairs windows. They were convicts over 70 years old, serving life sentences without hope of parole, long forgotten by the outside world, and coked to the gills on Thor-azine.\nMy mother-in-law came out on our porch. She called to me, \u201cTell him about the fish I caught! Tell him about that fish I caught!\u201d\nThe Warden said to me that a boiler up at the prison must have blown, or maybe the crematorium. It sounded to me like military weaponry, whose voices he had never heard. He hadn\u2019t even heard the atomic bomb go off.
