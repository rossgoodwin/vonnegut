the story of a writer\u2019s life\u2014a writer whose influence is still widely felt throughout the world and, by every indication, will continue to be felt for a long time to come. They are as personal, as witty, as entertaining, and as disarmingly profound as the work he published in novels, stories, articles, and essays. No outside interpreter will ever be able to express this life as truly and as deeply as these letters he wrote to his children, his friends, his publishers, his academic advocates, his critics, and those who sought to ban his work.\nReading these letters has allowed me to know my friend Kurt Vonnegut better and to appreciate him even more. Nothing came easy for him. Nothing deterred him\u2014not the many editors and publishers who rejected his books and stories; not the anthropology department of the University of Chicago, which rejected not one but two of the theses he wrote for his M.A. degree (awarding it to him only after he was famous); not the Guggenheim Foundation, which rejected his first application for a fellowship; not the doubting relatives and friends from home like his uncle Alex, who said he couldn\u2019t read The Sirens of Titan, after Kurt had dedicated the book to him, or his aunt Ella Stewart, who would not stock his books in the bookstore she owned in Louisville, Kentucky, because she found them degenerate; not his Cape Cod neighbors who didn\u2019t read his books and expressed no interest in what he did for a living; not the school boards that banned his books (and in one case burned them in a furnace) without ever reading them; not the academic critics who spurned and dismissed him; not the backbiting reviewers who tried to drag him down after he became famous; not the bureaucrats he battled for the rights of writers throughout the world; not the right-wing Christian religious groups that condemned this man who described Jesus Christ as \u201cthe greatest and most humane of human beings.\u201d Anyone who imagines a writer\u2019s life has ever been easy\u2014even one who eventually achieves fame and fortune\u2014will be disabused of that fantasy after reading these letters. And they will be inspired.\nI first heard the name Kurt Vonnegut in the spring of 1950, my senior year at Shortridge High School in Indianapolis, when I admitted to a teacher that I wanted to be a writer. His brows furrowed in concern, he rubbed his chin for a moment, nodded, and said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s one boy did that\u2014boy named Vonnegut.\u201d I learned that \u201cthe Vonnegut boy,\u201d who got his start writing for the Shortridge Daily Echo, had published his first short story in Collier\u2019s magazine earlier that year. To me, that meant he had reached Mount Olympus.\nNeither that high school teacher nor anyone else in the world\u2014with the exception of his childhood sweetheart and high school classmate, Jane Marie Cox, who became his first wife and the mother of his first three children\u2014believed that Vonnegut would become a world-famous writer whose work would be translated into all the major languages of the world. His oldest son, Mark, wrote in his memoir, Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So, that during the years of Kurt\u2019s struggles, \u201cMy mother \u2026 knew my father was going to be famous and it was all going to be worth it. She believed more than he did that he would someday be a famous writer.\u2026\u201d\nGrowing up in Indianapolis in the 1930s and \u201940s, my friends and I and our families all knew the name Vonnegut\u2014the Vonnegut Hardware Company had its headquarters downtown, and there were branches throughout the city. In summers during high school, Kurt worked at the main store for his great-uncle Franklin Vonnegut, making up packages in the shipping room and for a while running a freight elevator. He later wrote to a fan in Indianapolis who had also worked in that store: \u201cMy idea of hell was shaped by that experience. Hell is running an elevator throughout eternity in a building with only six floors.\u201d But he respected the company begun by his ancestors, commenting in Palm Sunday: \u201cI liked what we sold. It was honest and practical.\u201d\nI knew as a kid what the Vonneguts had contributed to the city in terms of business, but I was ignorant until much later of the family\u2019s immense cultural contributions. Kurt\u2019s great-grandfather, Clemens Vonnegut, emigrated from Germany in 1848 and settled in Indianapolis in 1850 and not only established the Vonnegut Hardware Company but also became a major influence in the city\u2019s cultural affairs. He founded the Freethinker\u2019s Society of Indianapolis and the Indianapolis Turngemeinde, the center for German culture and gymnastics in Indianapolis. It later became known as the Athenaeum Turners, serving the whole community and offering theater, lectures, and music as well as gymnastics. The building that houses it today is called the Athenaeum.\nClemens served on the school board of the city and became its chairman; he was a strong advocate of public education, seeing to it that classics, history, and social sciences were part of the curriculum. A believer in physical fitness, he exercised daily in all weathers, carrying large rocks in each hand, dropping them to chin himself on low-hanging tree limbs. Little wonder that Kurt found Clemens, a skeptic who wrote his own funeral oration, \u201cthe ancestor who most beguiles me.\u201d Noting that Clemens was described as \u201ca cultivated eccentric,\u201d Kurt wrote in Palm Sunday: \u201cThat\u2019s what I aspire to be.\u201d Both Kurt\u2019s grandfather Bernard (\u201cwho didn\u2019t like the trade in nails\u201d) and his own father, Kurt, Sr., aspired to do something in the arts and became prominent architects in Indianapolis. Bernard Vonnegut, the first licensed architect in Indiana, and his partner, Arthur Bohn, designed some of the most important buildings in the city, including the John Herron Art Museum, Shortridge High School, and the Athenaeum. The year Bernard died, his son, Kurt, Sr., graduated from M.I.T. and returned home to become an architect and join his late father\u2019s partner in the business.\nIn a speech at the Athenaeum in 1996, Kurt told his audience: \u201cI bring you a piece of Indianapolis history that may astonish you. This landmark building, designed by my grandfather Bernard Vonnegut, who I never knew, wasn\u2019t always called the Athenaeum. Some people, I\u2019ve heard, splashed yellow paint on its fa\u00e7ade when it was called something else.\u201d\nIt was originally called Das Deutsche Haus, but in the anti-German sentiment that swept the country during World War I, its named was changed. (Today the popular restaurant in the building, the Rathskeller, boasts a \u201cVonnegut Room,\u201d with a bust of the author.) Anything German was viewed with suspicion or hostility throughout the country during the war; in Indianapolis, which owed much of its cultural heritage to its German families, the city orchestra was disbanded because the soprano soloist was German, the restaurants serving German food renamed their kartoffel salad \u201cliberty cabbage,\u201d and the board of education stopped the teaching of German in the schools.\n\u201cAt about the same time as the yellow-paint monkey business,\u201d Vonnegut continued, \u201cmy father, Kurt, who had been Bernard Vonnegut\u2019s partner in architecture, received an anonymous note telling him, \u2018Stop teaching your kids Dutch.\u2019 And he did.\u2026\u201d", 0.18660488816738816], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["chapter", 0.5], ["39", 0.05], ["38", 0.05], ["46", 0.05], ["42", 0.05], ["44", 0.05], ["45", 0.05], ["37", 0.05], ["43", 0.05], ["40", 0.05], ["41", 0.05]], "sentiment": ["Chapter 37\nChapter 38\nChapter 39\nChapter 40\nChapter 41\nChapter 42\nChapter 43\nChapter 44\nChapter 45\nChapter 46", 0.0], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["charlotte", 0.029411764705882353], ["finest", 0.029411764705882353], ["observer", 0.029411764705882353], ["celebration", 0.029411764705882353], ["defense", 0.029411764705882353], ["names", 0.029411764705882353], ["laugh", 0.029411764705882353], ["conjuring", 0.029411764705882353], ["best", 0.029411764705882353], ["monthly", 0.029411764705882353], ["review", 0.029411764705882353], ["fantasies", 0.029411764705882353], ["writers", 0.029411764705882353], ["black", 0.029411764705882353], ["medicine", 0.029411764705882353], ["humorist", 0.029411764705882353], ["satirist", 0.029411764705882353], ["map", 0.029411764705882353], ["lessing", 0.029411764705882353], ["unimitative", 0.029411764705882353], ["warn", 0.029411764705882353], ["atlantic", 0.029411764705882353], ["york", 0.029411764705882353], ["inimitable", 0.029411764705882353], ["unique", 0.029411764705882353], ["man", 0.029411764705882353], ["places", 0.029411764705882353], ["times", 0.029411764705882353], ["harper", 0.029411764705882353], ["magazine", 0.029411764705882353], ["social", 0.029411764705882353], ["landscapes", 0.029411764705882353], ["book", 0.029411764705882353], ["doris", 0.029411764705882353]], "sentiment": ["\"UNIQUE... one of the writers who map our landscapes for us, who give names to the places we know best.\"\n\u2014DORIS LESSING\nThe New York Times Book Review\n\"OUR FINEST BLACK-HUMORIST. ...

ONLY story of mine whose moral I know. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a marvelous moral; I simply happen to know what it is: We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\nMy personal experience with Nazi monkey business was limited. There were some vile and lively native American Fascists in my home town of Indianapolis during the thirties, and somebody slipped me a copy of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, I remember, which was supposed to be the Jews\u2019 secret plan for taking over the world. And I remember some laughs about my aunt, too, who married a German German, and who had to write to Indianapolis for proofs that she had no Jewish blood. The Indianapolis mayor knew her from high school and dancing school, so he had fun putting ribbons and official seals all over the documents the Germans required, which made them look like eighteenth-century peace treaties.\nAfter a while the war came, and I was in it, and I was captured, so I got to see a little of Germany from the inside while the war was still going on. I was a private, a battalion scout, and, under the terms of the Geneva Convention, I had to work for my keep, which was good, not bad. I didn\u2019t have to stay in prison all the time, somewhere out in the countryside. I got to go to a city, which was Dresden, and to see the people and the things they did.\nThere were about a hundred of us in our particular work group, and we were put out as contract labor to a factory that was making a vitamin-enriched malt syrup for pregnant women. It tasted like thin honey laced with hickory smoke. It was good. I wish I had some right now. And the city was lovely, highly ornamented, like Paris, and untouched by war. It was supposedly an \u201copen\u201d city, not to be attacked since there were no troop concentrations or war industries there.\nBut high explosives were dropped on Dresden by American and British planes on the night of February 13, 1945, just about twenty-one years ago, as I now write. There were no particular targets for the bombs. The hope was that they would create a lot of kindling and drive firemen underground.\nAnd then hundreds of thousands of tiny incendiaries were scattered over the kindling, like seeds on freshly turned loam. More bombs were dropped to keep firemen in their holes, and all the little fires grew, joined one another, became one apocalyptic flame. Hey presto: fire storm. It was the largest massacre in European history, by the way. And so what?\nWe didn\u2019t get to see the fire storm. We were in a cool meat-locker under a slaughterhouse with our six guards and ranks and ranks of dressed cadavers of cattle, pigs, horses, and sheep. We heard the bombs walking around up there. Now and then there would be a gentle shower of calcimine. If we had gone above to take a look, we would have been turned into artifacts characteristic of fire storms: seeming pieces of charred firewood two or three feet long\u2014ridiculously small human beings, or jumbo fried grasshoppers, if you will.", 0.11968802936194242], "title": "Mother Night"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["sirens", 0.05555555555555555], ["jailbird", 0.05555555555555555], ["rosewater", 0.05555555555555555], ["titan", 0.05555555555555555], ["night", 0.05555555555555555], ["slaughterhouse", 0.05555555555555555], ["god", 0.05555555555555555], ["dick", 0.05555555555555555], ["pagos", 0.05555555555555555], ["bless", 0.05555555555555555], ["player", 0.05555555555555555], ["sunday", 0.05555555555555555], ["gal", 0.05555555555555555], ["palm", 0.05555555555555555], ["mother", 0.05555555555555555], ["deadeye", 0.05555555555555555], ["slapstick", 0.05555555555555555], ["piano", 0.05555555555555555]], "sentiment": ["Deadeye Dick\nGal\u00e1pagos\nGod Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\nJailbird\nMother Night\nPalm Sunday\nPlayer Piano\nThe Sirens of Titan\nSlapstick\nSlaughterhouse-Five", 0.0], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "god-bless-you-dr-kevorkian": {"tfidf": [["love", 0.05405405405405406], ["won", 0.05405405405405406], ["human", 0.02702702702702703], ["september", 0.02702702702702703], ["mind", 0.02702702702702703], ["dead", 0.02702702702702703], ["books", 0.02702702702702703], ["questions", 0.02702702702702703], ["neil", 0.02702702702702703], ["um", 0.02702702702702703], ["matter", 0.02702702702702703], ["introduction", 0.02702702702702703], ["writing", 0.02702702702702703], ["quote", 0.02702702702702703], ["2010", 0.02702702702702703], ["listen", 0.02702702702702703], ["book", 0.02702702702702703], ["life", 0.02702702702702703], ["prefer", 0.02702702702702703], ["mow", 0.02702702702702703], ["controlling", 0.02702702702702703], ["purpose", 0.02702702702702703], ["smiled", 0.02702702702702703], ["wanted", 0.02702702702702703], ["loved", 0.02702702702702703], ["kind", 0.02702702702702703], ["gaiman", 0.02702702702702703], ["face", 0.02702702702702703], ["looked", 0.02702702702702703], ["conversation", 0.02702702702702703], ["honestly", 0.02702702702702703], ["grass", 0.02702702702702703], ["expression", 0.02702702702702703], ["asked", 0.02702702702702703], ["talk", 0.02702702702702703]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI\u2019m writing the introduction and wanted to ask you some questions.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019d prefer not to,\u201d he said.

["left", 0.002785515320334262]], "sentiment": ["Vonnegut wrote that \u201cA writer is first and foremost a teacher,\u201d and his talks to graduates always taught the lesson that underlies all his work, a lesson, bluntly uttered by a character in one of his early novels, that he passed on to fans who sought his advice: \u201cThere\u2019s only one rule I know of\u2014Goddam it, you\u2019ve got to be kind.\u201d Coming from a long line of German Freethinkers, Vonnegut was not a Christian, though he spoke of Jesus as \u201cthe greatest and most humane of human beings.\u201d In a talk he gave to St. Clement Episcopal Church in New York City (\u201cPalm Sunday\u201d), he said: \u201cI am enchanted by the Sermon on the Mount. Being merciful, it seems to me, is the only good idea we have had so far. Perhaps we will get another good idea by and by\u2014and then we will have two good ideas.\u201d\nHe served as honorary chairman of the American Humanist Society, and explained in one of his talks that \u201cWe Humanists behave as honorably as we can without any expectations of rewards or punishments in the afterlife. We serve as best we can the only abstraction with which we have any familiarity, which is our community.\u201d\nVonnegut was a staunch believer in serving one\u2019s community, wherever or whatever it might be. Although some graduating classes will have a \u201chandful of celebrities\u201d who move on to the national stage, he pointed out that most would find themselves \u201cbuilding or strengthening your communities. Please love that destiny, if it turns out to be yours\u2014for communities are all that\u2019s substantial about the world. The rest is hoop-la. And for your footloose generation, that community could as easily be New York City or Washington, Paris or Houston\u2014or Adelaide, Australia. Or Shanghai or Kuala Lumpur.\u201d\nOr it might be the city or town where you were born and grew up. Vonnegut and I were both born and grew up in Indianapolis, but left to go off to college and live far away from there. Once while we were walking down the street in New York, Vonnegut turned to me and said, \u201cYou know, Dan, we never had to leave home to be writers, because there are people there just as smart and just as dumb, just as kind and just as mean, as anywhere else in the world.\u201d He was proud of the education he received at Shortridge High School, where he had worked on our school paper, The Daily Echo, as I did a decade later. When asked once by an interviewer \u201cWhere did you get your radical ideas?\u201d he answered proudly and without hesitation, \u201cThe public schools of Indianapolis.\u201d\nVonnegut took part in the communities he lived in, serving in the Volunteer Fire Department of Alplaus, New York, where he lived while working for General Electric in Schenectady. When he lived in Barnstable, on Cape Cod, Kurt and his wife Jane conducted a Great Books course for the community. (A Phi Beta Kappa from Swarthmore, Jane had him read The Brothers Karamazov on their honeymoon.) When he moved to New York City, he became deeply involved in the PEN Club, serving as vice president and fighting for the rights of writers around the world.\nIf your destiny was not to live and work in a big city or a foreign land, it was just as important and admirable, in Vonnegut\u2019s view, to serve the place where you found yourself and felt yourself fulfilled, no matter how small or obscure that place might seem to the rest of the world. When his friend Jerome Klinkowitz, a teacher and literary critic, asked his advice about moving from a small town in Iowa to a more prestigious position on the East Coast, Vonnegut wrote him \u201cI am certain you are highly valued and badly needed right where you are. That must be a nourishing situation. If you move East, you may find that life becomes a lot less personal.\u201d Klinkowitz heeded his advice to stay where he was, and told me years later, \u201cIt was the best advice I ever got.\u201d\nIn his talks, as in his books and stories and essays, Vonnegut conveys what he feels is the message many people \u201cneed desperately to receive\u201d:\n\u201cI feel and think much as you do, care about many of the things you care about, although most people don\u2019t care about them. You are not alone.\u201d\nWhile most of the talks here are to graduating classes, one is to the Indiana Civil Liberties Union, and another is an acceptance of the Carl Sandburg Literary Award; what he has to say in both is as relevant to young people as his words to the graduates. They convey the message that he sent to the chairman of the Drake School Board of Drake, North Dakota, who had not only banned his novel Slaughterhouse-Five, but for good measure, had burned copies of it in the high school furnace:\n\u201c\u2026if you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hard-working men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don\u2019t damage children much. They didn\u2019t damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.\u201d", 0.18360372224830057], "title": "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["crafted", 0.04], ["armageddon", 0.04], ["breakfast", 0.04], ["witty", 0.04], ["bluebeard", 0.04], ["better", 0.04], ["superbly", 0.04], ["vonnegut", 0.04], ["bagombo", 0.04], ["tragic", 0.04], ["insightful", 0.04], ["retrospect", 0.04], ["snuff", 0.04], ["sacramento", 0.04], ["champions", 0.04], ["man", 0.04], ["box", 0.04], ["upi", 0.04], ["country", 0.04], ["bee", 0.04], ["timbuktu", 0.04], ["race", 0.04], ["time", 0.04], ["kurt", 0.04], ["appraisal", 0.04]], "sentiment": ["\u2014The Sacramento Bee\n\u201cA superbly crafted, insightful, witty yet tragic appraisal of where we are as a race and where we might be better off.\u201d\n\u2014UPI\nBY KURT VONNEGUT\nA Man Without a Country\nArmageddon in Retrospect\nBagombo Snuff Box\nBetween Time and Timbuktu\nBluebeard\nBreakfast of Champions", 0.3125], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["sirens", 0.05], ["jailbird", 0.05], ["rosewater", 0.05], ["titan", 0.05], ["night", 0.05], ["deadeye", 0.05], ["god", 0.05], ["gal", 0.05], ["dick", 0.05], ["cat", 0.05], ["bless", 0.05], ["player", 0.05], ["sunday", 0.05], ["cradle", 0.05], ["palm", 0.05], ["mother", 0.05], ["breakfast", 0.05], ["pagos", 0.05], ["champions", 0.05], ["piano", 0.05]], "sentiment": ["Breakfast of Champions\nCat\u2019s Cradle\nDeadeye Dick\nGal\u00e1pagos\nGod Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\nJailbird\nMother Night\nPalm Sunday\nPlayer Piano\nThe Sirens of Titan", 0.0], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "a-man-without-a-country": {"tfidf": [["vonnegut", 0.07317073170731707], ["kurt", 0.07317073170731707], ["vic", 0.024390243902439025], ["627", 0.024390243902439025], ["yarra", 0.024390243902439025], ["century", 0.024390243902439025], ["58322", 0.024390243902439025], ["library", 0.024390243902439025], ["macmillan", 0.024390243902439025], ["states", 0.024390243902439025], ["3141", 0.024390243902439025], ["street", 0.024390243902439025], ["1st", 0.024390243902439025], ["politics", 0.024390243902439025], ["biography", 0.024390243902439025], ["cm", 0.024390243902439025], ["simon", 0.024390243902439025], ["publication", 0.024390243902439025], ["790", 0.024390243902439025], ["eisbn", 0.024390243902439025], ["cataloging", 0.024390243902439025], ["978", 0.024390243902439025], ["daniel", 0.024390243902439025], ["chapel", 0.024390243902439025], ["edited", 0.024390243902439025], ["congress", 0.024390243902439025], ["government", 0.024390243902439025], ["united", 0.024390243902439025], ["authors", 0.024390243902439025], ["data", 0.024390243902439025], ["man", 0.024390243902439025], ["country", 0.024390243902439025], ["american", 0.024390243902439025], ["2001", 0.024390243902439025], ["20th", 0.024390243902439025], ["palgrave", 0.024390243902439025], ["south", 0.024390243902439025]], "sentiment": ["Palgrave Macmillan, 627 Chapel Street, South Yarra VIC 3141\nLibrary of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data\nVonnegut, Kurt.\nA man without a country / Kurt Vonnegut;\nedited by Daniel Simon\u20141st ed.\np. cm.\neISBN: 978-1-58322-790-9\n1.

We lost a very reasonable and credible\u2014though not to say staid or toothless\u2014voice who helped us know how to live.\nWith the internet, god bless it, we are absolutely overrun with commentary and opinions. Can\u2019t tell just yet, but so far, this seems fine. The access for everyone\u2014commentators and their audiences\u2014is more democratically available, and this is surely good. We have a million or so people offering daily advice, insight, perspective, and the occasional attempt to help us live in better harmony with our planet and our fellow humans. On the other hand, to get attention on the internet (and on television, for that matter), a commentator, more often than not, has to be loud, radical, or insane. And so the vast majority of such commentary is all three.\nThen we have our novelists and short-story writers. By comparison, these people seem sane and well mannered. The catch is, they are, by and large, very quiet. They toil in the woods or on campuses or in Brooklyn, and they are so polite that they would never tell anyone, let alone their readers, how to live. And so the majority of contemporary literature, though it truly is brilliant and wonderful in myriad ways, is also free of moral instruction.\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that literature must tell us how to live, or must offer clear moral directives. No. No. I\u2019m not saying that, internet commentators. But I am saying that it\u2019s okay for some contemporary literature to do so. In a pluralistic literary environment\u2014and we need such a thing, we need to maintain it, to nourish it so that dozens of styles and genres can coexist free of the misguided notion that there is one miraculous form that obviates all others\u2014in such an environment, couldn\u2019t there be a few writers who come out and say, \u201cThis is bad, that is good?\u201d", 0.16183094683094684], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["hardy", 0.05555555555555555], ["slapstick", 0.05555555555555555], ["dedicated", 0.027777777777777776], ["love", 0.027777777777777776], ["timequake", 0.027777777777777776], ["house", 0.027777777777777776], ["baptiz", 0.027777777777777776], ["laurel", 0.027777777777777776], ["stanley", 0.027777777777777776], ["comedies", 0.027777777777777776], ["film", 0.027777777777777776], ["autobiography", 0.027777777777777776], ["granfalloons", 0.027777777777777776], ["monkey", 0.027777777777777776], ["grotesque", 0.027777777777777776], ["poetry", 0.027777777777777776], ["long", 0.027777777777777776], ["writing", 0.027777777777777776], ["jefferson", 0.027777777777777776], ["call", 0.027777777777777776], ["time", 0.027777777777777776], ["situational", 0.027777777777777776], ["angels", 0.027777777777777776], ["memory", 0.027777777777777776], ["closest", 0.027777777777777776], ["foma", 0.027777777777777776], ["wampeters", 0.027777777777777776], ["romeo", 0.027777777777777776], ["norvell", 0.027777777777777776], ["ago", 0.027777777777777776], ["will", 0.027777777777777776], ["arthur", 0.027777777777777776], ["prologue", 0.027777777777777776], ["called", 0.027777777777777776]], "sentiment": ["Timequake\nWampeters, Foma & Granfalloons\nWelcome to the Monkey House\nDedicated to the memory of\nArthur Stanley Jefferson and Norvell Hardy,\ntwo angels of my time.\n\u201cCall me but love, and I\u2019ll be new baptiz\u2019d \u2026\u201d\n\u2014ROMEO\nPROLOGUE\nTHIS IS THE CLOSEST I will ever come to writing an autobiography.

OF MONEY is a leading character in this tale about people, just as a sum of honey might properly be a leading character in a tale about bees.\nThe sum was $87,472,033.61 on June 1, 1964, to pick a day. That was the day it caught the soft eyes of a boy shyster named Norman Mushari. The income the interesting sum produced was $3,500,000 a year, nearly $10,000 a day\u2014Sundays, too.\nThe sum was made the core of a charitable and cultural foundation in 1947, when Norman Mushari was only six. Before that, it was the fourteenth largest family fortune in America, the Rosewater fortune. It was stashed into a foundation in order that tax-collectors and other predators not named Rosewater might be prevented from getting their hands on it. And the baroque masterpiece of legal folderol that was the charter of the Rosewater Foundation declared, in effect, that the presidency of the Foundation was to be inherited in the same manner as the British Crown. It was to be handed down throughout all eternity to the closest and oldest heirs of the Foundation's creator, Senator Lister Ames Rosewater of Indiana.\nSiblings of the President were to become officers of the Foundation upon reaching the age of twenty-one. All officers were officers for life, unless proved legally insane. They were free to compensate themselves for their services as lavishly as they pleased, but only from the Foundation's income.\nAs required by law, the charter prohibited the Senator's heirs having anything to do with the management of the Foundation's capital. Caring for the capital became the responsibility of a corporation that was born simultaneously with the Foundation. It was called, straightforwardly enough, The Rosewater Corporation. Like almost all corporations, it was dedicated to prudence and profit, to balance sheets. Its employees were very well paid. They were cunning and happy and energetic on that account. Their main enterprise was the churning of stocks and bonds of other corporations. A minor activity was the management of a saw factory, a bowling alley, a motel, a bank, a brewery, extensive farms in Rosewater County, Indiana, and some coal mines in northern Kentucky.\nThe Rosewater Corporation occupied two floors at 500 Fifth Avenue, in New York, and maintained small branch offices in London, Tokyo, Buenos Aires and Rosewater County. No member of the Rosewater Foundation could tell the Corporation what to do with the capital. Conversely, the Corporation was powerless to tell the Foundation what to do with the copious profits the Corporation made.\nThese facts became known to young Norman Mushari when, upon graduating from Cornell Law School at the top of his class, he went to work for the Washington, D.C., law firm that had designed both the Foundation and the Corporation, the firm of McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee. He was of Lebanese extraction, the son of a Brooklyn rug merchant. He was five feet and three inches tall. He had an enormous ass, which was luminous when bare.\nHe was the youngest, the shortest, and by all odds the least Anglo-Saxon male employee in the firm. He was put to work under the most senile partner, Thurmond McAllister, a sweet old poop who was seventy-six. He would never have been hired if the other partners hadn't felt that McAllister's operations could do with just a touch more viciousness.", 0.059705788039121375], "title": "God Bless You, Mr.

come up here, so we couldn\u2019t get much done until tomorrow morning anyway.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that, sitting on a hard bench, waiting for clearance,\u201d said Peter wearily. Instantly he realized that he had said something wrong again. Borgorov\u2019s black eyebrows were raised, and Josef was glaring. He had absentmindedly violated one of Josef\u2019s basic maxims\u2014\u201cNever complain in public about anything.\u201d Peter sighed. On the battlefield he had proved a thousand times that he was a fiercely patriotic Russian. Yet, he now found his countrymen eager to read into his every word and gesture the symptoms of treason. He looked at Josef unhappily, and saw in his eyes the same old message: Grin and agree with everything.\n\u201cThe security measures are marvelous,\u201d said Peter, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that they were able to clear us in only three days, when you realize how thorough a job they do.\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cEfficiency.\u201d\n\u201cHow far down did you find the fossils?\u201d said Josef briskly, changing the subject.\nBorgorov\u2019s eyebrows were still arched. Plainly, Peter had only succeeded in making himself even more suspicious. \u201cWe hit them going through the lower part of the limestone, before we came to the sandstone and granite,\u201d he said flatly, addressing himself to Josef.\n\u201cMiddle Mesozoic period, probably,\u201d said Josef. \u201cWe were hoping you\u2019d found fossil ants deeper than that.\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong. We\u2019re delighted that you found these ants, it\u2019s only that middle Mesozoic ants aren\u2019t as interesting as something earlier would be.\u201d\n\u201cNobody\u2019s ever seen a fossil ant from an earlier period,\u201d said Peter, trying halfheartedly to get back into things. Borgorov ignored him.\n\u201cMesozoic ants are just about indistinguishable from modern ants,\u201d said Josef, surreptitiously signaling for Peter to keep his mouth shut. \u201cThey lived in big colonies, were specialized as soldiers and workers and all that. My myrmecologist would give his right arm to know how ants lived before they formed colonies\u2014how they got to be the way they are now. That would be something.\u201d\n\u201cAnother first for Russia,\u201d said Peter. Again no response. He stared moodily at a pair of live ants who pulled tirelessly and in opposite directions at the legs of an expiring dung beetle.\n\u201cHave you seen the ants we found?\u201d said Borgorov defensively. He waved a small tin box under Josef\u2019s nose. He popped off the lid with his thumbnail. \u201cIs this old stuff, eh?\u201d", 0.06544196544196544], "title": "Petrified Ants"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["fights", 0.034482758620689655], ["agent", 0.034482758620689655], ["protein", 0.034482758620689655], ["cut", 0.034482758620689655], ["glass", 0.034482758620689655], ["zinka", 0.034482758620689655], ["illustrious", 0.034482758620689655], ["charge", 0.034482758620689655], ["secret", 0.034482758620689655], ["christmas", 0.034482758620689655], ["delight", 0.034482758620689655], ["automobiles", 0.034482758620689655], ["jumping", 0.034482758620689655], ["merry", 0.034482758620689655], ["vases", 0.034482758620689655], ["president", 0.034482758620689655], ["bug", 0.034482758620689655], ["newt", 0.034482758620689655], ["14", 0.034482758620689655], ["11", 0.034482758620689655], ["10", 0.034482758620689655], ["13", 0.034482758620689655], ["12", 0.034482758620689655], ["15", 0.034482758620689655], ["hoenikkers", 0.034482758620689655], ["vice", 0.034482758620689655], ["volcanoes", 0.034482758620689655], ["thing", 0.034482758620689655], ["place", 0.034482758620689655]], "sentiment": ["6 BUG FIGHTS\n7 THE ILLUSTRIOUS HOENIKKERS\n8 NEWT\u2019S THING WITH ZINKA\n9 VICE-PRESIDENT IN CHARGE OF VOLCANOES\n10 SECRET AGENT X-9\n11 PROTEIN\n12 END OF THE WORLD DELIGHT\n13 THE JUMPING-OFF PLACE\n14 WHEN AUTOMOBILES HAD CUT-GLASS VASES\n15 MERRY CHRISTMAS", -0.4], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "twobrzerotwob": {"tfidf": [["orderly", 0.060240963855421686], ["number", 0.03614457831325301], ["painter", 0.03614457831325301], ["people", 0.024096385542168676], ["idea", 0.024096385542168676], ["hospital", 0.024096385542168676], ["picture", 0.024096385542168676], ["telephone", 0.024096385542168676], ["hitz", 0.024096385542168676], ["life", 0.024096385542168676], ["figures", 0.024096385542168676], ["faces", 0.024096385542168676], ["meant", 0.012048192771084338], ["0", 0.012048192771084338], ["office", 0.012048192771084338], ["staff", 0.012048192771084338], ["portraits", 0.012048192771084338], ["frame", 0.012048192771084338], ["duck", 0.012048192771084338], ["mural", 0.012048192771084338], ["daub", 0.012048192771084338], ["good", 0.012048192771084338], ["sight", 0.012048192771084338], ["blank", 0.012048192771084338], ["portrait", 0.012048192771084338], ["honest", 0.012048192771084338], ["fill", 0.012048192771084338], ["trick", 0.012048192771084338], ["shrugged", 0.012048192771084338], ["referring", 0.012048192771084338], ["chicago", 0.012048192771084338], ["federal", 0.012048192771084338], ["pictures", 0.012048192771084338], ["blindingly", 0.012048192771084338], ["chief", 0.012048192771084338], ["crime", 0.012048192771084338], ["dropcloth", 0.012048192771084338], ["live", 0.012048192771084338], ["bureau", 0.012048192771084338], ["lot", 0.012048192771084338], ["scorn", 0.012048192771084338], ["damn", 0.012048192771084338], ["white", 0.012048192771084338], ["handsome", 0.012048192771084338], ["filled", 0.012048192771084338], ["nice", 0.012048192771084338], ["benjamin", 0.012048192771084338], ["head", 0.012048192771084338], ["blanks", 0.012048192771084338], ["gestured", 0.012048192771084338], ["finished", 0.012048192771084338], ["gloomy", 0.012048192771084338], ["grandpa", 0.012048192771084338], ["foul", 0.012048192771084338], ["naught", 0.012048192771084338], ["dr", 0.012048192771084338], ["man", 0.012048192771084338], ["male", 0.012048192771084338], ["curdled", 0.012048192771084338], ["face", 0.012048192771084338], ["thought", 0.012048192771084338], ["pronounced", 0.012048192771084338], ["supposed", 0.012048192771084338], ["termination", 0.012048192771084338], ["obstetrician", 0.012048192771084338], ["call", 0.012048192771084338]], "sentiment": ["He was referring to one of the male figures in white, whose head was a portrait of Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospital's Chief Obstetrician.

At this point in history, 1952 A.D., our lives and freedom depend largely upon the skill and imagination and courage of our managers and engineers, and I hope that God will help them to help us all stay alive and free.\nBut this book is about another point in history, when there is no more war, and \u2026\n1\nILIUM, NEW YORK, is divided into three parts.\nIn the northwest are the managers and engineers and civil servants and a few professional people; in the northeast are the machines; and in the south, across the Iroquois River, is the area known locally as Homestead, where almost all of the people live.\nIf the bridge across the Iroquois were dynamited, few daily routines would be disturbed. Not many people on either side have reasons other than curiosity for crossing.\nDuring the war, in hundreds of Iliums over America, managers and engineers learned to get along without their men and women, who went to fight. It was the miracle that won the war\u2014production with almost no manpower. In the patois of the north side of the river, it was the know-how that won the war. Democracy owed its life to know-how.\nTen years after the war\u2014after the men and women had come home, after the riots had been put down, after thousands had been jailed under the antisabotage laws\u2014Doctor Paul Proteus was petting a cat in his office. He was the most important, brilliant person in Ilium, the manager of the Ilium Works, though only thirty-five. He was tall, thin, nervous, and dark, with the gentle good looks of his long face distorted by dark-rimmed glasses.\nHe didn\u2019t feel important or brilliant at the moment, nor had he for some time.

students during his years on the faculty of the University of Iowa\u2019s graduate writing program, as well as Columbia and Harvard, he told me, \u201cDevelopment. Every scene, every dialogue should advance the narrative and then if possible there should be a surprise ending.\u201d The element of surprise serves, too, to express the paradox of Kurt\u2019s viewpoint. When all is said and written, the resolution, the surprise, turns the story around and gives it meaning.\nUnpublished is not a word we identify with a Kurt Vonnegut short story. It may well be that these stories didn\u2019t appear in print because for one reason or another they didn\u2019t satisfy Kurt. He rewrote and rewrote, as his son, Mark, as well as agents and editors testify. Although Kurt\u2019s style may seem casual and spontaneous, he was a master craftsman, demanding of himself perfection of the story, the sentence, the word. I remember the rolled up balls of paper in the wastebaskets of his workrooms in Bridgehampton and on East Forty-eighth Street.\nThe closest Kurt ever came to confessing an ambition for his writing was when he recited to me one of his rules for fictional composition: \u201cUse the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.\u201d\nTo Kurt Vonnegut writing was kind of a spiritual mission, and these stories with all their humor seem most often to be inspired by his moral and political outrage. They are evidence, too, of the volume of Kurt\u2019s prodigious imagination, a talent that enabled him, after World War II and into the fifties and early sixties, to help support his growing family by contributing short stories to the popular (\u201cslick\u201d) magazines.\nKurt Vonnegut, Jr.\u2019s bylines appeared routinely in The Saturday Evening Post, Collier\u2019s, Cosmopolitan, Argosy. He later reminded his readers of the satisfactions of this association when he wrote in his introduction to Bagombo Snuff Box, \u201cI was in such good company\u2026. Hemingway had written for Esquire, F. Scott Fitzgerald for The Saturday Evening Post, William Faulkner for Collier\u2019s, John Steinbeck for The Woman\u2019s Home Companion!\u201d\nHemingway! Fitzgerald! Faulkner! Steinbeck! Vonnegut! Their literary legacies survived the demise of so many of the magazines that provided them with generous fees, per word or per line, and introduced them to hundreds of thousands, even millions of readers.\nKurt\u2019s stories selected for this collection are reminiscent of the entertainments of that era\u2014so easy to read, so straightforward as to seem simplistic in narrative technique, until the reader thinks about what the author is saying. They are Kurt\u2019s magic verbal lantern, the Confido that projects so relentlessly the vagaries and mysteries of human behavior, but with a leavening of humor and forgiveness.\nThe discovery of this sampling of vintage Vonnegut confirms the accessibility that is the trademark of his style and the durability of his talents, a gift to all of us\u2014friends and readers who celebrate the enlightenments and fun of Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s jujitsus and his art.\nCONTENTS\nForeword by Sidney Offit", 0.1836111111111111], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["chapter", 0.06060606060606061], ["vonnegut", 0.045454545454545456], ["satire", 0.030303030303030304], ["heart", 0.015151515151515152], ["finest", 0.015151515151515152], ["milwaukee", 0.015151515151515152], ["classic", 0.015151515151515152], ["absorbing", 0.015151515151515152], ["house", 0.015151515151515152], ["prods", 0.015151515151515152], ["marvelous", 0.015151515151515152], ["pokes", 0.015151515151515152], ["tribune", 0.015151515151515152], ["denver", 0.015151515151515152], ["fable", 0.015151515151515152], ["savage", 0.015151515151515152], ["comic", 0.015151515151515152], ["best", 0.015151515151515152], ["sympathetic", 0.015151515151515152], ["funny", 0.015151515151515152], ["heller", 0.015151515151515152], ["hocus", 0.015151515151515152], ["eye", 0.015151515151515152], ["scathing", 0.015151515151515152], ["chicago", 0.015151515151515152], ["bite", 0.015151515151515152], ["philadelphia", 0.015151515151515152], ["40", 0.015151515151515152], ["joseph", 0.015151515151515152], ["wonderfully", 0.015151515151515152], ["inquirer", 0.015151515151515152], ["pocus", 0.015151515151515152], ["exercise", 0.015151515151515152], ["achievements", 0.015151515151515152], ["literature", 0.015151515151515152], ["press", 0.015151515151515152], ["90s", 0.015151515151515152], ["pittsburgh", 0.015151515151515152], ["great", 0.015151515151515152], ["journal", 0.015151515151515152], ["hits", 0.015151515151515152], ["drew", 0.015151515151515152], ["dark", 0.015151515151515152], ["enters", 0.015151515151515152], ["bull", 0.015151515151515152], ["society", 0.015151515151515152], ["news", 0.015151515151515152], ["post", 0.015151515151515152], ["39", 0.015151515151515152], ["38", 0.015151515151515152], ["target", 0.015151515151515152], ["created", 0.015151515151515152], ["career", 0.015151515151515152], ["37", 0.015151515151515152], ["triumphant", 0.015151515151515152], ["spirited", 0.015151515151515152], ["time", 0.015151515151515152], ["cards", 0.015151515151515152], ["book", 0.015151515151515152], ["triumph", 0.015151515151515152]], "sentiment": ["Chapter 37\nChapter 38\nChapter 39\nChapter 40\n\u201cA classic.\u201d\u2014Chicago Tribune\n\u201cComic, absorbing ... one of the finest achievements of his career.\u201d\u2014Philadelphia Inquirer\n\u201cA triumph.

Otherwise, they might never have seen the light of day again. I myself hadn\u2019t saved one scrap of paper from that part of my life. I didn\u2019t think I would amount to a hill of beans. All I wanted to do was support a family.\nPeter\u2019s quest was that of a scholar. I nevertheless asked him to go an extra mile for me, by providing an informal preface to what is in fact his rather than my collection.\nGod bless you, Dr. Reed, I think.\nThese stories, and twenty-three of similar quality in my previous hardcover collection, Welcome to the Monkey House, were written at the very end of a golden age of magazine fiction in this country. For about fifty years, until 1953, say, stories like these were a mild but popular form of entertainment in millions of homes, my own included.\nThis old man\u2019s hope has to be that some of his earliest tales, for all their mildness and innocence and clumsiness, may, in these coarse times, still entertain.\nThey would not be reprinted now, if novels I had written around the same time had not, better late than never, received critical attention. My children were adults by then, and I was middle-aged.

She taught us to be impolite in conversation not only about sexual matters, but about American history and famous heroes, about the distribution of wealth, about school, about everything.\nI now make my living by being impolite. I am clumsy at it. I keep trying to imitate the impoliteness which was so graceful in Phoebe Hurty. I think now that grace was easier for her than it is for me because of the mood of the Great Depression.
