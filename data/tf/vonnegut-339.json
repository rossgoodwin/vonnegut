And how moving on occasion. I choked up when, in a letter a few months ago, you said in effect that you would gladly give up Freethinking if you could only see your son again.\nAs you know, I have spent and finally wasted the past three years in trying to construct a novel around a Freethinker. Many problems with story-telling are purely mechanical, which most people don\u2019t realize. Working on a story is a lot like working on a Model-T. The son of a bitch has stopped. How can I get it to go again? In order to continue to make a living, I have given up on the Freethinker theme. As becomes more obvious every day, good citizenship is highly unpopular.\nYou speak of cheap paper, so I have a surprise for you. I have been part of a movement here to get publishers to print books on acid-free paper, so that they will last for three hundred years instead of thirty. We thought that this would make books cost even more, and that publishers would have to eat this cost for the good of civilization. It turns out that acid-free paper costs not one bit more, and that it was simply absent-mindedness, laziness and ignorance which caused publishers to accept what the paper manufacturers, for reasons unclear, were glad to stick them with. Paper was paper. Because of this period of thoughtlessness about paper, the New York Public Library now has thirty-two miles of books consuming themselves. It also has books printed in Europe three-hundred years ago which look as though they had come off the presses yesterday.\nTo refresh your memory: I sent copies of the Freethinker tract reprint to The New York Public Library, to the Library of Congress, to Jack Mendelson, who will surely take good care of it and show it to others, to the Episcopal Bishop of New York, Paul Moore, who is about to retire and who spent many years in Indianapolis, and to the University of Northern Iowa, in Cedar Falls. A relatively young professor there named Jerome Klinkowitz has collected a lot of my work there, and I thought he should have the tract, too, and the family tree.\nWhat Mayor Hudnut says between the lines is that Freethinking does not satisfy because it is too lonely. Most people can\u2019t stand that much loneliness. I just barely can.\nLove as always\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut\nMarch 28, 1989\nNew York City", 0.23499297999298008], "title": "Letters"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["writing", 0.021739130434782608],

should have repaired before they were printed the first time. Rereading three of them so upset me, because the premise and the characters of each were so promising, and the denouement so asinine, that I virtually rewrote the denouement before I could stop myself. Some \u201cediting\u201d! They are \u201cThe Powder-Blue Dragon,\u201d \u201cThe Boy Who Hated Girls,\u201d and \u201cHal Irwin\u2019s Magic Lamp.\u201d As fossils, they are fakes on the order of Piltdown Man, half human being, half the orangutan I used to be.\nNo matter how clumsily I wrote when I was starting out, there were magazines that would publish such orangutans. And there were others that, to their credit, would not touch my stuff with rubber gloves. I wasn\u2019t offended or ashamed. I understood. I was nothing if not modest. I remember a cartoon I saw long ago, in which a psychiatrist was saying to a patient, \u201cYou don\u2019t have an inferiority complex. You are inferior.\u201d If the patient could afford a psychiatrist, he was earning a living somehow, despite his genuine inferiority. That was my case, too, and the evidence seems to be that I got better.\nThanks to popular magazines, I learned on the job to be a fiction writer. Such paid literary apprenticeships, with standards of performance so low, don\u2019t exist anymore. Mine was an opportunity to get to know myself. Those who wrote for self-consciously literary publications had this advantage, their talent and sophistication aside: They already knew what they could do and who they were.\nThere may be more Americans than ever now embarking on voyages of self-discovery like mine, by writing stories, come hell or high water, as well as they can. I lecture at eight colleges and universities each year, and have been doing so for two decades. Half of those one hundred sixty institutions have a writer-in-residence and a course in creative writing. When I quit General Electric to become a writer, there were only two such courses, one at the University of Iowa, the other at Stanford, which my President\u2019s daughter now attends.\nGiven that it is no longer possible to make a living writing short stories, and that the odds against a novel\u2019s being successful are a thousand to one, creative-writing courses could be perceived as frauds, as would pharmacy courses if there were no drugstores. Be that as it may, students themselves demanded creative writing courses while they were demanding so many other things, passionately and chaotically, during the Vietnam War.\nWhat students wanted and got, and what so many of their children are getting, was a cheap way to externalize what was inside them, to see in black-and-white who they were and what they might become. I italicize cheap because it takes a ton of money to make a movie or a TV show. Never mind that you have to deal with the scum of the earth if you try to make one.\nThere are on many campuses, moreover, local papers, weeklies or monthlies, that publish short stories but cannot pay for them. What the heck, practicing an art isn\u2019t a way to earn money. It\u2019s a way to make one\u2019s soul grow.\nBon voyage.\nI still write for periodicals from time to time, but never fiction, and only when somebody asks me to. I am not the dynamic self-starter I used to be. An excellent alternative weekly in Indianapolis, NUVO, asked me only a month ago to write an essay for no pay on the subject of what it is like to be a native Middle Westerner. I have replied as follows:\n\u201cBreathes there the man, with soul so dead, who never to himself has said, this is my own, my native land!\u201d", 0.11709119496855344], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"},

apartment. The other rooms were the bathroom, the living room, and the wide, windowless hallway, which was originally intended to serve as a dining area, and which had a kitchenette in one end. Six mattresses and four sleeping bags were dispersed in the hallway and living room, and the daybed, in the living room, accommodated the eleventh couple, the favorites of the moment.\nOn Gramps\u2019 bureau was his will, smeared, dog-eared, perforated, and blotched with hundreds of additions, deletions, accusations, conditions, warnings, advice, and homely philosophy. The document was, Lou reflected, a fifty-year diary, all jammed onto two sheets\u2014a garbled, illegible log of day after day of strife. This day, Lou would be disinherited for the eleventh time, and it would take him perhaps six months of impeccable behavior to regain the promise of a share in the estate.\n\"Boy!\" called Gramps.\n\"Coming, sir.\" Lou hurried back into the living room, and handed Gramps the will.\n\"Pen!\" said Gramps.\nHe was instantly offered eleven pens, one from each couple.\n\"Not that leaky thing,\" he said, brushing Lou\u2019s pen aside. \"Ah, there\u2019s a nice one. Good boy, Willy.\" He accepted Willy\u2019s pen. That was the tip they\u2019d all been waiting for. Willy, then, Lou\u2019s father, was the new favorite.\nWilly, who looked almost as young as Lou, though one hundred and forty-two, did a poor job of concealing his pleasure. He glanced shyly at the daybed, which would become his, and from which Lou and Emerald would have to move back into the hall, back to the worst spot of all by the bathroom door.\nGramps missed none of the high drama he\u2019d authored, and he gave his own familiar role everything he had. Frowning and running his finger along each line, as though he were seeing the will for the first time, he read aloud in a deep, portentous monotone, like a bass tone on a cathedral organ:\n\"I, Harold D. Schwartz, residing in Building 257 of Alden Village, New York City, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my last Will and Testament, hereby revoking any and all former wills and codicils by me at any time heretofore made.\" He blew his nose importantly, and went on, not missing a word, and repeating many for emphasis\u2014repeating in particular his ever-more-elaborate specifications for a funeral.", 0.1251980744949495], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
