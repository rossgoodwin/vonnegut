admire.\u201d\nReconstructing what he said to us long ago, I am touched by how careful he and almost all angry males used to be, when in mixed company, not to use words which might offend women and children, such as shit and fuck.\nCirce Berman argues that the inclusion of once-taboo words into ordinary conversations is a good thing, since women and children are now free to discuss their bodies without shame, and so to take care of themselves more intelligently.\nI said to her, \u201cMaybe so.

We had our pictures taken with them, too.\nYes, and they announced from the stage that they were honored that night to have in the audience \u201cthe famous writer Kurt Vonnegut and his wife, Jill Krementz, the famous photographer.\u201d We got a terrific hand, although we did not stand up and identify ourselves, and although nobody, I\u2019m sure, had ever heard of us before.\nA woman came up to us afterward, and she said that we must be the famous people the brothers had mentioned, since we didn\u2019t look like anybody else in the auditorium. She said that from now on she was going to read everything we wrote.\nJill and I stayed in the same Holiday Inn as the Statler Brothers, but they slept all afternoon. Their bus was parked outside where we could see it from our room. Right after their performance, around midnight, they got on the bus, and it started up with that fruity, burbling, soft purple rumble that bus engines have. The bus left without any lights showing inside. Nobody waved from a window. It headed for Columbus, Ohio, for another performance the next night.

These creeps sure don't.\nNorman Mushari killed the afternoon by driving over to Newport, paid a quarter to tour the famous Rumfoord Mansion. The queer thing about the tour was that the Rumfoords were still living there, and glaring at all comers. Moreover, they didn't need the money, God knows.\nMushari was sufficiently offended by the way that Lance Rumfoord, who was six feet eight inches tall, sneered whinnyingly at him, that he complained about it to a family servant who was guiding the tour. \"If they hate the public so much,\" said Mushari, \"they shouldn't invite them in and take their money.\"\nThis failed to gain the sympathy of the servant, who explained with acrid fatalism that the estate was open to the public for only one day out of every five years. This was required by a will now three generations old.\n\"Why would a will say that?\"\n\"It was the feeling of the founder of this estate that it would be in the best interests of those living within these walls to periodically take a sampling of the sorts of people who were appearing at random outside of them.\" He looked Mushari up and down. \"You might call it keeping up with current events. You know?\"\nAs Mushari was leaving the estate, Lance Rumfoord came loping after him. Predatorily genial, he towered over little Mushari, explained that his mother considered herself a great judge of character, and had made the guess that Mushari had once served in the United States Infantry.\n\"No.\"", 0.06591435185185184], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["sarah", 0.06896551724137931], ["remember", 0.034482758620689655], ["wyatt", 0.034482758620689655], ["managed", 0.017241379310344827], ["athletic", 0.017241379310344827], ["parties", 0.017241379310344827], ["talking", 0.017241379310344827], ["woman", 0.017241379310344827], ["kathleen", 0.017241379310344827], ["year", 0.017241379310344827], ["mentioned", 0.017241379310344827], ["sexual", 0.017241379310344827], ["guess", 0.017241379310344827], ["uproar", 0.017241379310344827], ["remains", 0.017241379310344827], ["slept", 0.017241379310344827], ["foxy", 0.017241379310344827], ["needed", 0.017241379310344827], ["finally", 0.017241379310344827], ["wonderful", 0.017241379310344827], ["lot", 0.017241379310344827], ["timing", 0.017241379310344827], ["women", 0.017241379310344827], ["intelligent", 0.017241379310344827], ["events", 0.017241379310344827], ["shapeless", 0.017241379310344827], ["metropolis", 0.017241379310344827], ["good", 0.017241379310344827], ["shopping", 0.017241379310344827], ["coquettish", 0.017241379310344827], ["maiden", 0.017241379310344827], ["woozy", 0.017241379310344827], ["food", 0.017241379310344827], ["offered", 0.017241379310344827], ["clewes", 0.017241379310344827], ["harvard", 0.017241379310344827], ["cook", 0.017241379310344827], ["lady", 0.017241379310344827], ["longer", 0.017241379310344827], ["loved", 0.017241379310344827], ["looney", 0.017241379310344827], ["virginal", 0.017241379310344827], ["misgivings", 0.017241379310344827], ["experience", 0.017241379310344827], ["mary", 0.017241379310344827], ["bag", 0.017241379310344827], ["mature", 0.017241379310344827], ["time", 0.017241379310344827], ["squiring", 0.017241379310344827], ["senior", 0.017241379310344827], ["concerts", 0.017241379310344827], ["silence", 0.017241379310344827], ["proof", 0.017241379310344827]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThat\u2019s intelligent,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll say this though:\u201d he said, \u201cThe food is good.

Civilians and soldiers alike, and even little children, were proud to have played a part in it. It was impossible, seemingly, for any sort of person not to feel a part of that war, if he or she was alive while it was going on. Yes, and the suffering or death of soldiers and sailors and Marines was felt at least a little bit by everyone.\nBut the Vietnam War belongs exclusively to those of us who fought in it. Nobody else had anything to do with it, supposedly. Everybody else is as pure as the driven snow. We alone are stupid and dirty, having fought such a war. When we lost, it served us right for ever having started it. The night I went temporarily insane in a Chinese restaurant on Harvard Square, everybody was a big success but me.\nBEFORE I BLEW up, Mildred\u2019s old friend from Peru, Indiana, spoke as though we were in separate businesses, as though I were a podiatrist, maybe, or a sheet-metal contractor, instead of somebody who had risked his life and sacrificed common sense and decency on his behalf.\nAs it happened, he himself was in the medical-waste disposa game in Indianapolis. That\u2019s a nice business to learn about in a Chinese restaurant, with everybody dangling who knows what from chopsticks.\nHe said that his workaday problems had as much to do with aesthetics as with toxicity. Those were both his words, \u201caesthetics\u201d and \u201ctoxicity.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cNobody likes to find a foot or a finger or whatever in a garbage can or a dump, even though it is no more dangerous to public health than the remains of a rib roast.\u201d\nHe asked me if I saw anything on his and his wife\u2019s table that I would like to sample, that they had ordered too much.\n\u201cNo, thank you, sir,\u201d I said.\n\u201cBut telling you that,\u201d he said, \u201cis coals to Newcastle.\u201d\n\u201cHow so?\u201d I said.

Durant, florid and irritated with himself, was trying to manage a cast of thousands spread over the forty thousand square miles of South Korea. His audience was listening with glazed eyes, brightening at any sign that the parts were about to be brought together into a whole and thence to an end. But the signs were always false, and at last, when Marion swallowed her third yawn, Durant blew himself in his story through the wall of his tent and fell silent.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Teddy, \u201cit\u2019s hard for us who haven\u2019t seen it to imagine.\u201d\n\u201cWords can hardly convey it,\u201d said Marion.

Here\u2019s one of his dogtags, sir. I left the other one with the body. Sorry, sir, I meant to turn this in before now.\u201d\nThe major studied the tag, finally fastened it to the affidavit, and slipped both into a thick folder. I could see George\u2019s name written on the outside. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what to do with this next,\u201d he said, toying with the tie-string on the folder. \u201cQuite a guy, George Fisher.\u201d He offered me a cigarette. I took it, but I didn\u2019t light it right away.\nThis was it. God knows how, but they\u2019d found out the whole story, I thought. I wanted to yell, but I kept on smiling, my teeth clamped together hard.\nThe major took his time about phrasing the next sentence. \u201cThe tag is a phony,\u201d he said at last, smiling a little. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody by that name missing from the U.S. Army.\u201d He leaned forward to light my cigarette. \u201cMaybe we\u2019d better turn this folder over to the Germans so they can notify the next of kin.\u201d\nI\u2019d never seen George Fisher before they brought him into prison camp alone that day eight months previous, but I should have known the type. I grew up with a couple of kids like him. He must have been a good Nazi to get his job in German Intelligence, because as I said, most of the Bund kids didn\u2019t do that well. I don\u2019t know how many of them got back to the U.S. when the war ended, but my buddy George Fisher damn near made it.\nThe Commandant\u2019s Desk\nI was sitting before the window of my small cabinetmaking shop in the Czechoslovakian town of Beda. My widowed daughter, Marta, held the curtain back for me, and watched the Americans through one corner of the window, being careful not to block any of my view with her head.\n\u201cI wish he would turn this way, so we could see his face,\u201d I said impatiently. \u201cMarta, pull the curtain back more.\u201d\n\u201cIs he a general?\u201d said Marta.\n\u201cA general as commandant for Beda?\u201d I laughed. \u201cA corporal, maybe. How well fed they all look, eh? Aaaaaah, they eat\u2014how they eat!\u201d I ran my hand along the back of my black cat. \u201cNow, kitty, you have only to cross the street for your first taste of American cream.\u201d I raised my hands over my head. \u201cMarta! Do you feel it, do you feel it? The Russians are gone, Marta, they\u2019re gone!\u201d", 0.06183035714285715], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
