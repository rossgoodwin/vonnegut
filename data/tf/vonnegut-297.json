[\u2026] You guys are the only friends I have. I am beginning to wonder if my arm will quit hurting and get strong again, the way the sports medicine doctor said it would. You went through the same thing, did you? [\u2026]\nI was the person, incidentally, who asked Salinger to sign Catcher in the Rye, and who was refused most angrily. Did you ever tell Kunes that? I used Salinger\u2019s neighbor, the Centurian Frank Platt, to sign the book for its wonderful Russian translator, Rita Rait. Salinger not only refused. He stopped speaking to Platt.\nI must have told you during our ping-pong days so long ago: Truman Capote said that Salinger has been submitting stories regularly to the New Yorker, and that the stories, which Capote claims to have read, are awful. I asked Updike if he believed this, and Updike said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were true\u2014that Salinger was certainly trending toward incomprehensibility. Updike exclaimed over the early stories, saying they were \u201cso juicy!\u201d This was a way of suggesting, I think, that Salinger didn\u2019t have much of an intellect. Finally, I guess, you can\u2019t make a career of simply looking.
