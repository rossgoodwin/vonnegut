No one spoke or smiled or looked at anyone else.\nPaul considered the notion of Doctor Gelhorne\u2019s being the last of a race, and decided it was true. He had got to the top through a disorderly route that the personnel machines would never tolerate. Had machines been watching things when Gelhorne started his climb to the top, his classification card would have come flying out of the card files like an old Wheaties box top.\nHe had no college degree of any kind, other than bouquets of honorary doctorates that had come to him in his late fifties and sixties.\nHe\u2019d had nothing to do with industry, in fact, until he was thirty. Before that, he\u2019d pulled a mail-order taxidermy business out of bankruptcy, sold his interest in it, and bought a trailer truck. He\u2019d built his fleet to five trucks when he received a hot market tip, sold his business, invested the proceeds, and tripled his wealth. With this bonanza, he\u2019d bought the largest, yet failing, ice-cream plant in Indianapolis, and put the business in the black inside of a year by building ice-cream routes servicing Indianapolis manufacturing plants during the lunch hour. In another year, he had his trucks carrying sandwiches and coffee along with ice cream. In another year, he was running plant cafeterias all over town, and the ice-cream business had become a minor division of Gelhorne Enterprises.\nHe\u2019d found that many of the manufacturing firms were owned by third-or fourth-generation heirs who, by some seeming law of decay, didn\u2019t have the nerve or interest the plants\u2019 founders had had. Gelhorne, half playfully at first, had offered these heirs advice, and found them amazingly eager to surrender responsibility. He\u2019d bought in, watched and learned, and, discovering nerve was as valuable as special knowledge, he\u2019d become manager and part owner of a dozen small plants.\nWhen war became certain and the largest corporations were looking about for new manufacturing facilities, Gelhorne had delivered his prosperous community of plants to General Steel, and become an officer of that corporation. The rule-of-thumb familiarity he had with many different industries, as represented by the plants he\u2019d taken over, had been broader than that of any executives General Steel had developed within its own organization, and Gelhorne was soon spending all his time at the side of the corporation\u2019s war-rattled president.\nThere he\u2019d come to the attention of Paul\u2019s father in Washington, and Paul\u2019s father had made Gelhorne his general executive manager when the whole economy had been made one flesh. When Paul\u2019s father died, Gelhorne had taken over.\nIt could never happen again. The machines would never stand for it.\nPaul remembered a week end long ago, when he had been a tall, skinny, polite, and easily embarrassed youth, and Gelhorne had paid a call. Gelhorne had suddenly reached out and caught Paul by the arm as Paul passed his chair. \u201cPaul, boy.\u201d\n\u201cYessir?\u201d", 0.1978997564935065], "title": "Player Piano"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["family", 0.038461538461538464], ["paper", 0.038461538461538464], ["dilling", 0.038461538461538464], ["girls", 0.028846153846153848], ["big", 0.028846153846153848], ["boys", 0.028846153846153848], ["things", 0.028846153846153848], ["thinking", 0.019230769230769232], ["young", 0.019230769230769232], ["twins", 0.019230769230769232], ["salary", 0.019230769230769232], ["men", 0.019230769230769232], ["security", 0.019230769230769232], ["experience", 0.019230769230769232], ["david", 0.019230769230769232], ["man", 0.019230769230769232], ["starting", 0.009615384615384616], ["eh", 0.009615384615384616], ["people", 0.009615384615384616], ["feel", 0.009615384615384616], ["flatter", 0.009615384615384616], ["move", 0.009615384615384616], ["winked", 0.009615384615384616], ["sales", 0.009615384615384616], ["years", 0.009615384615384616], ["depends", 0.009615384615384616], ["expect", 0.009615384615384616], ["promotion", 0.009615384615384616], ["village", 0.009615384615384616], ["balanced", 0.009615384615384616], ["pleasantry", 0.009615384615384616], ["cigarette", 0.009615384615384616], ["interesting", 0.009615384615384616], ["twenty", 0.009615384615384616], ["writing", 0.009615384615384616], ["better", 0.009615384615384616], ["start", 0.009615384615384616], ["lovely", 0.009615384615384616], ["administrative", 0.009615384615384616], ["war", 0.009615384615384616], ["opens", 0.009615384615384616], ["nice", 0.009615384615384616], ["jobs", 0.009615384615384616], ["casually", 0.009615384615384616], ["shortages", 0.009615384615384616], ["exactly", 0.009615384615384616], ["possibility", 0.009615384615384616], ["idea", 0.009615384615384616], ["running", 0.009615384615384616], ["land", 0.009615384615384616], ["lighting", 0.009615384615384616], ["plan", 0.009615384615384616], ["smiled", 0.009615384615384616], ["bit", 0.009615384615384616], ["wanted", 0.009615384615384616], ["concentrating", 0.009615384615384616], ["glad", 0.009615384615384616], ["pleasantly", 0.009615384615384616], ["ago", 0.009615384615384616], ["pay", 0.009615384615384616], ["remark", 0.009615384615384616], ["openings", 0.009615384615384616], ["wise", 0.009615384615384616], ["philosophically", 0.009615384615384616], ["wife", 0.009615384615384616], ["country", 0.009615384615384616], ["worth", 0.009615384615384616], ["days", 0.009615384615384616], ["good", 0.009615384615384616], ["responsibility", 0.009615384615384616], ["advertising", 0.009615384615384616], ["happened", 0.009615384615384616], ["understand", 0.009615384615384616], ["stale", 0.009615384615384616], ["bought", 0.009615384615384616], ["treated", 0.009615384615384616], ["industry", 0.009615384615384616], ["lay", 0.009615384615384616]], "sentiment": ["\"Oh\u2014you don\u2019t say.

He had, after all, solved his problem of the night before neatly\u2014by trading paintings with Lazarro. He no longer feared humiliation. He had signed his name to a painting with soul. Glory was probably awaiting him in the strange stillness outside.\nWhat made Stedman not want to get up was a feeling that he had lost something priceless in the lunatic night.\nAs he shaved and examined himself in the mirror, he knew that the priceless thing he had lost wasn\u2019t integrity. He was still the same old genial humbug. Nor had he lost cash. He and Lazarro had traded even-Steven.\nThere was no one in his studio as he passed through it from his trailer to the front. It was too early for tourists to be coming through. They wouldn\u2019t appear until noon. Nor did Cornelia seem to be around.\nThe feeling that he had lost something important was now so strong that Stedman gave in to a compulsion to rummage through drawers and cabinets in the studio for only-God-knew-what.
