Mark Vonnegut explains that \u201cI called Jane \u2018Aunt Jane\u2019 so as not to call attention to \u2018the orphans\u2019 [the Adams boys] not having a living mother or mom, which I didn\u2019t stop until I was thirty. I called Kurt mostly \u2018Dad,\u2019 as I believe my sisters did as well. Most of Barnstable referred to Jane as \u2018Aunt Jane.\u2019 Kurt was \u2018Unky K\u2019 or \u2018K\u2019 to the orphans. \u2018Aunt Mother\u2019 and \u2018Uncle Father\u2019 must have been in jest or sarcasm.\u2026\u201d\nDearest Nanny:\nI have sent you a very stupid birthday present today by air mail, and I hope it gets there in time. Just because it is stupid and didn\u2019t cost much doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you. I hope you understand that. Because I am so far away (and so very lonesome), I have to let Aunt Mother get you something really good. Please tell me what the really good thing was.\nI did you a big favor. I fixed things so that Aunt Mother and Edith can\u2019t get mad at you because you got something from me and they didn\u2019t. I sent presents to them, too. But their presents didn\u2019t cost half as much as yours did.\nI am getting a lot of good work done here, which is why I came here. I write a lot, and teach a lot. The students say they like me, and they have gone out and bought books I have written, and they say they like those, too. Most of my students have already graduated from college, but they keep on going to college anyway. I guess they are comfortable in college. Tell Aunt Mother that they are practically all men, older than Jim, and that the few girls are very nervous and unattractive, the way girls get if they go to college too long.\nTell Aunt Mother, too, that I signed and mailed the Harper\u2019s contract today, and that Uncle Max will be coming to see her soon with the money.\nI want you and Aunt Mother and Edith to come out here and live with me after Christmas vacation, or whenever your first semester ends. We couldn\u2019t fit into this terrible little place I have now, but I am starting to look for something better. You will like this pretty little town. It is fun to walk around, and there are lots of movie houses and good stores, and practically everybody is either a kid or a teacher. There is also a beautiful indoor swimming pool, a huge one, that costs only a dime.\nLove from your Uncle Father,\nK", 0.13228935698447894], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["woman", 0.02097902097902098], ["frankenstein", 0.02097902097902098], ["prometheus", 0.02097902097902098], ["pandora", 0.02097902097902098], ["scientist", 0.013986013986013986], ["human", 0.013986013986013986], ["worked", 0.013986013986013986], ["monster", 0.013986013986013986], ["article", 0.013986013986013986], ["kids", 0.013986013986013986], ["family", 0.013986013986013986], ["man", 0.013986013986013986], ["town", 0.013986013986013986], ["making", 0.013986013986013986], ["person", 0.013986013986013986], ["proposed", 0.006993006993006993], ["flesh", 0.006993006993006993], ["gods", 0.006993006993006993], ["meetings", 0.006993006993006993], ["held", 0.006993006993006993], ["style", 0.006993006993006993], ["death", 0.006993006993006993], ["responsibilities", 0.006993006993006993], ["send", 0.006993006993006993], ["technological", 0.006993006993006993], ["diseases", 0.006993006993006993], ["kills", 0.006993006993006993], ["big", 0.006993006993006993], ["survival", 0.006993006993006993], ["celebrate", 0.006993006993006993], ["course", 0.006993006993006993], ["turns", 0.006993006993006993], ["brother", 0.006993006993006993], ["53", 0.006993006993006993], ["frantically", 0.006993006993006993], ["hasten", 0.006993006993006993], ["elements", 0.006993006993006993], ["essential", 0.006993006993006993], ["bernie", 0.006993006993006993], ["declared", 0.006993006993006993], ["schemes", 0.006993006993006993], ["begged", 0.006993006993006993], ["scared", 0.006993006993006993], ["idea", 0.006993006993006993], ["alive", 0.006993006993006993], ["economic", 0.006993006993006993], ["expect", 0.006993006993006993], ["stealing", 0.006993006993006993], ["best", 0.006993006993006993], ["universities", 0.006993006993006993], ["provided", 0.006993006993006993], ["constitution", 0.006993006993006993], ["solemn", 0.006993006993006993], ["chaos", 0.006993006993006993], ["mud", 0.006993006993006993], ["public", 0.006993006993006993], ["knowing", 0.006993006993006993], ["turning", 0.006993006993006993], ["sorely", 0.006993006993006993], ["reaching", 0.006993006993006993], ["loose", 0.006993006993006993], ["humiliating", 0.006993006993006993], ["revenge", 0.006993006993006993], ["smartest", 0.006993006993006993], ["evil", 0.006993006993006993], ["attendant", 0.006993006993006993], ["chapter", 0.006993006993006993], ["ritual", 0.006993006993006993], ["statutory", 0.006993006993006993], ["finds", 0.006993006993006993], ["blind", 0.006993006993006993], ["wilder", 0.006993006993006993], ["feel", 0.006993006993006993], ["community", 0.006993006993006993], ["americans", 0.006993006993006993], ["open", 0.006993006993006993], ["angry", 0.006993006993006993], ["political", 0.006993006993006993], ["dignities", 0.006993006993006993], ["war", 0.006993006993006993], ["purposely", 0.006993006993006993], ["sort", 0.006993006993006993], ["box", 0.006993006993006993], ["life", 0.006993006993006993], ["families", 0.006993006993006993], ["puberty", 0.006993006993006993], ["fire", 0.006993006993006993], ["xxx", 0.006993006993006993], ["heir", 0.006993006993006993], ["extended", 0.006993006993006993], ["adult", 0.006993006993006993], ["midst", 0.006993006993006993], ["ibos", 0.006993006993006993], ["effort", 0.006993006993006993], ["spirit", 0.006993006993006993], ["unpopular", 0.006993006993006993], ["rights", 0.006993006993006993], ["bill", 0.006993006993006993], ["devices", 0.006993006993006993], ["will", 0.006993006993006993], ["ugly", 0.006993006993006993], ["debated", 0.006993006993006993], ["values", 0.006993006993006993], ["mythology", 0.006993006993006993], ["modern", 0.006993006993006993], ["poisons", 0.006993006993006993], ["talking", 0.006993006993006993], ["shit", 0.006993006993006993], ["opened", 0.006993006993006993], ["amendments", 0.006993006993006993], ["greek", 0.006993006993006993], ["thornton", 0.006993006993006993], ["45", 0.006993006993006993], ["ideal", 0.006993006993006993], ["xxxi", 0.006993006993006993], ["indianapolis", 0.006993006993006993], ["diet", 0.006993006993006993], ["convincingly", 0.006993006993006993], ["ecological", 0.006993006993006993], ["characters", 0.006993006993006993], ["ethics", 0.006993006993006993], ["destructive", 0.006993006993006993], ["missed", 0.006993006993006993], ["age", 0.006993006993006993]], "sentiment": ["They must have held many meetings, in which ethics as well as survival schemes were debated.\nAnd they still send their smartest kids off to the best universities far away.\nWhen I celebrate the idea of a family and family values, I don\u2019t mean a man and a woman and their kids, new in town, scared to death, and not knowing whether to shit or go blind in the midst of economic and technological and ecological and political chaos. I\u2019m talking about what so many Americans need so frantically: what I had in Indianapolis before World War Two, and what the characters in Thornton Wilder\u2019s Our Town had, and what the Ibos have.\nIn chapter 45, I proposed two amendments to the Constitution. Here are two more, little enough to expect from life, one would think, like the Bill of Rights:\nArticle XXX: Every person, upon reaching a statutory age of puberty, shall be declared an adult in a solemn public ritual, during which he or she must welcome his or her new responsibilities in the community, and their attendant dignities.\nArticle XXXI: Every effort shall be made to make every person feel that he or she will be sorely missed when he or she is gone.\nSuch essential elements in an ideal diet for a human spirit, of course, can be provided convincingly only by extended families.\n53\nThe monster in Frankenstein\u2014or, The Modern Prometheus turns mean because he finds it so humiliating to be alive and yet so ugly, so unpopular. He kills Frankenstein, who, again, is the scientist and not the monster. And let me hasten to say that my big brother Bernie never has been a Frankenstein-style scientist, never has worked nor would have worked on purposely destructive devices of any sort. He hasn\u2019t been a Pandora, either, turning loose new poisons or new diseases or whatever.\nAccording to Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman.

It had worked hard at the syrup factory, and then it had marched a long way home in the cold. It was skinny and hollow-eyed. Its skins were beginning to blossom with small sores. So were its mouths and throats and intestines. The malt syrup it spooned at the factory contained only a few of the vitamins and minerals every Earthling needs.\nCampbell offered the Americans food now, steaks and mashed potatoes and gravy and mince pie, if they would join the Free American Corps. \u201cOnce the Russians are defeated,\u201d he went on, \u201cyou will be repatriated through Switzerland.\u201d\nThere was no response.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to fight the Communists sooner or later,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cWhy not get it over with now?\u201d\nAnd then it developed that Campbell was not going to go unanswered after all. Poor old Derby, the doomed high school teacher, lumbered to his feet for what was probably the finest moment in his life. There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters. But old Derby was a character now.\nHis stance was that of a punch-drunk fighter. His head was down. His fists were out front, waiting for information and battle plan. Derby raised his head, called Campbell a snake. He corrected that. He said that snakes couldn\u2019t help being snakes, and that Campbell, who could help being what he was, was something much lower than a snake or a rat\u2014or even a blood-filled tick.\nCampbell smiled.\nDerby spoke movingly of the American form of government, with freedom and justice and opportunities and fair play for all. He said there wasn\u2019t a man there who wouldn\u2019t gladly die for those ideals.\nHe spoke of the brotherhood between the American and the Russian people, and how those two nations were going to

They spent most of their time playing German batball.\nThe game of German batball is played with a flabby ball the size of a big honeydew melon. The ball is no more lively than a ten-gallon hat filled with rain water. The game is something like baseball, with a batter striking the ball into a field of opposing players and running around bases; and with the fielders attempting to catch the ball and frustrate the runner. There are, however, only three bases in German batball-first, second, and home. And the batter is not pitched to. He places the ball on one fist and strikes the ball with his other first. And if a fielder succeeds in striking the runner with the ball when the runner is between bases, the runner is deemed out, and must leave the playing field at once.\nThe person responsible for the heavy emphasis on German batball on Mars was, of course, Winston Niles Rumfoord, who was responsible for everything on Mars.\nHoward W. Sams proves in his Winston Niles Rumfoord, Benjamin Franklin, and Leonardo da Vinci that German batball was the only team sport with which Rumfoord was at all familiar as a child. Sams shows that Rumfoord was taught the game, when a child, by his governess, a Miss Joyce MacKenzie.\nBack in Rumfoord\u2019s childhood in Newport, a team composed of Rumfoord, Miss MacKenzie, and Earl Moncrief the butler, used to play German batball regularly against a team composed of Watanabe Wataru the Japanese gardener, Beverly June Wataru the gardener\u2019s daughter, and Edward Seward Darlington the half-wit stable boy. Rumfoord\u2019s team invariably won.\nUnk, the only deserter in the history of the Army of Mars, now crouched panting behind a turquoise boulder and watched the school children playing German batball on the iron playground. Behind the boulder with Unk was a bicycle he had stolen from a gas-mask factory\u2019s bicycle rack. Unk did not know which child was his son, which child was Chrono.\nUnk\u2019s plans were nebulous. His dream was to gather together his wife, his son, and his best friend, to steal a space ship, and to fly away to some place where they could all live happily ever after.\n\"Hey, Chrono!\" cried a child on the playground. \"You\u2019re up to bat!\"\nUnk peered around the boulder at home plate. The child who came up to bat there would be Chrono, would be his son.", 0.09817159692159691], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["siegfried", 0.041666666666666664], ["captain", 0.027777777777777776], ["de", 0.027777777777777776], ["ghost", 0.027777777777777776], ["shouted", 0.027777777777777776], ["brother", 0.027777777777777776], ["thought", 0.027777777777777776], ["control", 0.013888888888888888], ["bends", 0.013888888888888888], ["figure", 0.013888888888888888], ["deck", 0.013888888888888888], ["caused", 0.013888888888888888], ["deep", 0.013888888888888888], ["36", 0.013888888888888888], ["feet", 0.013888888888888888], ["heard", 0.013888888888888888], ["shout", 0.013888888888888888], ["rising", 0.013888888888888888], ["human", 0.013888888888888888], ["cruise", 0.013888888888888888], ["huntington", 0.013888888888888888], ["find", 0.013888888888888888], ["movements", 0.013888888888888888], ["la", 0.013888888888888888], ["sun", 0.013888888888888888], ["century", 0.013888888888888888], ["recognize", 0.013888888888888888], ["chaos", 0.013888888888888888], ["moon", 0.013888888888888888], ["chorea", 0.013888888888888888], ["1695", 0.013888888888888888], ["peaceful", 0.013888888888888888], ["stories", 0.013888888888888888], ["darwin", 0.013888888888888888], ["whispered", 0.013888888888888888], ["jacks", 0.013888888888888888], ["fontaine", 0.013888888888888888], ["nature", 0.013888888888888888], ["involuntary", 0.013888888888888888], ["bus", 0.013888888888888888], ["ship", 0.013888888888888888], ["hoped", 0.013888888888888888], ["push", 0.013888888888888888], ["jumping", 0.013888888888888888], ["haunted", 0.013888888888888888], ["leon", 0.013888888888888888], ["coming", 0.013888888888888888], ["exercises", 0.013888888888888888], ["knee", 0.013888888888888888], ["shadow", 0.013888888888888888], ["beholding", 0.013888888888888888], ["believed", 0.013888888888888888], ["1621", 0.013888888888888888], ["couldn", 0.013888888888888888], ["materialized", 0.013888888888888888], ["dancing", 0.013888888888888888], ["recognized", 0.013888888888888888], ["face", 0.013888888888888888], ["place", 0.013888888888888888], ["stopping", 0.013888888888888888], ["jean", 0.013888888888888888], ["trout", 0.013888888888888888], ["tempted", 0.013888888888888888], ["bah", 0.013888888888888888]], "sentiment": ["\u2014JEAN DE LA FONTAINE\n(1621\u20131695)\nThe most *Siegfried hoped to find was a peaceful stopping place in chaos.

I was through being host. I sank back down in my chair by the window. Captain Donnini, ill at ease, stayed with Marta and me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very beautiful here in the mountains,\u201d he said lamely.\nWe lapsed into an uncomfortable silence, broken from time to time by the major\u2019s rummaging about in the back room. I took a good look at the captain, and was struck by how much more boyish he seemed than the major, though it was quite possible that they were the same age. It was hard to imagine him on a battlefield, and it was hard to imagine the major anywhere else.\nI heard Major Evans give a low whistle, and I knew he\u2019d found the commandant\u2019s desk.\n\u201cThe major must have been a very brave man, he has so many medals,\u201d said Marta at last.\nCaptain Donnini seemed grateful for a chance to explain about his superior. \u201cHe was and is an extremely brave man,\u201d he said warmly. He said that the major and most of the enlisted men in Beda had come from an apparently famous armored division, which, the captain implied, never knew fear or fatigue, and loved nothing better than a good fight.\nI clucked my tongue in wonderment, as I always do when hearing of such a division. I have heard of them from American officers, German officers, Russian officers; and my officers in World War I solemnly declared that I belonged to such a division. When I hear of a division of war-lovers from an enlisted man, maybe I will believe it, provided the man is sober and has been shot at. If there are such divisions, perhaps they should be preserved between wars in dry ice.\n\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d said Marta, breaking into the captain\u2019s blood-and-thunder biography of Major Evans.\nHe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m so new to Europe, I can\u2019t\u2014if you\u2019ll pardon the expression\u2014find my behind with both hands. The air of Fort Benning, Georgia, is still in my lungs.
