I have played the game about a thousand times, and it works like a dollar watch. The bugs are out of the rules.\nIt is similar in mood to chess, and is played on a standard checkerboard. It has enough dignity and interest, I think, to become the third popular checkerboard game.\nThe counters represent artillery, infantry, armored, and airborne units, and textbook tactical situations develop on the board. Because of unique features of these rules, these situations and their solutions are amazingly realistic. The game would, I\u2019m quite sure, satisfy the faculty of West Point as a tactical demonstrator.\nThe counters are pretty as they can be. Plenty of sales appeal there\u2014particularly for veterans itching to show how much they know about tactics.\nA nine-year-old can learn it. All the neighborhood kids can play it and love to play it.\nI am hoping, of course, to interest you and your company in producing and marketing the game. If, on the basis of the enclosed set of rules, you are at all interested in seeing more, I will, upon hearing from you, send you a pilot-model set of the colorful playing pieces. Patent is now being applied for, so you would be adequately protected if you were to take it on.\nVery truly yours,\nKurt Vonnegut, Jr.\nOctober 26, 1957\nWest Barnstable, MA", 0.10357142857142856],

girls\u2019 manners and clothes. She was a Phi Beta Kappa from Swarthmore, and had been the outstanding writer there!\nI thought maybe I could be some kind of half-assed scientist, since that had been my education.\n26\nIn the third edition of The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772- 1834) speaks of \u201cthat willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith.\u201d This acceptance of balderdash is essential to the enjoyment of poems, and of novels and short stories, and of dramas, too. Some assertions by writers, however, are simply too preposterous to be believed.\nWho, for example, could believe Kilgore Trout when he wrote as follows in My Ten Years on Automatic Pilot: \u201cThere is a planet in the Solar System where the people are so stupid they didn\u2019t catch on for a million years that there was another half to their planet. They didn\u2019t figure that out until five hundred years ago! Only five hundred years ago! And yet they are now calling themselves Homo sapiens.\n\u201cDumb? You want to talk dumb?

He had a daughter he didn\u2019t even know he had, not that she could have made any difference, telling him how much she loved him, begging him not to do it and so on, that sort of thing. She was only three years old then. And she wouldn\u2019t find out her biological father was a long-dead Boston orthodontist until, at the age of twenty-five, she tracked down her still unmarried biological mother, Mary Kathleen McCarthy, who worked as a receptionist for a veterinarian in Fresno, California, and who told her about him. So there was no biological father to whom she might introduce herself with all possible modesty. She did find out, at least, whence came her red hair. Mary Kathleen McCarthy\u2019s hair was brown. The name of the daughter, who was put up for adoption at the age of three months, was Kimberley Berlin.\nHere\u2019s the story: Mary Kathleen McCarthy, an orphan, a Roman Catholic, had worked as a receptionist for Bob Berman in Boston for three years. She knew he was married and was devoted to his wife, although she did nothing but play the piano and make scrapbooks of items in the Boston Globe, and made no sense when she was talking, and they had a son who was at the top of his class in high school. But she could not help herself: She fell in love with him. He was indeed lovable, \u201ca paragon of manly schmaltz,\u201d as his son would call him: good looking and sexy, but overwhelmingly considerate, and sentimental about the human race in general, quick to reward, forgive or comfort, or boost a loser\u2019s self-esteem. He was a people person if there ever was one.\nEven after Gil Berman\u2019s dad fucked Mary Kathleen McCarthy on her desk after hours, in a moment of passion, her passion, with the telephone ringing and ringing, and knocked her up when she was twenty-four, she was still able to say to the redheaded Kimberley Berlin in Fresno: \u201cYour father was a people person if there ever was one. He never took his eye off the sparrow. If you couldn\u2019t get along with Dr. Berman, you couldn\u2019t get along with anyone. And he could be so funny. Laugh, I thought I\u2019d die.\u201d\nAnd Mary Kathleen was surely not the first woman in history to find a man so lovable that she would have died for him, if that would help. More common, and more in practical harmony with the apparent intentions of evolution, one would think, have been women who died for children, children as children, not necessarily their own. The sacrifice Mary Kathleen performed for Bob Berman was a near-death experience for her, since she would never see him again. But it required only that she not tell him she was carrying his child, and that she quit her job and head for the other seacoast, where she would have that child and put her up for adoption.\nWhen Gil Berman said celibacy was like not lighting a cigarette, he had no idea that this might have some bearing on his father\u2019s life. But it might be said that it was Mary Kathleen\u2019s match that lit the cigarette of Dr. Berman. And she knew that. She took full blame for what became Kimberley Berlin. She made the time-honored blunder of deciding a man should know how much he was loved, even though they both knew there was nothing either one of them could do about it: sort of like in an opera. What such women seldom realize, if they\u2019ve never done it before, is that such an operatic confession in real life will cause their own bodies and souls to insist on copulation. She confessed, then cried. He put his arms around her and said, \u201cThere, there,\u201d and off they went to the races.\nGil Berman was asked by a psychiatric social-worker during his first stay at Caldwell why, in his opinion, his father killed himself, although his father was in good physical health and was only forty-two. His father left no note, unless fastening his seatbelt first was some sort of note. He had given no indication to his hostess that, as soon as she was asleep, he was going to kill himself. And Berman said this: \u201cI dunno. Don\u2019t ask. I hardly knew him. He came home to Knightsbridge less and less, and I don\u2019t blame him. When he did come home, he had to look at Mother\u2019s latest scrapbooks and say how much he liked them. And then she would play and play the piano, and I would sit on the bench next to her, so he would have to yell if he had anything to say to me.\n\u201cThe fault was mine, not his. I\u2019m afraid I treated him as an invader, an intruder. I told him I hated golf, and my teeth were coming in nice and straight. I was very close to my mother because I was so sorry for her. Now see the corner you\u2019ve backed me into? What do I say next? That my father killed himself because his own son could not like him? Thanks a bunch. This much I know: I never heard him mention the Holocaust.\u201d\nYes, and on the CD Who\u2019s Sorry Now? Berman posits this conundrum: \u201cWho\u2019s kidding whom? We\u2019re having a War on Drugs? The biggest American industry in dollar volume, number of employees, and persons and even nations directly or indirectly affected by it, is the thwarting or bankrolling, manufacture, shipping, and sales, wholesale and retail, of mind-bending, mood-enhancing, or blackout chemicals, including alcohol. Half the banks and brokerages in California and Florida would go bust if it weren\u2019t for invested profits from the drug trade. But don\u2019t worry: The War on Drugs might as well be a war on glaciers, with the soldiers armed with ice picks and smoking joints.\u201d\nAnd then he intoned: \u201cLet us pray: \u2018Our Father which art in heaven, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Amen.\u2019\u201d\nAnd then he called the President of the United States \u201ca corksocker.\u201d", 0.1451665548848647], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf":

"sentiment": ["Now he was indoors, next to an iron cookstove that was glowing cherry red. Dozens of teapots were boiling there. Some of them had whistles. And there was a witches\u2019 cauldron full of golden soup. The soup was thick. Primeval bubbles surfaced it with lethargical majesty as Billy Pilgrim stared.\nThere were long tables set for a banquet. At each place was a bowl made from a can that had once contained powdered milk. A smaller can was a cup. A taller, more slender can was a tumbler. Each tumbler was filled with warm milk.\nAt each place was a safety razor, a washcloth, a package of razor blades, a chocolate bar, two cigars, a bar of soap, ten cigarettes, a book of matches, a pencil, and a candle.\nOnly the candles and the soap were of German origin. They had a ghostly, opalescent similarity. The British had no way of knowing it, but the candles and the soap were made from the fat of rendered Jews and Gypsies and fairies and communists, and other enemies of the State.\nSo it goes.\nThe banquet hall was illuminated by candlelight. There were heaps of fresh-baked white bread on the tables, gobs of butter, pots of marmalade. There were platters of sliced beef from cans. Soup and scrambled eggs and hot marmalade pie were yet to come.\nAnd, at the far end of the shed, Billy saw pink arches with azure draperies hanging between them, and an enormous clock, and two golden thrones, and a bucket and a mop. It was in this setting that the evening\u2019s entertainment would take place, a musical version of Cinderella, the most popular story ever told.\nBilly Pilgrim was on fire, having stood too close to the glowing stove. The hem of his little coat was burning. It was a quiet, patient sort of fire\u2014like the burning of punk.\nBilly wondered if there was a telephone somewhere. He wanted to call his mother, to tell her he was alive and well.\nThere was silence now, as the Englishmen looked in astonishment at the frowsy creatures they had so lustily waltzed inside. One of the Englishmen saw that Billy was on fire. \u201cYou\u2019re on fire, lad!\u201d he said, and he got Billy away from the stove and beat out the sparks with his hands.", 0.11990740740740741], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["malachi", 0.06993006993006994], ["young", 0.04895104895104895], ["noel", 0.04195804195804196], ["gomburg", 0.03496503496503497], ["room", 0.027972027972027972], ["opus", 0.02097902097902098], ["photograph", 0.02097902097902098], ["constant", 0.02097902097902098], ["magnum", 0.02097902097902098], ["discovered", 0.013986013986013986], ["son", 0.013986013986013986], ["reading", 0.013986013986013986], ["attention", 0.013986013986013986], ["book", 0.013986013986013986], ["love", 0.013986013986013986], ["fern", 0.013986013986013986], ["secret", 0.013986013986013986], ["223", 0.013986013986013986], ["furnishings", 0.013986013986013986], ["ransom", 0.013986013986013986], ["detail", 0.013986013986013986], ["picture", 0.013986013986013986], ["birthday", 0.013986013986013986], ["increasingly", 0.006993006993006993], ["money", 0.006993006993006993], ["human", 0.006993006993006993], ["father", 0.006993006993006993], ["thumbtacked", 0.006993006993006993], ["wall", 0.006993006993006993], ["interested", 0.006993006993006993], ["good", 0.006993006993006993], ["game", 0.006993006993006993], ["sons", 0.006993006993006993], ["minded", 0.006993006993006993], ["party", 0.006993006993006993], ["chronological", 0.006993006993006993], ["inabilities", 0.006993006993006993], ["list", 0.006993006993006993], ["thesis", 0.006993006993006993], ["fathers", 0.006993006993006993], ["hard", 0.006993006993006993], ["unloved", 0.006993006993006993], ["rate", 0.006993006993006993], ["incidentally", 0.006993006993006993], ["investment", 0.006993006993006993], ["ransacked", 0.006993006993006993], ["emotions", 0.006993006993006993], ["laid", 0.006993006993006993], ["unable", 0.006993006993006993], ["method", 0.006993006993006993], ["told", 0.006993006993006993], ["business", 0.006993006993006993], ["wilburhampton", 0.006993006993006993], ["pleasant", 0.006993006993006993], ["met", 0.006993006993006993], ["complicated", 0.006993006993006993], ["boy", 0.006993006993006993], ["bible", 0.006993006993006993], ["central", 0.006993006993006993], ["dollars", 0.006993006993006993], ["thing", 0.006993006993006993], ["place", 0.006993006993006993], ["invitation", 0.006993006993006993], ["simple", 0.006993006993006993], ["sweet", 0.006993006993006993], ["billions", 0.006993006993006993], ["embarrassed", 0.006993006993006993], ["millions", 0.006993006993006993], ["twenty", 0.006993006993006993], ["three", 0.006993006993006993], ["long", 0.006993006993006993], ["torch", 0.006993006993006993], ["require", 0.006993006993006993], ["learn", 0.006993006993006993], ["making", 0.006993006993006993], ["margin", 0.006993006993006993], ["age", 0.006993006993006993], ["mind", 0.006993006993006993], ["confused", 0.006993006993006993], ["manner", 0.006993006993006993], ["complex", 0.006993006993006993], ["details", 0.006993006993006993], ["beach", 0.006993006993006993], ["product", 0.006993006993006993], ["waters", 0.006993006993006993], ["pick", 0.006993006993006993], ["paid", 0.006993006993006993], ["suffers", 0.006993006993006993], ["clear", 0.006993006993006993], ["lines", 0.006993006993006993], ["ocean", 0.006993006993006993], ["person", 0.006993006993006993], ["time", 0.006993006993006993], ["investments", 0.006993006993006993]], "sentiment": ["Gomburg\u2019s book, while first-rate on business details, suffers from Gomburg\u2019s central thesis, to the effect that Magnum Opus was a product of a complex of inabilities to love. Reading between the lines of Gomburg\u2019s book, it is increasingly clear that Gomburg is himself unloved and unable to love.\nNeither Miss Waters nor Gomburg, incidentally, discovered Noel Constant\u2019s investment method. Ransom K. Fern never discovered it either, though he tried hard enough.\nThe only person Noel Constant ever told was his son, Malachi, on Malachi\u2019s twenty-first birthday. That birthday party of two took place in Room 223 of the Wilburhampton. It was the first time father and son had ever met.\nMalachi had come to see Noel by invitation.\nHuman emotions being what they are, young Malachi Constant paid more attention to a detail in the room\u2019s furnishings than he did to the secret of how to make millions or even billions of dollars.\nThe money-making secret was so simple-minded to begin with, that it didn\u2019t require much attention. The most complicated part of it had to do with the manner in which young Malachi was to pick up the torch of Magnum Opus when Noel had, at long last, laid it down. Young Malachi was to ask Ransom K. Fern for a chronological list of the investments of Magnum Opus, and, reading down the margin, young Malachi would learn just how far old Noel had gone in the Bible, and where young Malachi should begin.\nThe detail in the furnishings of Room 223 that interested young Malachi so was a photograph of himself It was a photograph of himself at the age of three\u2014a photograph of a sweet, pleasant, game little boy on an ocean beach.\nIt was thumbtacked to the wall.\nIt was the only picture in the room.\nOld Noel saw young Malachi looking at the picture, and was confused and embarrassed by the whole thing about fathers and sons.

I did some things that other animals couldn\u2019t do. I learned all the languages spoken there. Beskudnikov himself had studied in England and France, and he liked to give his helpers orders in one or the other of those languages, which he expected all of them to understand. Very soon I made myself useful as a translator, telling them exactly what their master had said to them. I already knew Polish and Russian, which the servants had taught me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Armenian,\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I ever learned from my drunken parents was how to bray like a jackass or gibber like a monkey\u2014or snarl like a wolf.\u201d\nHe said that he also mastered every craft practiced in the shop, and, like me, had a knack for catching in a quick sketch a passable likeness of almost anybody or anything. \u201cAt the age often I myself was made an apprentice,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBy the age of fifteen,\u201d he went on, \u201cit was obvious to everyone that I was a genius. Beskudnikov himself felt threatened, so he assigned me a task which everyone agreed was impossible. He would promote me to journeyman only after I had drawn by hand a one-ruble note, front and back, good enough to fool the sharp-eyed merchants in the marketplace.\u201d\nHe grinned at me. \u201cThe penalty for counterfeiting in those days,\u201d he said, \u201cwas a public hanging in that same marketplace.\u201d\nYoung Dan Gregorian spent six months making what he and all his co-workers agreed was a perfect note. Beskudnikov called the effort childish, and tore it into little pieces.\nGregorian made an even better one, again taking six months to do so. Beskudnikov declared it to be worse than the first, and threw it into the fire.\nGregorian made still a better one, spending a full year on it this time. All the while, of course, he was also carrying out his regular chores around the shop and house. When he completed his third counterfeit, however, he put it in his pocket. He showed Beskudnikov the genuine ruble he had been copying instead.\nAs he had expected, the old man laughed at that one, too. But before Beskudnikov could destroy it, young Gregorian snatched it away and ran out into the marketplace. He bought a box of cigars with the genuine ruble, telling the tobacconist that the note was surely genuine, since it had come from Beskudnikov, engraver of the plates for the Imperial paper currency.", 0.11947916666666666], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["vonnegut", 0.06976744186046512], ["interviewer", 0.05813953488372093], ["twerp", 0.03488372093023256], ["snarf", 0.03488372093023256], ["people", 0.023255813953488372], ["ass", 0.023255813953488372], ["sense", 0.023255813953488372], ["teeth", 0.023255813953488372], ["imagine", 0.023255813953488372], ["false", 0.023255813953488372], ["class", 0.023255813953488372], ["person", 0.023255813953488372], ["cheeks", 0.023255813953488372], ["inserts", 0.011627906976744186], ["set", 0.011627906976744186], ["bicycle", 0.011627906976744186], ["pardon", 0.011627906976744186], ["taxicabs", 0.011627906976744186], ["saddles", 0.011627906976744186], ["yeah", 0.011627906976744186], ["insult", 0.011627906976744186], ["formless", 0.011627906976744186], ["wasn", 0.011627906976744186], ["specific", 0.011627906976744186], ["technically", 0.011627906976744186], ["graduating", 0.011627906976744186], ["funny", 0.011627906976744186], ["snarfield", 0.011627906976744186], ["ridge", 0.011627906976744186], ["seats", 0.011627906976744186], ["1940", 0.011627906976744186], ["girls", 0.011627906976744186], ["writing", 0.011627906976744186], ["buttons", 0.011627906976744186], ["listed", 0.011627906976744186], ["offending", 0.011627906976744186], ["usage", 0.011627906976744186], ["bite", 0.011627906976744186], ["happened", 0.011627906976744186], ["twerps", 0.011627906976744186], ["pretty", 0.011627906976744186], ["cornell", 0.011627906976744186], ["jr", 0.011627906976744186], ["meaning", 0.011627906976744186], ["feminists", 0.011627906976744186], ["understand", 0.011627906976744186], ["mindedly", 0.011627906976744186], ["reason", 0.011627906976744186], ["absent", 0.011627906976744186], ["short", 0.011627906976744186], ["strictest", 0.011627906976744186], ["sniff", 0.011627906976744186], ["armpits", 0.011627906976744186], ["turns", 0.011627906976744186], ["university", 0.011627906976744186], ["annual", 0.011627906976744186], ["beg", 0.011627906976744186], ["order", 0.011627906976744186], ["thought", 0.011627906976744186], ["careless", 0.011627906976744186], ["time", 0.011627906976744186], ["sniffing", 0.011627906976744186], ["kurt", 0.011627906976744186], ["original", 0.011627906976744186]], "sentiment": ["VONNEGUT: Yeah.

He ached and felt damp from his long nap by the brook. He yawned and stretched. \u201cTime to go,\u201d he said, his eyes still closed. \u201cOur day of peace is over.\u201d And then he saw that the boy was gone. He called the boy\u2019s name unconcernedly at first; and then, getting no answer but the wind\u2019s, he stood and shouted.\nPanic welled up in him. The boy had never been in the woods before, could easily get lost if he were to wander north, deeper into the hills and forest. He climbed onto higher ground and shouted again. No answer.\nPerhaps the boy had gone down to the tank again, and tried to cross the stream. He couldn\u2019t swim. The old man hurried downstream, around the bend to where he could see the tank. The ugly relic gaped at him balefully from across the cut. Nothing moved, and there was only the sound of wind and the water.\n\u201cBang!\u201d cried a small voice.\nThe boy raised his head from the turret triumphantly. \u201cGotcha!\u201d he said.\nBrighten Up\nThere was a time when I was at one with my Father in feeling that to become a reverent, brave, trustworthy, and courteous Eagle Scout was to lay the foundations for a bountiful life. But I have since had occasion to reflect more realistically upon twig-bending, and am wondering now if Hell\u2019s Kitchen isn\u2019t a more sound preparation for living than was the Beaver Patrol. I cannot help feeling that my friend Louis Gigliano, who had been smoking cigars since he was twelve, was a great deal better prepared to thrive in chaos than was I, who had been trained to meet adversity with a combination pocketknife, can opener, and leather punch.\nThe test of the manly art of surviving I have in mind took place in a prisoner-of-war camp in Dresden. I, a clean-cut American youth, and Louis, a dissipated little weasel whose civilian occupation had been hashish-peddling to bobby-soxers, faced life there together. I am remembering Louis now because I am stone-broke, and because I know that Louis is living like a prince somewhere in this world he understands too well. It was that way in Germany.\nUnder the democratic provisions of the Geneva Convention, we, as privates, were obliged to work for our keep. All of us worked, that is, but Louis. His first act behind barbed wire was to report to an English-speaking Nazi guard that he wanted no part of the war, which he considered to be brother against brother, and the handiwork of Roosevelt and Jewish international bankers.
