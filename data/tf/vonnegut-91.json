Taylor was a British historian whose controversial book The Origins of the Second World War argued that the outbreak of the war in 1939 was due to accidents of history rather than an intentional plan on the part of Hitler.\nDear Knox:\nTake this cheerful thing of A.J.P. Taylor\u2019s, and make some other people happy with it. I remember a girl I met once in Stow-on-the-Wold, and she said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t you try to sell England to me.\u201d I still sell it every chance I get. Funniest people in the world. Ben Hitz, my best man, went to a wedding of a British cousin a while back, was charmed by the insulting speech the British best man traditionally delivers on the faults of the groom. The groom beamed and bowed throughout. You and Miller have done good work in bringing the creative insult into currency, but I can\u2019t think of another American in the field. Your pal, Lenny Bruce, incidentally, turns out to be about as good a writer as any around.

actually says when he\u2019s using his own mind, when some genuinely gifted person hasn\u2019t written something for him to say?\u201d\nI made no reply and he went on: \u201cYou and I and your mother and your brother are descended from solid, stolid, thick-skulled, unimaginative, unmusical, ungraceful German stock whose sole virtue is that it can never leave off working. You see in me a man who was flattered and lied to and coddled out of his proper destiny, which was a life in business, in rendering some sort of plodding but useful service to his community. Don\u2019t throw away your destiny the way I did. Be what you were born to be. Be a pharmacist!\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo I become a pharmacist. But I never gave up on being a writer, too, although I stopped talking about it. I cut poor old Naomi Shoup dead the next time she dared mention my divine spark to me. I told her that I had no wish to be distracted from my first love, which was pharmacy. Thus was I without a single friend in this world again.\nI was permitted a certain number of electives when I enrolled as a pharmacy major at Ohio State. And, with nobody watching, so to speak, I took a course in play-writing in my sophomore year. I had by then heard of James Thurber, who had grown up right there in Columbus, and then gone on to New York City to write comically about the same sorts of people I had known in Midland City. And his biggest hit had been a play, The Male Animal.\n\u201cScooby dooby do-wop! Deedly-ah! Deedly ah!\u201d Maybe I could be like him.\nSo I turned my essay on John Fortune into a play.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWho was doing the housework back home meanwhile? I was still doing most of it. I wasn\u2019t your typical college boy, any more than I had been your typical high school boy. I still lived at home, but made the hundred-mile round-trip to Columbus three or four times a week, depending on what my schedule was.\nI cut down on fancy cooking, I must say. I served an awful lot of canned stew in those days, and sometimes I didn\u2019t get around to serving it until midnight, either.

The force he directed was the sworn enemy of drunks, thieves, murderers, rapists, looters, confidence men, prostitutes, and other disturbers of the peace, and it did its best to keep the city traffic moving.\n\u201cNoth\u2019s principal offense,\u201d said Westlake, \u201cwas that he introduced persons suspected of misdemeanors and crimes into a system of courts and penal institutions that was insane. Noth did his best to distinguish between the guilty and the innocent, using the most modern police methods; but those to whom he handed over his prisoners found the distinction of no importance. Merely to be in custody, with or without trial, was a crime. Prisoners of every sort were all to be humiliated, exhausted and killed.\u201d\nWestlake went on to say that the slave laborers who hanged Noth had no clear idea who he was, beyond the fact that he was somebody important. They hanged him for the satisfaction of hanging somebody important.\nNoth\u2019s house, said Westlake, had been demolished by Russian artillery, but Noth had continued to live in one undamaged room in the back. Westlake took an inventory of the room, found it to contain a bed, a table, and a candlestick. On the table were framed photographs of Helga, Resi, and Noth\u2019s wife.\nThere was a book. It was a German translation of The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius.\nWhy such a miserable magazine had bought such a fine piece of reporting was not explained. What the magazine was sure its readers would like was the description of the hanging itself.\nMy father-in-law was stood on a footstool four inches high. The rope was put around his neck and drawn tight over the limb of a budding apple tree. The footstool was then kicked out from under him. He could dance on the ground while he strangled.\nGood?\nHe was revived eight times, and hanged nine.\nOnly after the eighth hanging were his last bits of courage and dignity gone.

death by hanging. So it goes.\nAmericans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue, the monograph went on. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say, Napoleonic times.\nMany novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves. Once this is understood, the disagreeable behavior of American enlisted men in German prisons ceases to be a mystery.\nHoward W. Campbell, Jr., now discussed the uniform of the American enlisted in World War Two: Every other army in history, prosperous or not, has attempted to clothe even its lowliest soldiers so as to make them impressive to themselves and others as stylish experts in drinking and copulation and looting and sudden death. The American Army, however, sends its enlisted men out to fight and die in a modified business suit quite evidently made for another man, a sterilized but unpressed gift from a nose-holding charity which passes out clothing to drunks in the slums.\nWhen a dashingly-clad officer addresses such a frumpishly dressed bum, he scolds him, as an officer in any army must. But the officer\u2019s contempt is not, as in other armies, avuncular theatricality. It is a genuine expression of hatred for the poor, who have no one to blame for their misery but themselves.\nA prison administrator dealing with captured American enlisted men for the first time should be warned: Expect no brotherly love, even between brothers. There will be no cohesion between the individuals. Each will be a sulky child who often wishes he were dead.\nCampbell told what the German experience with captured American enlisted men had been. They were known everywhere to be the most self-pitying, least fraternal, and dirtiest of all prisoners of war, said Campbell. They were incapable of concerted action on their own behalf. They despised any leader from among their own number, refused to follow or even listen to him, on the grounds that he was no better than they were, that he should stop putting on airs.\nAnd so on. Billy Pilgrim went to sleep, woke up as a widower in his empty home in Ilium. His daughter Barbara was reproaching him for writing ridiculous letters to the newspapers.\n\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d Barbara inquired. It was 1968 again.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d He had been dozing.", 0.053160606060606054], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["unk", 0.07936507936507936], ["brackman", 0.05555555555555555], ["boaz", 0.031746031746031744], ["hospital", 0.023809523809523808], ["remembering", 0.023809523809523808], ["told", 0.015873015873015872], ["sergeant", 0.015873015873015872], ["thing", 0.015873015873015872], ["pain", 0.015873015873015872], ["hand", 0.015873015873015872], ["remember", 0.015873015873015872], ["looked", 0.015873015873015872], ["dreamed", 0.007936507936507936], ["keeping", 0.007936507936507936], ["held", 0.007936507936507936], ["fear", 0.007936507936507936], ["buddy", 0.007936507936507936], ["hadn", 0.007936507936507936], ["sky", 0.007936507936507936], ["tears", 0.007936507936507936], ["wet", 0.007936507936507936], ["circle", 0.007936507936507936], ["worth", 0.007936507936507936], ["happened", 0.007936507936507936], ["hit", 0.007936507936507936], ["worst", 0.007936507936507936], ["breast", 0.007936507936507936], ["hands", 0.007936507936507936], ["front", 0.007936507936507936], ["guard", 0.007936507936507936], ["bad", 0.007936507936507936], ["stupid", 0.007936507936507936], ["inside", 0.007936507936507936], ["direct", 0.007936507936507936], ["contracting", 0.007936507936507936], ["blouse", 0.007936507936507936], ["stood", 0.007936507936507936], ["god", 0.007936507936507936], ["laid", 0.007936507936507936], ["remorse", 0.007936507936507936], ["full", 0.007936507936507936], ["remembered", 0.007936507936507936], ["fault", 0.007936507936507936], ["soldier", 0.007936507936507936], ["place", 0.007936507936507936], ["footlocker", 0.007936507936507936], ["drunk", 0.007936507936507936], ["boax", 0.007936507936507936], ["oughta", 0.007936507936507936], ["loaded", 0.007936507936507936], ["cups", 0.007936507936507936], ["militarily", 0.007936507936507936], ["army", 0.007936507936507936], ["sneezing", 0.007936507936507936], ["kidding", 0.007936507936507936], ["live", 0.007936507936507936], ["damn", 0.007936507936507936], ["lot", 0.007936507936507936], ["kid", 0.007936507936507936], ["head", 0.007936507936507936], ["nickel", 0.007936507936507936], ["holy", 0.007936507936507936], ["started", 0.007936507936507936], ["vaguely", 0.007936507936507936], ["earnestly", 0.007936507936507936], ["account", 0.007936507936507936], ["straight", 0.007936507936507936], ["refusing", 0.007936507936507936], ["weren", 0.007936507936507936], ["silhouetting", 0.007936507936507936], ["problem", 0.007936507936507936], ["grenade", 0.007936507936507936], ["reveille", 0.007936507936507936], ["shook", 0.007936507936507936], ["heart", 0.007936507936507936], ["patrol", 0.007936507936507936], ["stubby", 0.007936507936507936], ["sleeping", 0.007936507936507936], ["pushed", 0.007936507936507936], ["sense", 0.007936507936507936], ["sat", 0.007936507936507936], ["thought", 0.007936507936507936], ["breaking", 0.007936507936507936], ["book", 0.007936507936507936], ["instinctively", 0.007936507936507936], ["venereal", 0.007936507936507936], ["explaining", 0.007936507936507936], ["wha", 0.007936507936507936], ["reporting", 0.007936507936507936], ["cleaning", 0.007936507936507936], ["man", 0.007936507936507936], ["weapon", 0.007936507936507936], ["smokes", 0.007936507936507936], ["disease", 0.007936507936507936], ["gruffly", 0.007936507936507936], ["order", 0.007936507936507936], ["drawing", 0.007936507936507936]], "sentiment": ["They looked as though Unk had done something as militarily stupid as silhouetting himself against the sky or cleaning a loaded weapon, as sneezing on patrol or contracting and not reporting a venereal disease, as refusing a direct order or sleeping through reveille, as being drunk on guard or drawing to an inside straight, as keeping a book or a live hand grenade in his footlocker, as asking who had started the Army anyway and why ...\nBoaz was the only one who looked sorry about what had happened to Unk. \"It was all my fault, Unk,\" he said.\nSergeant Brackman now pushed through the circle, stood over Unk and Boaz. \"Wha\u2019d he do, Boaz?\" said Brackman.\n\"I was kidding him, Sergeant,\" said Boax earnestly. \"I told him to try an\u2019 remember back as far as he could.

They were lonely women, widows; one middle-aged and the other young. Their meeting now\u2014ostensibly to defeat their loneliness\u2014only emphasized how solitary each was.\nRuth, the young woman, had travelled a thousand miles for this meeting with a stranger; had endured the clatter and soot and itch of a railroad coach from springtime in an Army town in Georgia to a factory town in a still-frozen New York valley. Now she wondered why it had seemed so right, so imperative that she come. This heavy, elderly woman, who blocked the door and smiled only with difficulty, had seemed in her letters to want this, too.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the woman who married my Ted,\u201d said the older woman coolly.\nRuth tried to imagine herself with a married son, and supposed she might have phrased the question in the same way. She set her bags down in the hall. She had expected to sweep into the apartment amid affectionate greetings, warm herself by a radiator, freshen up, and then begin to talk of Ted. Instead, her husband\u2019s mother seemed intent on examining her before letting her in. \u201cYes, Mrs. Faulkner,\u201d said Ruth, \u201cwe had five months together before he went overseas.\u201d Under the woman\u2019s critical stare, she found herself adding, almost defensively, \u201cA happy five months.\u201d\n\u201cTed was all I had,\u201d said Mrs. Faulkner.

the same law firm that represented Senator Rosewater, and had been since he was orphaned at the age of sixteen. The partner who looked after him was Reed McAllister. Old McAllister had enclosed a piece of literature with his last letter. It was called, \"A Rift Between Friends in the War of Ideas,\" a pamphlet published by the Pine Tree Press of the Freedom School, Box 165, Colorado Springs, Colorado. This was now serving as a bookmark in the railroad atlas.\nOld McAllister generally enclosed material about creeping socialism as opposed to free enterprise, because, some twenty years before, Stewart had come into his office, a wild-eyed young man, had announced that the free enterprise system was wrong, and that he wanted to give all his money to the poor. McAllister had talked the rash young man out of it, but he continued to worry about Stewart's having a relapse. The pamphlets were prophylaxis.\nMcAllister needn't have bothered. Drunk or sober, pamphlets or not, Stewart was irrevocably committed to free enterprise now. He did not require the bucking up in \"A Rift Between Friends in the War of Ideas,\" which was supposedly a letter from a conservative to close friends who were socialists without knowing it. Because he did not need to, Stewart had not read what the pamphlet had to say about the recipients of social security and other forms of welfare, which was this:\nHave we really helped these people? Look at them well. Consider this specimen who is the end result of our pity! What can we say to this third generation of people to whom welfare has long since become a way of life? Observe carefully our handiwork whom we have spawned and are spawning by the millions, even in times of plenty!\nThey do not work and will not. Heads down, unmindful, they have neither pride nor self-respect. They are totally unreliable, not maliciously so, but like cattle who wander aimlessly. Foresight and the ability to reason have simply atrophied from long neglect. Talk to them, listen to them, work with them as I do and you realize with a kind of dull horror that they have lost all semblance of human beings except that they stand on two feet and talk\u2014like parrots. \"More. Give me more. I need more,\" are the only new thoughts they have learned....\nThey stand today as a monumental caricature of Homo sapiens, the harsh and horrible reality created by us out of our own misguided pity. They are also, if we continue our present course, the living prophecy of what a great percentage of the rest of us will become.\nAnd so on.\nThese sentiments were coals to Newcastle as far as Stewart Buntline was concerned. He was through with misguided pity. He was through with sex, too.

more aggressively genuine bellybutton, exposed above his low-slung trousers. He no longer dresses that way, may I say, now that he is vice-president in charge of purchasing for Hospitality Associates, Ltd., a division of The RAMJAC Corporation. He is thirty years old now. His name is Israel Edel. Like my son, he is married to a black woman. He holds a Doctor\u2019s degree in history from Long Island University, summa cum laude, and is a Phi Beta Kappa. When we first met, in fact, Israel had to look up at me from the pages of The American Scholar, the Phi Beta Kappa learned monthly. Working as night clerk at the Arapahoe was the best job he could find.\n\u201cI have a reservation,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou have a what?\u201d he said. He was not being impudent. His surprise was genuine. No one ever made a reservation at the Arapahoe anymore. The only way to arrive there was unexpectedly, in response to some misfortune. As Israel said to me only the other day, when we happened to meet in an elevator, \u201cMaking a reservation at the Arapahoe is like making a reservation in a burn ward.\u201d He now oversees the purchasing at the Arapahoe, incidentally, which, along with about four hundred other hostelries all over the world, including one in Katmandu, is a Hospitality Associates, Ltd., hotel.\nHe found my letter of reservation in the otherwise vacant bank of pigeonholes behind him. \u201cA week?\u201d he said incredulously.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\nMy name meant nothing to him. His area of historical expertise was heresies in thirteenth-century Normandy. But he did glean that I was an ex-jailbird\u2014from the slightly queer return address on my envelope: a box number in the middle of nowhere in Georgia, and some numbers after my name.\n\u201cThe least we can do,\u201d he said, \u201cis to give you the Bridal Suite.\u201d\nThere was in fact no Bridal Suite. Every suite had long ago been partitioned into cells. But there was one cell, and only one, which had been freshly painted and papered\u2014as a result, I would later learn, of a particularly gruesome murder of a teen-age male prostitute in there. Israel Edel was not himself being gruesome now. He was being kind. The room really was quite cheerful.\nHe gave me the key, which I later discovered would open practically every door in the hotel.

\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to wait and see how Mr. Cady adapts himself, before we put anything else on the market. He\u2019s having a tough time, but he\u2019s got a good heart, I think, and we\u2019re all rooting for him.\u201d\nSouvenir\nJoe Bane was a pawnbroker, a fat, lazy, bald man, whose features seemed pulled to the left by his lifetime of looking at the world through a jeweler\u2019s glass. He was a lonely, untalented man and would not have wanted to go on living had he been prevented from playing every day save Sunday the one game he played brilliantly\u2014the acquiring of objects for very little, and the selling of them for a great deal more. He was obsessed by the game, the one opportunity life offered him to best his fellow men. The game was the thing, the money he made a secondary matter, a way of keeping score.\nWhen Joe Bane opened his shop Monday morning, a black ceiling of rainclouds had settled below the valley\u2019s rim, holding the city in a dark pocket of dead, dank air. Autumn thunder grumbled along the misty hillsides. No sooner had Bane hung up his coat and hat and umbrella, taken off his rubbers, turned on the lights, and settled his great bulk on a stool behind a counter than a lean young man in overalls, shy and dark as an Indian, plainly poor and awed by the city, walked in to offer him a fantastic pocketwatch for five hundred dollars.\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d said the young farmer politely. \u201cI don\u2019t want to borrow money on it. I want to sell it, if I can get enough for it.\u201d He seemed reluctant to hand it to Bane, and cupped it tenderly in his rough hands for a moment before setting it down on a square of black velvet. \u201cI kind of hoped to hang on to it, and pass it on to my oldest boy, but we need the money a whole lot worse right now.\u201d\n\u201cFive hundred dollars is a lot of money,\u201d said Bane, like a man who had been victimized too often by his own kindness. He examined the jewels studding the watch without betraying anything of his inner amazement. He turned the watch this way and that, catching the glare of the ceiling light in four diamonds marking the hours three, six, nine, and twelve, and the ruby crowning the winder. The jewels alone, Bane reflected, were worth at least four times what the farmer was asking.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get much call for a watch like this,\u201d said Bane. \u201cIf I tied up five hundred dollars in it, I might be stuck with it for years before the right man came along.\u201d He watched the farmer\u2019s sunburned face and thought he read there that the watch could be had for a good bit less.", 0.05426125876707272], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["women", 0.04597701149425287], ["patty", 0.034482758620689655], ["dwayne", 0.034482758620689655], ["father", 0.034482758620689655], ["keene", 0.034482758620689655], ["ready", 0.022988505747126436], ["thinking", 0.022988505747126436], ["going", 0.022988505747126436], ["machines", 0.022988505747126436], ["big", 0.022988505747126436], ["minds", 0.022988505747126436], ["sort", 0.011494252873563218], ["comfort", 0.011494252873563218], ["ten", 0.011494252873563218], ["drunk", 0.011494252873563218], ["reminded", 0.011494252873563218], ["turned", 0.011494252873563218], ["discover", 0.011494252873563218], ["high", 0.011494252873563218], ["case", 0.011494252873563218], ["cost", 0.011494252873563218], ["radio", 0.011494252873563218], ["trained", 0.011494252873563218], ["sexually", 0.011494252873563218], ["expensive", 0.011494252873563218], ["enemies", 0.011494252873563218], ["city", 0.011494252873563218], ["unusual", 0.011494252873563218], ["midland", 0.011494252873563218], ["hadn", 0.011494252873563218], ["ideas", 0.011494252873563218], ["pay", 0.011494252873563218], ["achieve", 0.011494252873563218], ["young", 0.011494252873563218], ["attracted", 0.011494252873563218], ["safety", 0.011494252873563218], ["sick", 0.011494252873563218], ["expected", 0.011494252873563218], ["survival", 0.011494252873563218], ["automobile", 0.011494252873563218], ["week", 0.011494252873563218], ["roses", 0.011494252873563218], ["agreeing", 0.011494252873563218], ["hawaiian", 0.011494252873563218], ["sickness", 0.011494252873563218], ["brand", 0.011494252873563218], ["plucking", 0.011494252873563218], ["reason", 0.011494252873563218], ["purpose", 0.011494252873563218], ["sing", 0.011494252873563218], ["sixteen", 0.011494252873563218], ["friends", 0.011494252873563218], ["appreciated", 0.011494252873563218], ["people", 0.011494252873563218], ["newness", 0.011494252873563218], ["school", 0.011494252873563218], ["stupid", 0.011494252873563218], ["animals", 0.011494252873563218], ["interests", 0.011494252873563218], ["country", 0.011494252873563218], ["needed", 0.011494252873563218], ["hawaii", 0.011494252873563218], ["times", 0.011494252873563218], ["thought", 0.011494252873563218], ["person", 0.011494252873563218], ["ditty", 0.011494252873563218], ["red", 0.011494252873563218], ["things", 0.011494252873563218], ["bills", 0.011494252873563218], ["trips", 0.011494252873563218]], "sentiment": ["This was in a country where everybody was expected to pay his own bills for everything, and one of the most expensive things a person could do was get sick.

The women all had big minds because they were big animals, but they did not use them much for this reason: unusual ideas could make enemies, and the women, if they were going to achieve any sort of comfort and safety, needed all the friends they could get.\nSo, in the interests of survival, they trained themselves to be agreeing machines instead of thinking machines. All their minds had to do was to discover what other people were thinking, and then they thought that, too.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.0090033879164314], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"},

he watched the barn, for the little boy had come out of his house, and was moving toward the barn as swiftly as his crutches would carry him. He disappeared into the barn for an agonizing long time. Paul heard his faint shriek, and saw him come to the door, carrying the soft white pelt with him. He rubbed it against his cheek, and then sank to the doorsill to bury his face in the fur and sob his heart out.\nPaul looked away, and did not look again. The other two did not see the child, and Paul did not tell them about him. When the three sat down to supper, one boy began grace: \u201cOur Father, we thank thee for this food thou hast set before us\u2026\u201d\nHeading for the American lines, moving casually from one village to the next, Paul\u2019s companions accumulated a sizeable quantity of German treasure. For some reason, all that Paul brought home was one rusty and badly bent Luftwaffe saber.\nJust You and Me, Sammy\nI.\nThis story is about soldiers, but it isn\u2019t exactly a war story. The war was over when it all happened, so I guess that makes it a murder story. No mystery, just murder.\nMy name is Sam Kleinhans. It\u2019s a German name, and, I\u2019m sorry to say, my father was mixed up in the German-American Bund in New Jersey for a while before the war. When he found out what it was all about, he got out in a hurry. But a lot of the people in our neighborhood went for the Bund in a big way. A couple of families on our street, I remember, got so excited about what Hitler was doing in the Fatherland, they sold everything they had, and went back to Germany to live.\nSome of their kids were just about my age, and, when the U.S. got into the war and I went overseas as a rifleman, I wondered if I might not wind up shooting at some of my old playmates. I don\u2019t think I did. I found out afterwards that most of the Bund kids who took out German citizenship wound up as riflemen on the Russian front. A few got into small-time intelligence work, trying to mix in with American troops without being noticed, but not many. The Germans didn\u2019t trust them worth a damn\u2014or at least that\u2019s what one of our former neighbors told Father in a letter asking him for a CARE parcel. The same man said he\u2019d do anything to get back to the States, and I imagine they all feel that way.\nBeing so close to them and the Bund monkey business made me pretty self-conscious about my German ancestry when we finally got into the war. I must have seemed like quite a jerk to a lot of the guys, sounding off the way I did about loyalty, fighting for a cause, and all that. Not that the other guys in the Army didn\u2019t believe in those things\u2014it\u2019s just that it wasn\u2019t fashionable to talk about them. Not in World War II.\nThinking back on it, I know I was corny. I remember what I said on the morning of May eighth, for instance, the day the war with Germany ended. \u201cIsn\u2019t it glorious!\u201d I said.", -0.038341750841750843], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
