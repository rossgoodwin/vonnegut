Underground (1970) that \u201cHigh school is closer to the core of the American experience than anything else I can think of.\u201d I believe from my own experience that those adolescent years shape much of our attitudes and perception of the world throughout our life and that Kurt\u2019s lifelong love of the underdog began with his antipathy to the \u201csports gods\u201d of his time\u2014and his humiliation by them in the trash-can incident. Seeing his father lose his fortune and having to close down his architecture office during the Depression, then losing what little business was left when building stopped during World War II, was surely also a significant factor in Kurt\u2019s becoming a champion of the underdog throughout his writing.\nWriting about the Republican Convention for Harper\u2019s magazine in 1972, Kurt concluded that \u201cThe two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers. The people do not acknowledge this. They claim membership in two imaginary parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, instead. Both imaginary parties are bossed by Winners. When Republicans battle Democrats, this much is certain: Winners will win.\u201d\nThere are two sources that are quoted throughout Vonnegut\u2019s writing, or are referenced in it, that seem essential to his outlook. One is the Sermon on the Mount. Invited to preach on Palm Sunday at St. Clement\u2019s Episcopal Church in New York in 1980, he said, \u201cI am enchanted by the Sermon on the Mount. Being merciful, it seems to me, is the only good idea we have received so far. Perhaps we will get another good idea by and by\u2014and then we will have two good ideas.\u201d The other is a quote from Eugene V. Debs, his fellow Hoosier, from Terre Haute, Indiana:\n\u201cWhile there is a lower class I am in it. While there is a criminal element I am of it. While there is a soul in prison I am not free.\u201d\nHe called that quote of Debs\u2019s \u201ca moving echo of the Sermon on the Mount\u201d in Timequake and used it as the epigraph to his novel Hocus Pocus, whose protagonist is \u201cEugene Debs Hartke.\u201d Hartke was named \u201cin honor of Eugene Debs \u2026 a Socialist and a Pacifist and a Labor Organizer who ran several times for the Presidency of the United States of America, and got more votes than has any other candidate nominated by a third party in the history of this country.\u201d\nIn Vonnegut\u2019s novel Cat\u2019s Cradle, about a proudly false prophet named Bokonon, he introduces his concept of a \u201ckarass.\u201d\n\u201cHumanity is organized into teams, teams that do God\u2019s Will without ever discovering what they are doing. Such a team is called a karass by Bokonon \u2026 \u2018If you find your life tangled up with somebody else\u2019s life for no very logical reasons,\u2019 writes Bokonon, \u2018that person may be a member of your karass.\u2019 \u201d\nIt was one of the great good fortunes of my life to find myself in Vonnegut\u2019s karass, and lucky for both of us to be in the same karass with the publisher Seymour \u201cSam\u201d Lawrence, who Kurt said years later in Timequake had \u201crescued me from certain oblivion, from smithereens, by publishing Slaughterhouse-Five, and then bringing all my previous books back into print under his umbrella.\u201d\nSam had published Slaughterhouse in 1969. A year later, when my agent sent my long-awaited (by only me) first novel to ten publishers, three made offers, but Sam was the only one who loved it. He asked if I minded him sending a copy to Vonnegut, since my novel was set in his own hometown of Indianapolis, and his endorsement would help Sam get the okay from his co-publisher and financial backer, Delacorte Press. I said it was all right with me, but at that point I had met Vonnegut only once in my life and I had no idea what he\u2019d think of the novel. The book I had sent him in 1965 was nonfiction, and my novel was nothing at all like Kurt\u2019s novels in style or story. The next thing I heard was that Kurt had sent a telegram to Sam Lawrence, telling him he must publish my novel and \u201cget that boy in our stable.\u201d\nKurt was like the godfather of that novel, Going All the Way (though his own suggested title was Getting Laid in Indianapolis). Sam even commissioned him to be my editor, and Kurt sent me a letter with ten suggestions to improve the book, stressing I should do only the things that \u201crang a bell\u201d with me and not do anything just because he suggested it. I did seven. (Vonnegut requested and received from Sam an Eames chair as payment for his editorial work.) Kurt came up from Cape Cod to Boston, where I was living, and took me to lunch at his favorite restaurant, Jacob Wirth\u2019s, an old German alehouse with sawdust on the floor.

It was cancer that killed her.\nAnd I realize now that the two main themes of my novels were stated by my siblings: \"Here I am cleaning shit off of practically everything\" and \"No pain.\" The contents of this book are samples of work I sold in order to finance the writing of the novels. Here one finds the fruits of Free Enterprise.\nI used to be a public relations man for General Electric, and then I became a free-lance writer of so-called \"slick fiction,\" a lot of it science fiction. Whether I improved myself morally by making that change I am not prepared to say. That is one of the questions I mean to ask God on Judgment Day\u2014 along with the one about what my sister\u2019s name really was.\nThat could easily be next Wednesday.\nI have already put the question to a college professor, who, climbing down into his Mercedes-Benz 300SL gran turismo, assured me that public relations men and slick writers were equally vile, in that they both buggered truth for money.\nI asked him what the very lowest grade of fiction was, and he told me, \"Science fiction.\" I asked where he was bound in such a rush, and learned that he had to catch a Fan-Jet. He was to speak at a meeting of the Modern Language Association in Honolulu the next morning. Honolulu was three thousand miles away.\nMy sister smoked too much. My father smoked too much. My mother smoked too much. I smoke too much. My brother used to smoke too much, and then he gave it up, which was a miracle on the order of the loaves and fishes.\nAnd one time a pretty girl came up to me at a cocktail party, and she asked me, \"What are you doing these days?\"\n\"I am committing suicide by cigarette,\" I replied.\nShe thought that was reasonably funny. I didn\u2019t. I thought it was hideous that I should scorn life that much, sucking away on cancer sticks. My brand is Pall Mall. The authentic suicides ask for Pall Malls.

I have corrected some spelling, removed some exclamation points, and all the italics are mine.\nI have in several instances changed names, in order to spare embarrassment or worse to innocent persons still living. The names Bernard B. O\u2019Hare, Harold J. Sparrow, and Dr. Abraham Epstein, for instance, are fictitious, insofar as this account goes. Also fictitious are Sparrow\u2019s Army serial number and the title I have given to an American Legion post in the text; there is no Francis X. Donovan Post of the American Legion in Brookline.\nThere is one point at which my accuracy rather than the accuracy of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., can be questioned. That point is in Chapter Twenty-two, in which Campbell quotes three of his poems in both English and German. In his manuscript, the English versions are perfectly clear. The German versions, however, recalled from memory by Campbell, are so hacked up and smeary with revisions as to be illegible, as often as not. Campbell was proud of himself as a writer in German, indifferent to his skill in English. In trying to justify his pride in his German, he worked over the German versions of the poems again and again and again, and was apparently never satisfied with them.\nSo, in order to offer some idea in this edition as to what the poems were like in German, I have had to commission a delicate job of restoration. The person who did this job, who made vases out of shards, so to speak, was Mrs. Theodore Rowley, of Cotuit, Massachusetts, a fine linguist, and a respectable poetess in her own right.\nI have made significant cuts in only two places. In Chapter Thirty-nine, I have made a cut that was insisted upon by my publisher\u2019s lawyer. In the original of that chapter, Campbell has one of the Iron Guardsmen of the White Sons of the American Constitution shouting at a G-man, \u201cI\u2019m a better American than you are! My father invented \u2018I-Am-An-American Day\u2019!\u201d Witnesses agree that such a claim was made, but made without any apparent basis in fact. The lawyer\u2019s feeling is that to reproduce the claim in the body of the text would be to slander those persons who really did invent \u201cI-Am-An-American Day.\u201d\nIn the same chapter, incidentally, Campbell is, according to witnesses, at his most accurate in reporting exactly what was said. The actual death speech of Resi Noth, all agree, is reproduced by Campbell, word for word.\nThe only other cutting I have done is in Chapter Twenty-three, which is pornographic in the original. I would have considered myself honor-bound to present that chapter unbowdlerized, were it not for Campbell\u2019s request, right in the body of the text, that some editor perform the emasculation.\nThe title of the book is Campbell\u2019s. It is taken from a speech by Mephistopheles in Goethe\u2019s Faust. As translated by Carlyle F. MacIntyre (New Directions, 1941), the speech is this:\nI am a part of the part that at first was all, part of the darkness that gave birth to light, that supercilious light which now disputes with Mother Night her ancient rank and space, and yet can not succeed; no matter how it struggles, it sticks to matter and can\u2019t get free. Light flows from substance, makes it beautiful; solids can check its path, so I hope it won\u2019t be long till light and the world\u2019s stuff are destroyed together.\nThe dedication of the book is Campbell\u2019s too. Of the dedication, Campbell wrote this in a chapter he later discarded:", 0.1361510513296228], "title": "Mother Night"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["hotel", 0.03260869565217391], ["dollar", 0.02717391304347826], ["haiti", 0.02717391304347826], ["american", 0.02717391304347826], ["door", 0.02717391304347826], ["james", 0.021739130434782608], ["jones", 0.021739130434782608], ["front", 0.016304347826086956], ["cottage", 0.016304347826086956], ["main", 0.010869565217391304], ["worth", 0.010869565217391304], ["real", 0.010869565217391304], ["dead", 0.010869565217391304], ["living", 0.010869565217391304], ["oloffson", 0.010869565217391304], ["opening", 0.010869565217391304], ["operating", 0.010869565217391304], ["white", 0.010869565217391304], ["ghost", 0.010869565217391304], ["porch", 0.010869565217391304], ["room", 0.010869565217391304], ["called", 0.010869565217391304], ["book", 0.010869565217391304], ["wife", 0.010869565217391304], ["rest", 0.005434782608695652], ["years", 0.005434782608695652], ["paper", 0.005434782608695652], ["follow", 0.005434782608695652], ["prince", 0.005434782608695652], ["supposedly", 0.005434782608695652], ["based", 0.005434782608695652], ["adolf", 0.005434782608695652], ["cliff", 0.005434782608695652], ["young", 0.005434782608695652], ["environment", 0.005434782608695652], ["insubstantial", 0.005434782608695652], ["brigade", 0.005434782608695652], ["couple", 0.005434782608695652], ["day", 0.005434782608695652], ["furniture", 0.005434782608695652], ["circulation", 0.005434782608695652], ["literary", 0.005434782608695652], ["wooden", 0.005434782608695652], ["married", 0.005434782608695652], ["release", 0.005434782608695652], ["ohio", 0.005434782608695652], ["bills", 0.005434782608695652], ["financial", 0.005434782608695652], ["1921", 0.005434782608695652], ["seitz", 0.005434782608695652], ["dear", 0.005434782608695652], ["novelist", 0.005434782608695652], ["port", 0.005434782608695652], ["airmail", 0.005434782608695652], ["conscience", 0.005434782608695652], ["sue", 0.005434782608695652], ["mccarthy", 0.005434782608695652], ["krementz", 0.005434782608695652], ["frank", 0.005434782608695652], ["duveneck", 0.005434782608695652], ["uneasy", 0.005434782608695652], ["host", 0.005434782608695652], ["jill", 0.005434782608695652], ["york", 0.005434782608695652], ["1934", 0.005434782608695652], ["appears", 0.005434782608695652], ["box", 0.005434782608695652], ["searches", 0.005434782608695652], ["owners", 0.005434782608695652], ["actual", 0.005434782608695652], ["dollars", 0.005434782608695652], ["rettig", 0.005434782608695652], ["gingerbread", 0.005434782608695652], ["honor", 0.005434782608695652], ["love", 0.005434782608695652], ["athens", 0.005434782608695652], ["hitler", 0.005434782608695652], ["size", 0.005434782608695652], ["city", 0.005434782608695652], ["stamp", 0.005434782608695652], ["jigsaw", 0.005434782608695652], ["three", 0.005434782608695652], ["treat", 0.005434782608695652], ["scheme", 0.005434782608695652], ["friend", 0.005434782608695652], ["interests", 0.005434782608695652], ["route", 0.005434782608695652], ["protect", 0.005434782608695652], ["mailed", 0.005434782608695652], ["survived", 0.005434782608695652], ["austere", 0.005434782608695652], ["1915", 0.005434782608695652], ["haitian", 0.005434782608695652], ["kind", 0.005434782608695652], ["john", 0.005434782608695652], ["utmost", 0.005434782608695652], ["hostess", 0.005434782608695652], ["shrunk", 0.005434782608695652], ["bill", 0.005434782608695652], ["worn", 0.005434782608695652], ["wallet", 0.005434782608695652], ["fanciful", 0.005434782608695652], ["marines", 0.005434782608695652], ["piece", 0.005434782608695652], ["gloria", 0.005434782608695652], ["describe", 0.005434782608695652], ["general", 0.005434782608695652], ["states", 0.005434782608695652], ["currency", 0.005434782608695652], ["au", 0.005434782608695652], ["exterior", 0.005434782608695652], ["occupied", 0.005434782608695652], ["united", 0.005434782608695652], ["built", 0.005434782608695652], ["painters", 0.005434782608695652], ["retiring", 0.005434782608695652], ["vanishes", 0.005434782608695652], ["stayed", 0.005434782608695652], ["doors", 0.005434782608695652], ["grand", 0.005434782608695652], ["ordinary", 0.005434782608695652], ["replacing", 0.005434782608695652], ["stay", 0.005434782608695652], ["seriousness", 0.005434782608695652], ["cigarette", 0.005434782608695652], ["decorated", 0.005434782608695652], ["man", 0.005434782608695652], ["ago", 0.005434782608695652], ["natural", 0.005434782608695652], ["1977", 0.005434782608695652], ["medical", 0.005434782608695652], ["headquarters", 0.005434782608695652], ["passes", 0.005434782608695652], ["jacket", 0.005434782608695652], ["orderly", 0.005434782608695652], ["time", 0.005434782608695652], ["subsequently", 0.005434782608695652], ["order", 0.005434782608695652]], "sentiment": ["There is a real hotel in this book, the Grand Hotel Oloffson in Port au Prince, Haiti. I love it, and so would almost anybody else. My dear wife Jill Krementz and I have stayed there in the so-called \u201cJames Jones Cottage,\u201d which was built as an operating room when the hotel was headquarters for a brigade of United States Marines, who occupied Haiti, in order to protect American financial interests there, from 1915 until 1934.\nThe exterior of that austere wooden box has subsequently been decorated with fanciful, jigsaw gingerbread, like the rest of the hotel.\nThe currency of Haiti, by the way, is based on the American dollar. Whatever an American dollar is worth, that is what a Haitian dollar is worth, and actual American dollars are in general circulation. There seems to be no scheme in Haiti, however, for retiring worn-out dollar bills, and replacing them with new ones. So it is ordinary there to treat with utmost seriousness a dollar which is as insubstantial as a cigarette paper, and which has shrunk to the size of an airmail stamp.\nI found one such bill in my wallet when I got home from Haiti a couple of years ago, and I mailed it back to Al and Sue Seitz, the owners and host and hostess of the Oloffson, asking them to release it into its natural environment. It could never have survived a day in New York City.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJames Jones (1921-1977), the American novelist, was actually married to his wife Gloria in the James Jones Cottage, before it was called that. So it is a literary honor to stay there.\nThere is supposedly a ghost\u2014not of James Jones, but of somebody else. We never saw it. Those who have seen it describe a young white man in a white jacket, possibly a medical orderly of some kind. There are only two doors, a back door opening into the main hotel, and the front door opening onto a porch. This ghost is said to follow the same route every time it appears. It comes in through the back door, searches for something in a piece of furniture which isn\u2019t there anymore, and then goes out the front door. It vanishes when it passes through the front door. It has never been seen in the main hotel or on the porch.\nIt may have an uneasy conscience about something it did or saw done when the cottage was an operating room.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere are four real painters in this book, one living and three dead. The living one is my friend in Athens, Ohio, Cliff McCarthy.

joke, of course, before my first near-death experience\u2014the accidental one.\nSo when my own time comes to join the choir invisible or whatever, God forbid, I hope someone will say, \u201cHe\u2019s up in Heaven now.\u201d Who really knows? I could have dreamed all this.\nMy epitaph in any case? \u201cEverything was beautiful. Nothing hurt.\u201d I will have gotten off so light, whatever the heck it is that was going on.\nHumanists, having received no credible information about any sort of God, are content to serve as well as they can, the only abstraction with which they have some familiarity: their communities. They don\u2019t have to join the A.H.A. to be one.\nYes, and this booklet of my conversations with the dead-and-buried was created in the hope that it would earn a little bit of money\u2014not for me, but for the National Public Radio station WNYC in downtown Manhattan. WNYC enhances the informed wit and wisdom of its community and mine. It does what no commercial radio or TV station can afford to do any more. WNYC satisfies the people\u2019s right to know\u2014as contrasted with, as abject slaves of high-roller publicists and advertisers, keeping the public vacantly diverted and entertained.\nWhereas formal religions surely comfort many members of the WNYC staff, that staff\u2019s collective effect on its community is humanism\u2014an ideal so Earthbound and unmajestic that I never capitalize it. As I have used it here, \u201chumanist\u201d is nothing more supernatural than a handy synonym for \u201cgood citizenship and common decency.\u201d\nI wish one and all long and happy lives, no matter what may become of them afterwards. Use sunscreen! Don\u2019t smoke cigarettes.\nCigars, however, are good for you. There is even a magazine celebrating their enjoyment, with male role models, athletes, actors, rich guys with trophy wives, on its covers. Why not the surgeon general? Cigars, of course, are made of trail mix, of crushed cashews and granola and raisins, soaked in maple syrup and dried in the sun. Why not eat one tonight at bedtime?\nFirearms are also good for you. Ask Charlton Heston, who once played Moses. Gunpowder has zero fat and zero cholesterol. That goes for dumdums, too. Ask your senator or senatrix or congressperson if guns, like cigars, aren\u2019t good for you.\nMy late Uncle Alex Vonnegut, my father\u2019s kid brother, a Harvard-educated life insurance agent in Indianapolis who was well read and wise, was a humanist like all the rest of the family.

She looked at the picture that was absorbing most of his attention.\n\u201cThe glass on it got cracked somehow,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I could go into town and get another one. Do you suppose that would be possible?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to ask the General about that, too. He says you\u2019re going to be a pretty busy boy around here, and I imagine he\u2019ll want you to stick close to the farm for a while, anyway. Sometimes,\u201d she said bitterly, \u201cthe girls walk into town and leave me to make the beds, wash the dishes, and straighten up the house all by myself\u2014like today. I suppose they could get you another glass, if you asked them, if they could leave off chasing boys long enough to do it.\u201d She studied the photograph. \u201cThose your folks?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my mother and father,\u201d said Haley gravely. \u201cThis was taken when they were very young, of course. You can tell that by the way Mother\u2019s got her hair fixed. They somehow never had many pictures taken of themselves together. This is about the only one.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re both very nice looking,\u201d said Annie. She squinted so as to see the picture more sharply. \u201cYou\u2019d never know that the General and your mother were brother and sister, except for maybe the lines around her eyes.\u201d She paused, and something like warmth came into her eyes for the first time since Haley had seen them. \u201cGolly,\u201d she said, \u201cI can imagine what you\u2019ve been through. We lost our mother while the war was going on, you know, and I had to kind of try and take over. Believe me, I know how you feel, Haley.\u201d\nHaley did not want to talk or think about it. He turned his back on her and busied himself with straightening the contents of his sock drawer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny about relatives, isn\u2019t it?\u201d mused Annie. \u201cHere you are my first cousin, even if it is by adoption, and I never laid eyes on you before today, and the General\u2019s never seen you. I just wonder where Kitty and Hope and I\u2019ll be twenty years from today.\u201d She made clucking noises and shook her head slowly.\nThe sound of voices and the crunching of footfalls in the gravel driveway below brought Haley and Annie from their separate reveries.\n\u201cI\u2019m good and sick of walking. You\u2019ve got a license. Why don\u2019t you put your foot down and demand to use the car?\u201d complained a girl\u2019s high, melodic voice.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your cousin Hope,\u201d said Annie. \u201cShe\u2019s about your

men alive. Now go downstairs and meet your cousin Hope. She\u2019s in the sunroom.\u201d\nAs Annie had promised, Haley found Hope in the sunroom, her quasi-adult figure clad in denim trousers and a man\u2019s shirt. She was seated tailor-fashion on the broad sill of a bay window. When she looked up at him, he felt as though his bones would melt. Her face was angelic beneath a honey-colored blizzard of close-cropped curls. The thoughtful depths of her dark green eyes, and the radiant cast of her features dispelled in an instant the image of Kitty that Haley had thought would be foremost in his thoughts for the rest of his life. \u201cWelcome to Ardennes Farm,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have another young person around. This place needs young ideas like nobody\u2019s business.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the farm had a name,\u201d said Haley.\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Hope wearily, \u201cit\u2019s in honor of a battle, just like everything else around here.\u201d\n\u201cAnnie said you were very pretty, and you are,\u201d said Haley, astonishing himself with his atypical gallantry, and with the sudden affection for Hope that surged within him.\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d said Hope, and Haley guessed that she hadn\u2019t heard him clearly, for her head was turned away from him, her gaze intent on what Haley perceived to be a horse-drawn wagon, making a fitful and noisy approach toward the house. \u201cLook at that idiot, that big, childish, old fool, Haley,\u201d she said irritably.\nAs the wagon drew nearer, Haley saw that it was not moving continuously, but was making a quick series of starts and stops, and that the man at the reins was standing on the empty wagon bed, dancing an abbreviated jig, and shouting at the top of his lungs, \u201cGiddyap! by golly; whoa! by golly; giddyap! blast you; whoa! blast you\u2026\u201d A pink froth wreathed the mouth corners of the stamping, rearing horses.\nHope jumped through the open window, onto the lawn below, and ran toward the wagon, waving her arms. She reached it when it was less than one hundred yards from where Haley stood squinting into the bright, level rays of the setting Sun. He watched with admiration Hope\u2019s courage and vigor, and with melancholy reflections of his own deficiency in those manly qualities, as she scrambled onto the wagon, stamped on it with fury, and berated the man at the reins.\n\u201cWhat do you want to do, kill the poor horses with those awful bits?\u201d Haley heard her say.\n\u201cI\u2019m darn well going to have the most obedient pair of horses in the state; that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do,\u201d bellowed the driver. \u201cNow get back in the house and set the table or something!\u201d He was short and plump, something like Annie, Haley thought, and he wore a disheveled ten-gallon hat, whose limp brim fluttered in the wind from the South, and occasionally slapped at his steel-rimmed spectacles as he argued. \u201cNow get! Go on and get! Giddyap! by golly.\u201d The wagon jolted forward ten feet. \u201cWhoa!\u201d The driver hauled back on the reins.", 0.09872685185185184], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf":

"sentiment": ["The materialization was going to take place, like a modern, civilized hanging, within high, blank, guarded walls. And the crowd outside the walls was very much like a crowd outside the walls at a hanging.\nThe crowd knew it wasn\u2019t going to see anything, yet its members found pleasure in being near, in staring at the blank walls and imagining what was happening inside. The mysteries of the materialization, like the mysteries of a hanging, were enhanced by the wall; were made pornographic by the magic lantern slides of morbid imaginations\u2014magic lantern slides projected by the crowd on the blank stone walls.\nThe town was Newport, Rhode Island, U.S.A., Earth, Solar System, Milky Way. The walls were those of the Rumfoord estate.\nTen minutes before the materialization was to take place, agents of the police spread the rumor that the materialization had happened prematurely, had happened outside the walls, and that the man and his dog could be seen plain as day two blocks away. The crowd galloped away to see the miracle at the intersection.\nThe crowd was crazy about miracles.\nAt the tail end of the crowd was a woman who weighed three hundred pounds. She had a goiter, a caramel apple, and a gray little six-year-old girl. She had the little girl by the hand and was jerking her this way and that, like a ball on the end of a rubber band. \"Wanda June,\" she said, \"if you don\u2019t start acting right, I\u2019m never going to take you to a materialization again.\"\nThe materializations had been happening for nine years, once every fifty-nine days. The most learned and trustworthy men in the world had begged heartbrokenly for the privilege of seeing a materialization. No matter how the great men worded their requests, they were turned down cold. The refusal was always the same, handwritten by Mrs. Rumfoord\u2019s social secretary.\nMrs. Winston Niles Rumfoord asks me to inform you that she is unable to extend the invitation you request. She is sure you will understand her feeling in the matter: that the phenomenon you wish to observe is a tragic family affair, hardly a fit subject for the scrutiny of outsiders, no matter how nobly motivated their curiosities.\nMrs. Rumfoord and her staff answered none of the tens of thousands of questions that were put to them about the materializations. Mrs. Rumfoord felt that she owed the world very little indeed in the way of information. She discharged that incalculably small obligation by issuing a report twenty-four hours after each materialization. Her report never exceeded one hundred words. It was posted by her butler in a glass case bolted to the wall next to the one entrance to the estate.\nThe one entrance to the estate was an Alice-in-Wonderland door in the west wall. The door was only four-and-a-half feet high. It was made of iron and held shut by a great Yale lock.", 0.05904709690893903], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "if-this-isnt-nice-what-is": {"tfidf": [["standing", 0.05263157894736842], ["good", 0.05263157894736842], ["love", 0.05263157894736842], ["laugh", 0.05263157894736842], ["sitting", 0.05263157894736842], ["god", 0.05263157894736842], ["year", 0.05263157894736842], ["drive", 0.05263157894736842], ["find", 0.05263157894736842], ["bless", 0.05263157894736842], ["jokes", 0.05263157894736842], ["weren", 0.05263157894736842], ["lonely", 0.05263157894736842], ["vonnegut", 0.05263157894736842], ["money", 0.05263157894736842], ["seasons", 0.05263157894736842], ["explains", 0.05263157894736842], ["safely", 0.05263157894736842], ["teacher", 0.05263157894736842]], "sentiment": ["possible?\nGood!\nNow say the name of that teacher\nto someone\nsitting or standing near you.\nAll done?\nThank you, and drive home safely,\nand God bless you all.\nHOW TO MAKE MONEY AND FIND LOVE!\nAs if that information weren\u2019t enough.

Though while writing these stories, Vonnegut had already seen the decimation of Dresden, had tramped amid the charred bodies of thousands of civilians, had spent time in a German POW camp, the stories in While Mortals Sleep have the bright-eyed clarity of a young man just beginning to understand the workings of the world. You can almost imagine a kindly looking guy in a cardigan and penny loafers writing the stories in a malt shop, filling the juke box with quarters, typing happily away.\nBut of course he wasn\u2019t that. He was a man with kids trying to support his family while edifying the readers of Ladies\u2019 Home Journal. Later, of course, he\u2019d be writing, repeatedly, about the end of the world. And sometimes incest, and often enough about the folly of war, and the greed and depravity of our industries and government. But for now, we have the eager young mousetrap maker, and we are his willing prey.\nCONTENTS\nCover\nOther Books by This Author\nTitle Page\nCopyright\nForeword by Dave Eggers\nJenny\nThe Epizootic", 0.17656249999999998], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["love", 0.07462686567164178], ["hugged", 0.04477611940298507], ["dogs", 0.04477611940298507], ["time", 0.04477611940298507], ["rolling", 0.029850746268656716], ["comedians", 0.029850746268656716], ["long", 0.029850746268656716], ["lot", 0.029850746268656716], ["treated", 0.029850746268656716], ["peace", 0.014925373134328358], ["decency", 0.014925373134328358], ["corps", 0.014925373134328358], ["people", 0.014925373134328358], ["find", 0.014925373134328358], ["confused", 0.014925373134328358], ["embarrassed", 0.014925373134328358], ["radio", 0.014925373134328358], ["rugs", 0.014925373134328358], ["film", 0.014925373134328358], ["described", 0.014925373134328358], ["person", 0.014925373134328358], ["twenty", 0.014925373134328358], ["poisonous", 0.014925373134328358], ["tired", 0.014925373134328358], ["three", 0.014925373134328358], ["uncritically", 0.014925373134328358], ["best", 0.014925373134328358], ["forest", 0.014925373134328358], ["affectionate", 0.014925373134328358], ["adopted", 0.014925373134328358], ["watching", 0.014925373134328358], ["great", 0.014925373134328358], ["rug", 0.014925373134328358], ["rain", 0.014925373134328358], ["amazon", 0.014925373134328358], ["birthday", 0.014925373134328358], ["experiences", 0.014925373134328358], ["ho", 0.014925373134328358], ["listening", 0.014925373134328358], ["child", 0.014925373134328358], ["distinguish", 0.014925373134328358], ["easily", 0.014925373134328358], ["forever", 0.014925373134328358], ["foolish", 0.014925373134328358], ["tremendously", 0.014925373134328358], ["leave", 0.014925373134328358], ["turn", 0.014925373134328358], ["sons", 0.014925373134328358], ["common", 0.014925373134328358], ["dane", 0.014925373134328358], ["nice", 0.014925373134328358], ["spend", 0.014925373134328358]], "sentiment": ["I have had some experiences with love, or think I have, anyway, although the ones I have liked best could easily be described as \u201ccommon decency.\u201d I treated somebody well for a little while, or maybe even for a tremendously long time, and that person treated me well in turn. Love need not have had anything to do with it.\nAlso: I cannot distinguish between the love I have for people and the love I have for dogs.\nWhen a child, and not watching comedians on film or listening to comedians on the radio, I used to spend a lot of time rolling around on rugs with uncritically affectionate dogs we had.\nAnd I still do a lot of that.

Have fun. It may increase your perspective to know what sorts of manipulators and custodians your unbelievable wealth has had up to now.\nLike so many great American fortunes, the Rosewater pile was accumulated in the beginning by a humorless, constipated Christian farm boy turned speculator and briber during and after the Civil War. The farm boy was Noah Rosewater, my great-grandfather, who was born in Rosewater County, Indiana.\nNoah and his brother George inherited from their pioneer father six hundred acres of farm-land, land as dark and rich as chocolate cake, and a small saw factory that was nearly bankrupt. War came.\nGeorge raised a rifle company, marched away at its head.\nNoah hired a village idiot to fight in his place, converted the saw factory to the manufacture of swords and bayonets, converted the farm to the raising of hogs. Abraham Lincoln declared that no amount of money was too much to pay for the restoration of the Union, so Noah priced his merchandise in scale with the national tragedy. And he made this discovery: Government objections to the price or quality of his wares could be vaporized with bribes that were pitifully small.\nHe married Cleota Herrick, the ugliest woman in Indiana, because she had four hundred thousand dollars. With her money he expanded the factory and bought more farms, all in Rosewater County. He became the largest individual hog farmer in the North. And, in order not to be victimized by meat packers, he bought controlling interest in an Indianapolis slaughterhouse. In order not to be victimized by steel suppliers, he bought controlling interest in a steel company in Pittsburgh. In order not to be victimized by coal suppliers, he bought controlling interest in several mines. In order not to be victimized by money lenders, he founded a bank.\nAnd his paranoid reluctance to be a victim caused him to deal more and more in valuable papers, in stocks and bonds, and less and less in swords and pork. Small experiments with worthless papers convinced him that such papers could be sold effortlessly. While he continued to bribe persons in government to hand over treasuries and national resources, his first enthusiasm became the peddling of watered stock.\nWhen the United States of America, which was meant to be a Utopia for all, was less than a century old, Noah Rosewater and a few men like him demonstrated the folly of the Founding Fathers in one respect: those sadly recent ancestors had not made it the law of the Utopia that the wealth of each citizen should be limited. This oversight was engendered by a weak-kneed sympathy for those who loved expensive things, and by the feeling that the continent was so vast and valuable, and the population so thin and enterprising, that no thief, no matter how fast he stole, could more than mildly inconvenience anyone.\nNoah and a few like him perceived that the continent was in fact finite, and that venal office-holders, legislators in particular, could be persuaded to toss up great hunks of it for grabs, and to toss them in such a way as to have them land where Noah and his kind were standing\nThus did a handful of rapacious citizens come to control all that was worth controlling in America. Thus was the savage and stupid and entirely inappropriate and unnecessary and humorless American class system created. Honest, industrious, peaceful citizens were classed as bloodsuckers, if they asked to be paid a living wage. And they saw that praise was reserved henceforth for those who devised means of getting paid enormously for committing crimes against which no laws had been passed. Thus the American dream turned belly up, turned green, bobbed to the scummy surface of cupidity unlimited, filled with gas, went bang in the noonday sun.", 0.09870129870129868], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["crown", 0.03333333333333333], ["dillinger", 0.03333333333333333], ["read", 0.025], ["point", 0.025], ["john", 0.025], ["jailor", 0.016666666666666666], ["hill", 0.016666666666666666], ["riley", 0.016666666666666666], ["soul", 0.016666666666666666], ["figler", 0.016666666666666666], ["letter", 0.016666666666666666], ["executed", 0.008333333333333333], ["shot", 0.008333333333333333], ["lack", 0.008333333333333333], ["rest", 0.008333333333333333], ["shoe", 0.008333333333333333], ["polish", 0.008333333333333333], ["cemetery", 0.008333333333333333], ["young", 0.008333333333333333], ["abiding", 0.008333333333333333], ["parents", 0.008333333333333333], ["woman", 0.008333333333333333], ["early", 0.008333333333333333], ["bank", 0.008333333333333333], ["school", 0.008333333333333333], ["stranger", 0.008333333333333333], ["james", 0.008333333333333333], ["alice", 0.008333333333333333], ["morning", 0.008333333333333333], ["prologue", 0.008333333333333333], ["notorious", 0.008333333333333333], ["summarily", 0.008333333333333333], ["people", 0.008333333333333333], ["idea", 0.008333333333333333], ["resist", 0.008333333333333333], ["escape", 0.008333333333333333], ["fail", 0.008333333333333333], ["best", 0.008333333333333333], ["will", 0.008333333333333333], ["federal", 0.008333333333333333], ["god", 0.008333333333333333], ["state", 0.008333333333333333], ["investigation", 0.008333333333333333], ["bureau", 0.008333333333333333], ["pistol", 0.008333333333333333], ["public", 0.008333333333333333], ["trout", 0.008333333333333333], ["core", 0.008333333333333333], ["november", 0.008333333333333333], ["prepared", 0.008333333333333333], ["received", 0.008333333333333333], ["sister", 0.008333333333333333], ["studied", 0.008333333333333333], ["place", 0.008333333333333333], ["kilgore", 0.008333333333333333], ["named", 0.008333333333333333], ["love", 0.008333333333333333], ["student", 0.008333333333333333], ["jailbreak", 0.008333333333333333], ["lies", 0.008333333333333333], ["agents", 0.008333333333333333], ["respect", 0.008333333333333333], ["hood", 0.008333333333333333], ["city", 0.008333333333333333], ["arrest", 0.008333333333333333], ["top", 0.008333333333333333], ["threatening", 0.008333333333333333], ["long", 0.008333333333333333], ["lot", 0.008333333333333333], ["time", 0.008333333333333333], ["poet", 0.008333333333333333], ["indiana", 0.008333333333333333], ["life", 0.008333333333333333], ["great", 0.008333333333333333], ["hoosier", 0.008333333333333333], ["highest", 0.008333333333333333], ["robber", 0.008333333333333333], ["high", 0.008333333333333333], ["ben", 0.008333333333333333], ["16", 0.008333333333333333], ["work", 0.008333333333333333], ["youth", 0.008333333333333333], ["robin", 0.008333333333333333], ["admired", 0.008333333333333333], ["disgrace", 0.008333333333333333], ["whitcomb", 0.008333333333333333], ["mine", 0.008333333333333333], ["escaped", 0.008333333333333333], ["single", 0.008333333333333333], ["good", 0.008333333333333333], ["buried", 0.008333333333333333], ["prevail", 0.008333333333333333], ["depression", 0.008333333333333333], ["soap", 0.008333333333333333], ["indianapolis", 0.008333333333333333], ["knew", 0.008333333333333333], ["depths", 0.008333333333333333], ["courtesy", 0.008333333333333333], ["law", 0.008333333333333333], ["1978", 0.008333333333333333], ["mother", 0.008333333333333333], ["chemistry", 0.008333333333333333]], "sentiment": ["Had read them, too.\nYou read nothing but the best, Ben,\nWhile I studied chemistry.\nLong time no see.\nPROLOGUE\nYES\u2014KILGORE TROUT is back again.

Crown Point is notorious for a jailbreak there by the bank robber John Dillinger, during the depths of the Great Depression. Dillinger escaped by threatening his jailor with a pistol made of soap and shoe polish. His jailor was a woman. God rest his soul, and her soul, too. Dillinger was the Robin Hood of my early youth. He is buried near my parents\u2014and near my sister Alice, who admired him even more than I did\u2014in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. Also in there, on the top of Crown Hill, the highest point in the city, is James Whitcomb Riley, \u201cThe Hoosier Poet.\u201d When my mother was little, she knew Riley well.\nDillinger was summarily executed by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was shot down in a public place, although he was not trying to escape or resist arrest. So there is nothing recent in my lack of respect for the F.B.I.\nJohn Figler is a law-abiding high-school student. He says in his letter that he has read almost everything of mine and is now prepared to state the single idea that lies at the core of my life\u2019s work so far. The words are his: \u201cLove may fail, but courtesy will prevail.\u201d", 0.1421674225245654], "title": "Jailbird"}, "petrified-ants": {"tfidf": [["peter", 0.06578947368421052], ["josef", 0.03289473684210526], ["pigpen", 0.019736842105263157], ["toy", 0.019736842105263157], ["mattress", 0.013157894736842105], ["brother", 0.013157894736842105], ["fiddle", 0.013157894736842105], ["bass", 0.013157894736842105], ["card", 0.013157894736842105], ["straw", 0.013157894736842105], ["room", 0.013157894736842105], ["layer", 0.013157894736842105], ["borgorov", 0.013157894736842105], ["thunderstorm", 0.013157894736842105], ["man", 0.013157894736842105], ["drunken", 0.006578947368421052], ["heavily", 0.006578947368421052], ["slashed", 0.006578947368421052], ["years", 0.006578947368421052], ["produced", 0.006578947368421052], ["bring", 0.006578947368421052], ["swears", 0.006578947368421052], ["upturned", 0.006578947368421052], ["quartered", 0.006578947368421052], ["speculating", 0.006578947368421052], ["police", 0.006578947368421052], ["better", 0.006578947368421052], ["cognac", 0.006578947368421052], ["seized", 0.006578947368421052], ["worse", 0.006578947368421052], ["miners", 0.006578947368421052], ["fingers", 0.006578947368421052], ["game", 0.006578947368421052], ["sighed", 0.006578947368421052], ["morning", 0.006578947368421052], ["facing", 0.006578947368421052], ["bag", 0.006578947368421052], ["bad", 0.006578947368421052], ["nose", 0.006578947368421052], ["small", 0.006578947368421052], ["barracks", 0.006578947368421052], ["beneath", 0.006578947368421052], ["myrmecologists", 0.006578947368421052], ["village", 0.006578947368421052], ["tempered", 0.006578947368421052], ["arm", 0.006578947368421052], ["steered", 0.006578947368421052], ["dense", 0.006578947368421052], ["avoid", 0.006578947368421052], ["washed", 0.006578947368421052], ["factory", 0.006578947368421052], ["shelter", 0.006578947368421052], ["laid", 0.006578947368421052], ["fossil", 0.006578947368421052], ["progress", 0.006578947368421052], ["stench", 0.006578947368421052], ["red", 0.006578947368421052], ["thin", 0.006578947368421052], ["kicked", 0.006578947368421052], ["job", 0.006578947368421052], ["boy", 0.006578947368421052], ["comrade", 0.006578947368421052], ["cot", 0.006578947368421052], ["leaves", 0.006578947368421052], ["turn", 0.006578947368421052], ["games", 0.006578947368421052], ["passing", 0.006578947368421052], ["bunks", 0.006578947368421052], ["raised", 0.006578947368421052], ["polished", 0.006578947368421052], ["wasn", 0.006578947368421052], ["jeweler", 0.006578947368421052], ["size", 0.006578947368421052], ["sponged", 0.006578947368421052], ["heads", 0.006578947368421052], ["long", 0.006578947368421052], ["dug", 0.006578947368421052], ["going", 0.006578947368421052], ["stuffed", 0.006578947368421052], ["white", 0.006578947368421052], ["threw", 0.006578947368421052], ["boomed", 0.006578947368421052], ["implored", 0.006578947368421052], ["hear", 0.006578947368421052], ["surface", 0.006578947368421052], ["child", 0.006578947368421052], ["eaves", 0.006578947368421052], ["ii", 0.006578947368421052], ["dirty", 0.006578947368421052], ["cards", 0.006578947368421052], ["stubby", 0.006578947368421052], ["handkerchief", 0.006578947368421052], ["slim", 0.006578947368421052], ["deep", 0.006578947368421052], ["ant", 0.006578947368421052], ["stubbornly", 0.006578947368421052], ["gloomily", 0.006578947368421052], ["sat", 0.006578947368421052], ["huge", 0.006578947368421052], ["sensitive", 0.006578947368421052], ["things", 0.006578947368421052], ["storage", 0.006578947368421052], ["forehead", 0.006578947368421052], ["amazing", 0.006578947368421052], ["laughed", 0.006578947368421052], ["place", 0.006578947368421052], ["savagely", 0.006578947368421052], ["firmly", 0.006578947368421052], ["conclusion", 0.006578947368421052], ["palms", 0.006578947368421052], ["probed", 0.006578947368421052], ["drink", 0.006578947368421052], ["hand", 0.006578947368421052], ["moment", 0.006578947368421052], ["mouth", 0.006578947368421052], ["hair", 0.006578947368421052], ["grow", 0.006578947368421052], ["walked", 0.006578947368421052], ["planks", 0.006578947368421052], ["greatest", 0.006578947368421052], ["bottle", 0.006578947368421052], ["breathed", 0.006578947368421052], ["drawing", 0.006578947368421052], ["left", 0.006578947368421052]], "sentiment": ["II\nA drunken, bad-tempered card game was in progress at the far end of the miners\u2019 barracks where Peter and Josef were quartered. A thunderstorm boomed and slashed outside. The brother myrmecologists sat facing each other on their bunks, passing their amazing fossil back and forth and speculating as to what Borgorov would bring from the storage shed in the morning.\nPeter probed his mattress with his hand\u2014straw, a thin layer of straw stuffed into a dirty white bag and laid on planks. Peter breathed through his mouth to avoid drawing the room\u2019s dense stench through his long, sensitive nose. \u201cCould it be a child\u2019s toy bass fiddle that got washed into that layer with the ant somehow?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know this place was once a toy factory.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever hear of a toy bass fiddle, let alone one that size?

He dug beneath his mattress and produced a bottle of cognac. \u201cDrink, Comrade?\u201d\n\u201cPeter!\u201d said Josef firmly. \u201cWe left some of our things in the village.

imagine with me a scene in the home of my childhood and youth in Indianapolis, in the middle of the previous Great Depression. The previous Great Depression lasted from the stock market crash on October 24th, 1929, until the Japanese did us the favor, for the sheer hell of it, of bombing our comatose fleet of warships in Pearl Harbor, on December 7th, 1941. The little yellow bastards, as we used to call them, were bored to tears with the Great Depression. So were we.\nImagine that it is 1938 again. I am sixteen again. I come home again from yet another lousy day at Shortridge High School. Mother, who does not work outside the home, says there is a new Saturday Evening Post on the coffee table. It is raining outside, and I am unpopular. But I can\u2019t turn on a magazine like a TV set. I have to pick it up, or it will go on lying there, dead as a doornail. An unassisted magazine has no get-up-and-go.\nAfter I pick it up, I have to make all one hundred sixty pounds of male adolescent meat and bones comfortable in an easy chair. Then I have to leaf through the magazine with my fingertips, so my eyes can shop for a story with a stimulating title and illustration.\nIllustrators during the golden age of American magazine fiction used to get as much money as the authors whose stories they illustrated. They were often as famous as, or even more famous than, the authors. Norman Rockwell was their Michelangelo.\nWhile I shop for a story, my eyes also see ads for automobiles and cigarettes and hand lotions and so on. It is advertisers, not readers, who pay the true costs of such a voluptuous publication. And God bless them for doing that. But consider the incredible thing I myself have to do in turn. I turn my brains on!\nThat isn\u2019t the half of it. With my brains all fired up, I do the nearly impossible thing that you are doing now, dear reader. I make sense of idiosyncratic arrangements, in horizontal lines, of nothing but twenty-six phonetic symbols, ten Arabic numerals, and perhaps eight punctuation marks, on a sheet of bleached and flattened wood pulp!\nBut get this: While I am reading, my pulse and breathing slow down. My high school troubles drop away. I am in a pleasant state somewhere between sleep and restfulness.\nOK?\nAnd then, after however long it takes to read a short story, ten minutes, say, I spring out of the chair. I put The Saturday Evening Post back on the coffee table for somebody else.\nOK?", 0.13868158327460653], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["book", 0.0449438202247191], ["feel", 0.033707865168539325], ["programmed", 0.02247191011235955], ["fifty", 0.02247191011235955], ["books", 0.02247191011235955], ["write", 0.02247191011235955], ["asshole", 0.02247191011235955], ["picture", 0.02247191011235955], ["head", 0.02247191011235955], ["novel", 0.02247191011235955], ["lousy", 0.02247191011235955], ["underpants", 0.02247191011235955], ["slope", 0.011235955056179775], ["things", 0.011235955056179775], ["character", 0.011235955056179775], ["idea", 0.011235955056179775], ["burger", 0.011235955056179775], ["scrawl", 0.011235955056179775], ["puppet", 0.011235955056179775], ["cumbersome", 0.011235955056179775], ["insult", 0.011235955056179775], ["nazi", 0.011235955056179775], ["planet", 0.011235955056179775], ["damaged", 0.011235955056179775], ["temptation", 0.011235955056179775], ["amounts", 0.011235955056179775], ["pictures", 0.011235955056179775], ["create", 0.011235955056179775], ["wiring", 0.011235955056179775], ["pen", 0.011235955056179775], ["eat", 0.011235955056179775], ["failed", 0.011235955056179775], ["written", 0.011235955056179775], ["microscopic", 0.011235955056179775], ["ascended", 0.011235955056179775], ["illustrations", 0.011235955056179775], ["philboyd", 0.011235955056179775], ["faulty", 0.011235955056179775], ["friend", 0.011235955056179775], ["fiftieth", 0.011235955056179775], ["junk", 0.011235955056179775], ["star", 0.011235955056179775], ["lot", 0.011235955056179775], ["spangled", 0.011235955056179775], ["read", 0.011235955056179775], ["big", 0.011235955056179775], ["felt", 0.011235955056179775], ["seemingly", 0.011235955056179775], ["chemicals", 0.011235955056179775], ["ate", 0.011235955056179775], ["tipped", 0.011235955056179775], ["characters", 0.011235955056179775], ["knox", 0.011235955056179775], ["years", 0.011235955056179775], ["banner", 0.011235955056179775], ["day", 0.011235955056179775], ["ago", 0.011235955056179775], ["going", 0.011235955056179775], ["throwing", 0.011235955056179775], ["perform", 0.011235955056179775], ["born", 0.011235955056179775], ["spine", 0.011235955056179775], ["clear", 0.011235955056179775], ["childishly", 0.011235955056179775], ["roof", 0.011235955056179775], ["studge", 0.011235955056179775], ["birthday", 0.011235955056179775], ["flags", 0.011235955056179775], ["empty", 0.011235955056179775], ["time", 0.011235955056179775], ["crossing", 0.011235955056179775], ["flag", 0.011235955056179775], ["assholes", 0.011235955056179775], ["maturity", 0.011235955056179775]], "sentiment": ["And so on.\nSo it is a big temptation to me, when I create a character for a novel, to say that he is what he is because of faulty wiring, or because of microscopic amounts of chemicals which he ate or failed to eat on that particular day.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhat do I myself think of this particular book?
