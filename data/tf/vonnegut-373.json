anything about the artist.\nDear Brother\u2014\nThis is almost like telling you about the birds and the bees.\nThere are many good people who are beneficially stimulated by some but not all man-made arrangements of colors and shapes on flat surfaces, essentially nonsense. You are gratified by some music, arrangements of noises, again essentially nonsense.\nIf I were to kick a bucket down the cellar stairs and then say to you that the racket I\u2019d made was philosophically on a par with The Magic Flute, this would not be the beginning of a long and pooping debate. An utterly satisfactory and complete response on your part would be, \u201cI like what Mozart did and I hate what the bucket did.\u201d Contemplating a purported work of art is a social activity. Either you have a good time or you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to say why afterwards. You don\u2019t have to say anything.\nYou are a justly revered experimentalist. If you really want to know whether your pictures are, as you say, \u201cart\u201d or not, you must display them in a public place somewhere, and then try to judge whether or not strangers liked to look at them, were glad that you had made them. That is the way the game is played. Let me know what happens.\nPeople capable of loving some paintings or etchings or whatever can rarely do this without knowing something about the artist. Again, the situation is social rather than scientific. Any work of art is one half of a conversation between two human beings, and it helps a lot to know who is talking at you. Does he or she have a reputation for seriousness, for sincerity? There are virtually no beloved or respected paintings made by persons of whom we know nothing. We can even surmise a lot about the lives of whoever did the paintings in the caves underneath Lascaux, France.\nSo I dare to suggest that no picture can attract serious attention without a human being attached to it in the viewer\u2019s mind. If you are unwilling to attach your name to your pictures, and to say why you hope others might find them rewarding to look at, there goes the ballgame right there. Pictures are famous for their human-ness and not their picture-ness.\nThere is also the matter of craftsmanship. Real picture lovers like to \u201cplay along,\u201d so to speak, to look closely at the surface to see how the illusion was created by nothing but an unusual human being, with hands and eyes. If you are unwilling to say how you made your pictures, there goes the ballgame a second time.", 0.1249092970521542], "title": "Letters"}}
