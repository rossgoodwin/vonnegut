Here\u2019s a toy. Forty-nine cents. I only make two cents on it.\"\nThe rube made a show of being a judicious shopper. He compared the toy with the real article it was supposed to represent. The real article was a Martian space ship on top of a column ninety-eight feet tall. The column and space ship were inside the walls of the Rumfoord estate\u2014 in the corner of the estate where the tennis courts had once been.\nRumfoord had yet to explain the purpose of the space ship, whose supporting column had been built with the pennies of school children from all over the world. The ship was kept in constant readiness. What was reputedly the longest free-standing ladder in history leaned against the column, led giddily to the door of the ship.\nIn the fuel cartridge of the space ship was the very last trace of the Martian war effort\u2019s supply of the Universal Will to Become.\n\"Uh huh,\" said the rube. He put the model back on the counter. \"If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll shop around a little more.\" So far, the only thing he had bought was a Robin Hood hat with a picture of Rumfoord on one side and a picture of a sailboat on the other, and with his own name stitched on the feather. His name, according to the feather, was Delbert. \"Thanks just the same,\" said Delbert. \"I\u2019ll probably be back.\"\n\"Sure you will, Delbert,\" said Brackman.\n\"How did you know my name was Delbert?\" said Delbert, pleased and suspicious.\n\"You think Winston Niles Rumfoord is the only man around here with supernatural powers?\" said Brackman.\nA jet of steam went up inside the walls. An instant later, the voice of the great steam whistle rolled over the booths\u2014mighty, mournful, and triumphant. It was the signal that Rumfoord and his dog would materialize in five minutes.\nIt was the signal for the concessionaires to stop their irreverent bawling of brummagem wares, to close their shutters.", 0.16816666666666666], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["cave", 0.043478260869565216], ["painted", 0.03260869565217391], ["paintings", 0.03260869565217391], ["books", 0.021739130434782608], ["spade", 0.021739130434782608], ["father", 0.021739130434782608], ["lights", 0.021739130434782608], ["mona", 0.021739130434782608], ["asked", 0.010869565217391304], ["pulsed", 0.010869565217391304], ["set", 0.010869565217391304], ["striking", 0.010869565217391304], ["german", 0.010869565217391304], ["house", 0.010869565217391304], ["finn", 0.010869565217391304], ["boned", 0.010869565217391304], ["brought", 0.010869565217391304], ["colors", 0.010869565217391304], ["bare", 0.010869565217391304], ["motor", 0.010869565217391304], ["aamons", 0.010869565217391304], ["earth", 0.010869565217391304], ["girl", 0.010869565217391304], ["drawing", 0.010869565217391304], ["pale", 0.010869565217391304], ["subject", 0.010869565217391304], ["tables", 0.010869565217391304], ["cut", 0.010869565217391304], ["generator", 0.010869565217391304], ["bears", 0.010869565217391304], ["pictures", 0.010869565217391304], ["kindergarten", 0.010869565217391304], ["three", 0.010869565217391304], ["lit", 0.010869565217391304], ["toothed", 0.010869565217391304], ["call", 0.010869565217391304], ["monzano", 0.010869565217391304], ["man", 0.010869565217391304], ["panting", 0.010869565217391304], ["hope", 0.010869565217391304], ["jungle", 0.010869565217391304], ["flat", 0.010869565217391304], ["boldness", 0.010869565217391304], ["electric", 0.010869565217391304], ["saber", 0.010869565217391304], ["frank", 0.010869565217391304], ["couple", 0.010869565217391304], ["clay", 0.010869565217391304], ["endlessly", 0.010869565217391304], ["french", 0.010869565217391304], ["early", 0.010869565217391304], ["walls", 0.010869565217391304], ["waterfall", 0.010869565217391304], ["designed", 0.010869565217391304], ["fall", 0.010869565217391304], ["worked", 0.010869565217391304], ["chips", 0.010869565217391304], ["cliff", 0.010869565217391304], ["ithyphallic", 0.010869565217391304], ["mercy", 0.010869565217391304], ["mammoths", 0.010869565217391304], ["natural", 0.010869565217391304], ["finnish", 0.010869565217391304], ["called", 0.010869565217391304], ["chairs", 0.010869565217391304], ["tigers", 0.010869565217391304], ["charcoal", 0.010869565217391304], ["scandinavian", 0.010869565217391304], ["aspects", 0.010869565217391304], ["thing", 0.010869565217391304], ["bookcase", 0.010869565217391304], ["steps", 0.010869565217391304], ["architecture", 0.010869565217391304], ["den", 0.010869565217391304], ["english", 0.010869565217391304], ["beneath", 0.010869565217391304], ["treated", 0.010869565217391304], ["order", 0.010869565217391304], ["talk", 0.010869565217391304], ["italian", 0.010869565217391304]], "sentiment": ["And he took me down to what he called his \u201cden\u201d in order that we might, \u201c\u2026 call a spade a spade, and let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\nSo we went down steps cut into a cliff and into a natural cave that was beneath and behind the waterfall.

Stern used to make extra money taking trips to Europe with students whose parents or guardians didn\u2019t want to see them over Christmas or during the summertime. He caught a lot of heck for taking some to Auschwitz. He did it impulsively and without asking permission from anyone. It wasn\u2019t on the schedule, and some of the students were very upset afterward.\nHe said in his lecture that if the fences and gallows and gas chambers were removed from the tidy, tidy checkerboard of streets and old stucco two-story shotgun buildings, it might have made a nice enough junior college for low-income or underachieving people in the area. The buildings had been put up years before World War I, he said, as a comfortable outpost for soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Among the many titles of that Emperor, he said, was Duke of Auschwitz.\nWHAT GENERAL FLORIO was after on our side of the lake was our sanitary facilities. The prisoners were to use buckets in their tents for toilets, but then these could be emptied into toilets in the surrounding buildings and flushed from there into Scipio\u2019s state-of-the-art sewage-disposal plant. Across the lake they were having to bury everything.\nAnd no showers.\nWe had plenty of showers.\nOne touching rather than horrible thing about the siege, surely, was how little damage the escaped convicts did to this campus. It was as though they really believed that it was going to be theirs for generations.\nThis brings to mind another of Damon Stern\u2019s lectures, which was about how the brutalized and starving poor people of Petrograd in Russia behaved after they broke into the palace of the Czars in 1917. They got to see for the first time all the treasures inside the palace, and they were so outraged they wanted to wreck them.\nBut then one man got their attention by firing a gun at the ceiling, and he said, \u201cComrades! Comrades! This is all ours now!
