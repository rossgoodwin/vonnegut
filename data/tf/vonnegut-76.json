And you are right in saying that what I write is slick. My mood with respect to my writing is wry. Eliza Doolittle\u2019s father was one of the undeserving poor and I am one of the undeserving artists.\nI wish you much luck, since you are the writer in my generation who could do the most with some real good luck. I would love to see somebody in my generation do something marvellous.\nThe ten-year-book will be important, without question. You are going to be disappointed in one respect, however: no matter what you say or how you say it, it will be published and widely read. When society found out it was honoring works of art by censoring them, it stopped doing it.\nOn your way to or from Provincetown, please do us the honor of stopping by. We\u2019re on 6A. We have no horse or Mary Jane, but plenty of gin, God knows. Since part of your big novel takes place on Cape Cod, and, since we\u2019ve lived on the Cape for ten years now, we could tell you some true and useful things that you might not know.\nYours

he said to Jane: \u201cMy dear Mrs. Vonnegut, pregnancy is the beginning, not the end, of life.\u201d\nThe point I want to make, though, is that one course I took required me to read and then be ready to discuss A Study of History by the English historian Arnold Toynbee, who is up in Heaven now. He wrote about challenges and responses, saying that various civilizations persisted or failed depending on whether or not the challenges they faced were just too much for them. He gave examples.\nThe same might be said for individuals who would like to behave heroically, and most strikingly in the case of Kilgore Trout on the afternoon and evening of February 13th, 2001, after free will kicked in. If he had been in the area of Times Square, or near the entrance or exit of a major bridge or tunnel, or at an airport, where pilots, as they had learned to do during the rerun, had expected their planes to take off or land safely of their own accord, the challenge would have been too much not only for Trout but for anyone else.\nWhat Trout beheld when he came out of the shelter in response to the crash next door was a horrifying scene all right, but the cast was small. The dead and dying were widely scattered, rather than heaped or enclosed in a burning or crumpled airplane or bus. They were still individuals. Alive or dead, they still had personalities, with stories to read in their faces and clothes.\nVehicular traffic on that stretch of West 155th Street, way-the-hell-and-gone uptown and leading nowhere, was at any time of day virtually nonexistent. This made the roaring hook-and-ladder a solo entertainer, as Trout watched gravity drag it ass-backward in the direction of the Hudson River. He was so free to think about the luckless fire truck in detail, despite the racket coming from busier thoroughfares, that he concluded calmly, as he would tell me at Xanadu, that one of three explanations for its helplessness had to be the right one: Either its gearshift was in reverse or neutral, or the drive shaft had snapped, or the clutch was shot.\nHe did not panic. His experiences as a forward observer for the artillery had taught him that panic only made things worse. He would say at Xanadu: \u201cIn real life, as in Grand Opera, arias only make hopeless situations worse.\nTrue enough, he didn\u2019t panic. At the same time, though, he had yet to realize that he alone was ambulatory and wide awake. He had figured out the bare bones of what the Universe itself had done, contracted and then expanded. That was the easy part. What was actually happening, except for its actuality, might easily have been the ink-on-paper consequences of a premise for a story he himself had written and torn to pieces, and flushed down a toilet in a bus terminal or whatever, years ago.\nUnlike Dudley Prince, Trout hadn\u2019t even earned a High School Equivalency Certificate, but he bore at least one surprising resemblance to my big brother Bernie, who has a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from MIT. Bernie and Trout had both, since their earliest adolescence, played games in their heads that began with this question: \u201cIf such-and-such were the case in our surroundings, what then, what then?\u201d\nWhat Trout had failed to extrapolate from the premise of the timequake and rerun, in the relative peace of the far end of West 155th Street, was that everybody for miles around was immobilized, if not by death or serious injury, then by PTA. He wasted precious minutes waiting for the arrival of healthy young ambulance crews and policepersons and more firepersons, and disaster specialists from the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who would take care of things.\nPlease remember, for God\u2019s sake: He was eighty-fucking-four years old! Since he shaved every day, he was often mistaken for a bag lady rather than a bag gentleman, even without his baby-blanket babushka, and so incapable of inspiring any respect whatsoever. As for his sandals: At least they were tough. They were made of the same material as the brake shoes on the Apollo 11 spacecraft, which had delivered Neil Armstrong to the Moon, where he was the first human being ever to walk on it, in 1969.",

clean and foursquare. I carry myself as though I\u2019ve made a quiet killing on the stock market, and have come to call more as a public service than anything else. When I arrive in clean wool, with crackling certificates and confidential stock analyses in crisp Manila folders, the reaction\u2014ideally and usually\u2014is the same accorded a minister or physician. I am in charge, and everything is going to be just fine.\nI deal mostly with old ladies\u2014the meek, who by dint of cast-iron constitutions have inherited sizable portions of the earth. I thumb through the clients\u2019 lists of securities, and relay our experts\u2019 suggestions for ways of making their portfolios\u2014or bonanzas or piles\u2014thrive and increase. I can speak of tens of thousands of dollars without a catch in my throat, and look at a list of securities worth more than a hundred thousand with no more fuss than a judicious \"Mmmmm, uh-huh.\"\nSince I don\u2019t have a portfolio, my job is a little like being a hungry delivery boy for a candy store. But I never really felt that way about it until Herbert Foster asked me to have a look at his finances.\nHe called one evening to say a friend had recommended me, and could I come out to talk business. I washed, shaved, dusted my shoes, put on my uniform, and made my grave arrival by cab.\nPeople in my business\u2014and maybe people in general\u2014 have an unsavory habit of sizing up a man\u2019s house, car, and suit, and estimating his annual income. Herbert Foster was six thousand a year, or I\u2019d never seen it. Understand, I have nothing against people in moderate circumstances, other than the crucial fact that I can\u2019t make any money off them. It made me a little sore that Foster would take my time, when the most he had to play around with, I guessed, was no more than a few hundred dollars. Say it was a thousand: my take would be a dollar or two at best.\nAnyway, there I was in the Fosters\u2019 jerry-built postwar colonial with expansion attic. They had taken up a local furniture store on its offer of three rooms of furniture, including ashtrays, a humidor, and pictures for the wall, all for $199.99. Hell, I was there, and I figured I might as well go through with having a look at his pathetic problem.\n\"Nice place you have here, Mr. Foster,\" I said. \"And this is your charming wife?\"\nA skinny, shrewish-looking woman smiled up at me vacuously. She wore a faded housecoat figured with a fox-hunting scene. The print was at war with the slipcover of the chair, and I had to squint to separate her features from the clash about her. \"A pleasure, Mrs. Foster,\" I said.

The voice of God came crashing down.

And then the elevator arrived, and *Zenji thought the top of his head would blow off when *MacIntosh got into it with him.\n\u201cLook\u2014\u201d said *MacIntosh on the way down, \u201cI\u2019m your friend. You can tell me anything. If I\u2019m what\u2019s bothering you, you can tell me to take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut, and I\u2019ll be the first to sympathize. I make mistakes. I\u2019m human.\u201d\nWhen they got down to the lobby, *Zenji\u2019s big brain gave him the impractical, almost infantile advice that he should somehow run away from *MacIntosh\u2014that he could beat this athletic American in a footrace.\nSo right out the front door of the hotel he went, and onto the cordoned-off section of the Calle Diez de Agosto, with *MacIntosh right beside him.\nThe two of them were across the lobby and out into the sunset so quickly that the unlucky von Kleist brother, *Siegfried, behind the bar in the cocktail lounge, couldn\u2019t even shout a warning to them in time. Too late, he cried, \u201cPlease! Please! I wouldn\u2019t go out there, if I were you!\u201d And then he ran after them.\nMany events which would have repercussions a million years later were taking place in a small space on the planet in a very short time. While the unlucky von Kleist brother was running after *MacIntosh and *Hiroguchi, the lucky one was taking a shower in his cabin just aft of the bridge of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin. He wasn\u2019t doing anything particularly important to the future of humankind, other than surviving, other than staying alive, but his first mate, whose name was Hernando Cruz, was about to take a radically influential action.\nCruz was outside on the sun deck, gazing, as it happened, at the only other ship in sight, the Colombian freighter San Mateo, long anchored in the estuary. Cruz was a stocky, bald man about the Captain\u2019s age, who had made fifty cruises out to the islands and back on other ships. He had been part of the skeleton crew which brought the Bah\u00eda de Darwin from Malm\u00f6. He had supervised her outfitting in Guayaquil, while the nominal captain had made a publicity tour of the United States. This man had stocked his big brain with a perfect understanding of every part of the ship, from the mighty diesels below to the ice-maker behind the bar in the main saloon. He moreover knew the personal strengths and weaknesses of every crewman, and had earned his respect.\nThis was the real captain, who would really run the ship while Adolf von Kleist, potching around in the shower now and singing, would charm the passengers at mealtimes, and dance with each and every one of the ladies at night.", 0.07186169183120403], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["brown", 0.034722222222222224], ["babyshit", 0.034722222222222224], ["called", 0.020833333333333332], ["terry", 0.020833333333333332], ["summer", 0.013888888888888888], ["unhappy", 0.013888888888888888], ["bars", 0.013888888888888888], ["living", 0.013888888888888888], ["kitchen", 0.013888888888888888], ["color", 0.013888888888888888], ["paint", 0.013888888888888888], ["suit", 0.013888888888888888], ["man", 0.013888888888888888], ["madison", 0.006944444444444444], ["woodwork", 0.006944444444444444], ["cheap", 0.006944444444444444], ["years", 0.006944444444444444], ["planning", 0.006944444444444444], ["gang", 0.006944444444444444], ["dorothy", 0.006944444444444444], ["bank", 0.006944444444444444], ["grabbed", 0.006944444444444444], ["justice", 0.006944444444444444], ["minute", 0.006944444444444444], ["pretty", 0.006944444444444444], ["local", 0.006944444444444444], ["real", 0.006944444444444444], ["wished", 0.006944444444444444], ["read", 0.006944444444444444], ["big", 0.006944444444444444], ["15", 0.006944444444444444], ["drinking", 0.006944444444444444], ["lady", 0.006944444444444444], ["winslow", 0.006944444444444444], ["association", 0.006944444444444444], ["school", 0.006944444444444444], ["bar", 0.006944444444444444], ["artist", 0.006944444444444444], ["married", 0.006944444444444444], ["wait", 0.006944444444444444], ["large", 0.006944444444444444], ["yale", 0.006944444444444444], ["guy", 0.006944444444444444], ["upstairs", 0.006944444444444444], ["people", 0.006944444444444444], ["hard", 0.006944444444444444], ["clubs", 0.006944444444444444], ["street", 0.006944444444444444], ["measure", 0.006944444444444444], ["incidentally", 0.006944444444444444], ["arguably", 0.006944444444444444], ["bought", 0.006944444444444444], ["supporting", 0.006944444444444444], ["redoing", 0.006944444444444444], ["clerk", 0.006944444444444444], ["men", 0.006944444444444444], ["brooks", 0.006944444444444444], ["wear", 0.006944444444444444], ["practically", 0.006944444444444444], ["convertible", 0.006944444444444444], ["wanted", 0.006944444444444444], ["boy", 0.006944444444444444], ["barns", 0.006944444444444444], ["experience", 0.006944444444444444], ["place", 0.006944444444444444], ["afternoon", 0.006944444444444444], ["nylon", 0.006944444444444444], ["major", 0.006944444444444444], ["drunk", 0.006944444444444444], ["celeste", 0.006944444444444444], ["private", 0.006944444444444444], ["thought", 0.006944444444444444], ["city", 0.006944444444444444], ["long", 0.006944444444444444], ["working", 0.006944444444444444], ["airborne", 0.006944444444444444], ["call", 0.006944444444444444], ["hamptons", 0.006944444444444444], ["john", 0.006944444444444444], ["happy", 0.006944444444444444], ["head", 0.006944444444444444], ["robbed", 0.006944444444444444], ["stocking", 0.006944444444444444], ["homer", 0.006944444444444444], ["polly", 0.006944444444444444], ["exception", 0.006944444444444444], ["decided", 0.006944444444444444], ["calls", 0.006944444444444444], ["policemen", 0.006944444444444444], ["second", 0.006944444444444444], ["books", 0.006944444444444444], ["supreme", 0.006944444444444444], ["san", 0.006944444444444444], ["estate", 0.006944444444444444], ["moved", 0.006944444444444444], ["native", 0.006944444444444444], ["ignacio", 0.006944444444444444], ["court", 0.006944444444444444], ["dressed", 0.006944444444444444], ["graduate", 0.006944444444444444], ["terrific", 0.006944444444444444], ["till", 0.006944444444444444], ["harlan", 0.006944444444444444], ["stepped", 0.006944444444444444], ["nice", 0.006944444444444444], ["explaining", 0.006944444444444444], ["altered", 0.006944444444444444], ["brothers", 0.006944444444444444], ["knew", 0.006944444444444444], ["questioning", 0.006944444444444444], ["moment", 0.006944444444444444], ["experiences", 0.006944444444444444], ["law", 0.006944444444444444], ["ago", 0.006944444444444444], ["remember", 0.006944444444444444], ["apology", 0.006944444444444444], ["potato", 0.006944444444444444], ["enthusiastic", 0.006944444444444444], ["drive", 0.006944444444444444], ["looked", 0.006944444444444444], ["berman", 0.006944444444444444], ["businessman", 0.006944444444444444], ["foyer", 0.006944444444444444]], "sentiment": ["So that\u2019s what he did with this summer, anyway: he read all the Polly Madison books!\n\u201cAfter I found out who she was,\u201d he said, \u201cand the way you\u2019d kept it from me, I became more enthusiastic than she was about redoing the foyer. I said that if she really wanted to make you happy, she would paint the woodwork babyshit brown.\u201d\nHe knew that I had had at least two unhappy experiences with the color practically everybody calls \u201cbabyshit brown.\u201d Even in San Ignacio when I was a boy, people called it \u201cbabyshit brown.\u201d\nOne experience took place outside Brooks Brothers years ago, where I had bought a summer suit which I thought looked pretty nice, which had been altered for me, and which I decided to wear home. I was then married to Dorothy, and we were still living in the city, and both still planning on my being a businessman. The minute I stepped outside, two policemen grabbed me for hard questioning. Then they let me go with an apology, explaining that a man had just robbed a bank down the street, with a lady\u2019s nylon stocking over his head. \u201cAll that anybody could tell us about him,\u201d one of them said to me, \u201cwas that his suit was babyshit brown.\u201d\nMy other unhappy association with that color had to do with Terry Kitchen. After Terry and I and several others in our gang moved out here for the cheap real estate and potato barns, Terry did his afternoon drinking at bars which were, in effect, private clubs for native working men. This was a man, incidentally, who was a graduate of Yale Law School, who had been a clerk to Supreme Court Justice John Harlan, and a major in the Eighty-second Airborne. I was not only supporting him in large measure: I was the one he called or had somebody else call from some bar when he was too drunk to drive home.\nAnd here is what Kitchen, arguably the most important artist ever to paint in the Hamptons, with the possible exception of Winslow Homer, is called in the local bars by the few who still remember him: \u201cThe guy in the babyshit-brown convertible.\u201d\n15\n\u201cWHERE IS MRS.

I was a sensational businessman in the beginning\u2014for the simple reason that there was so much business to be done. When I was working for General Electric, I wrote a story, \u201cReport on the Barnhouse Effect,\u201d the first story I ever wrote. I mailed it off to Collier\u2019s. Knox Burger was fiction editor there. Knox told me what was wrong with it and how to fix it. I did what he said, and he bought the story for seven hundred and fifty dollars, six weeks\u2019 pay at G.E. I wrote another, and he paid me nine hundred and fifty dollars, and suggested that it was perhaps time for me to quit G.E. Which I did. I moved to Provincetown. Eventually, my price for a short story got up to twenty-nine hundred dollars a crack. Think of that. And Knox got me a couple of agents who were as shrewd about storytelling as he was\u2014Kenneth Littauer, who had been his predecessor at Collier\u2019s, and Max Wilkinson, who had been a story editor for MGM. And let it be put on the record here that Knox Burger, who is about my age, discovered and encouraged more good young writers than any other editor of his time. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever been written down anywhere. It\u2019s a fact known only to writers, and one that could easily vanish, if it isn\u2019t somewhere written down.\nINTERVIEWER: Where is Knox Burger now?\nVONNEGUT: He\u2019s a literary agent. He represents my son Mark, in fact.\nINTERVIEWER: And Littauer and Wilkinson?\nVONNEGUT: Littauer died ten years ago or so. He was a colonel in the Lafayette Escadrille, by the way, at the age of twenty-three\u2014and the first pilot to strafe a trench. He was my mentor. Max Wilkinson has retired to Florida. It always embarrassed him to be an agent. If some stranger asked him what he did for a living, he always said he was a cotton planter.\nINTERVIEWER: Do you have a new mentor now?\nVONNEGUT: No. I guess I\u2019m too old to find one.

Inherited millions did not help. Nor did the arts and sciences.\nFred Rosewater was a good sailor and had attended Princeton University, so he was welcomed into the homes of the rich, though, for Pisquontuit, he was gruesomely poor. His home was a sordid little brown-shingle carpenter's special, a mile from the glittering waterfront.\nPoor Fred worked like hell for the few dollars he brought home once in a while. He was working now, beaming at the carpenter and the two plumbers in the news store. The three workmen were reading a scandalous tabloid, a national weekly dealing with murder, sex, pets, and children\u2014mutilated children, more often than not. It was called The American Investigator, \"The World's Most Sparkling Newspaper.\" The Investigator was to the news store what The Wall Street Journal was to the drugstore.\n\"Improving your minds as usual, I see,\" Fred observed. He said it with the lightness of fruitcake.\nThe workmen had an uneasy respect for Fred. They tried to be cynical about what he sold, but they knew in their hearts that he was offering the only get-rich-quick scheme that was open to them: to insure themselves and die soon. And it was Fred's gloomy secret that without such people, tantalized by such a proposition, he would not have a dime. All of his business was with the working class. His cavorting with the sailboat rajahs next door was bluster, bluff. It impressed the poor to think that Fred sold insurance to the canny rich, too, but it was not true. The estate plans of the rich were made in banks and law offices far, far away.\n\"What's the foreign news today?\" Fred inquired.

Sarah had warned me at the football game that afternoon that I must not mention suicide to Mrs. Sutton\u2014because Mr. Sutton had jumped out of his office window in Wall Street after the stock market crashed in Nineteen-hundred and Twenty-nine.\n\u201cIt is a nice place you have here, Mrs. Sutton,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only person who thinks so,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s crowded. Everything that goes on in the kitchen you can smell out here.\u201d\nIt was only a two-bedroom apartment. She had certainly come down in the world. Sarah said she used to have a horse farm in Connecticut and a house on Fifth Avenue, and on and on.\nThe walls of the little entrance hall were covered with blue ribbons from horse shows before the Crash. \u201cI see you have won a lot of blue ribbons,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cit was the horse that won those.\u201d\nWe were seated on folding chairs at a card table in the middle of the living room. There were no easy chairs, no couch. But the room was so jammed with breakfronts and escritoires and armoires and highboys and lowboys and Welsh dressers and wardrobes and grandfather clocks and so on, that I could not guess where the windows were. It turned out that she also stockpiled servants, all very old. A uniformed maid had let me in, and then exited sideways into a narrow fissure between two imposing examples of cabinetwork.\nNow a uniformed chauffeur emerged from the same fissure to ask Mrs. Sutton if she would be going anywhere in \u201cthe electric\u201d that night. Many people, especially old ladies, seemingly, had electric cars in those days. They looked like telephone booths on wheels. Under the floor were terribly heavy storage batteries. They had a stop speed of about eleven miles an hour and needed to be recharged every thirty miles or so. They had tillers, like sailboats, instead of steering wheels.\nMrs. Sutton said she would not be going anywhere in the electric, so the old chauffeur said that he would be going to the hotel, then. There were two other servants besides, whom I never saw. They were all going to spend the night at a hotel so that Sarah could have the second bedroom, where they ordinarily slept.\n\u201cI suppose this all looks very temporary to you,\u201d Mrs. Sutton said to me.", 0.012898478835978831], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["coughed", 0.034722222222222224], ["hoenikker", 0.020833333333333332], ["jack", 0.020833333333333332], ["franklin", 0.020833333333333332], ["man", 0.020833333333333332], ["shop", 0.013888888888888888], ["hobby", 0.013888888888888888], ["basement", 0.013888888888888888], ["railroad", 0.013888888888888888], ["boy", 0.013888888888888888], ["adored", 0.013888888888888888], ["kind", 0.013888888888888888], ["soul", 0.013888888888888888], ["bed", 0.013888888888888888], ["light", 0.013888888888888888], ["fall", 0.006944444444444444], ["soldiers", 0.006944444444444444], ["mommies", 0.006944444444444444], ["township", 0.006944444444444444], ["boundaries", 0.006944444444444444], ["hills", 0.006944444444444444], ["cunningly", 0.006944444444444444], ["lampposts", 0.006944444444444444], ["real", 0.006944444444444444], ["plate", 0.006944444444444444], ["good", 0.006944444444444444], ["seeking", 0.006944444444444444], ["trees", 0.006944444444444444], ["nation", 0.006944444444444444], ["boats", 0.006944444444444444], ["tanks", 0.006944444444444444], ["judge", 0.006944444444444444], ["porters", 0.006944444444444444], ["exquisitely", 0.006944444444444444], ["unnecessary", 0.006944444444444444], ["rockets", 0.006944444444444444], ["restless", 0.006944444444444444], ["rivers", 0.006944444444444444], ["sight", 0.006944444444444444], ["dear", 0.006944444444444444], ["spaghetti", 0.006944444444444444], ["scale", 0.006944444444444444], ["pattern", 0.006944444444444444], ["find", 0.006944444444444444], ["teeny", 0.006944444444444444], ["apologized", 0.006944444444444444], ["plywood", 0.006944444444444444], ["frank", 0.006944444444444444], ["daddies", 0.006944444444444444], ["filled", 0.006944444444444444], ["told", 0.006944444444444444], ["approached", 0.006944444444444444], ["automobiles", 0.006944444444444444], ["cadaverous", 0.006944444444444444], ["lakes", 0.006944444444444444], ["houses", 0.006944444444444444], ["tracks", 0.006944444444444444], ["firemen", 0.006944444444444444], ["textured", 0.006944444444444444], ["wait", 0.006944444444444444], ["country", 0.006944444444444444], ["place", 0.006944444444444444], ["natives", 0.006944444444444444], ["fantastic", 0.006944444444444444], ["engines", 0.006944444444444444], ["caught", 0.006944444444444444], ["question", 0.006944444444444444], ["cats", 0.006944444444444444], ["lot", 0.006944444444444444], ["perfectly", 0.006944444444444444], ["towns", 0.006944444444444444], ["dogs", 0.006944444444444444], ["store", 0.006944444444444444], ["life", 0.006944444444444444], ["lived", 0.006944444444444444], ["fire", 0.006944444444444444], ["hotel", 0.006944444444444444], ["airplanes", 0.006944444444444444], ["worked", 0.006944444444444444], ["hold", 0.006944444444444444], ["pull", 0.006944444444444444], ["double", 0.006944444444444444], ["policemen", 0.006944444444444444], ["rectangular", 0.006944444444444444], ["dirty", 0.006944444444444444], ["island", 0.006944444444444444], ["cab", 0.006944444444444444], ["shook", 0.006944444444444444], ["turned", 0.006944444444444444], ["head", 0.006944444444444444], ["ducks", 0.006944444444444444], ["tinted", 0.006944444444444444], ["presiding", 0.006944444444444444], ["cows", 0.006944444444444444], ["built", 0.006944444444444444], ["forests", 0.006944444444444444], ["hot", 0.006944444444444444], ["details", 0.006944444444444444], ["answer", 0.006944444444444444], ["blinding", 0.006944444444444444], ["dresser", 0.006944444444444444], ["week", 0.006944444444444444], ["sunshine", 0.006944444444444444], ["kansas", 0.006944444444444444], ["driver", 0.006944444444444444], ["conductors", 0.006944444444444444], ["lay", 0.006944444444444444], ["ago", 0.006944444444444444], ["wife", 0.006944444444444444], ["chickens", 0.006944444444444444], ["echoed", 0.006944444444444444], ["order", 0.006944444444444444], ["switch", 0.006944444444444444], ["edge", 0.006944444444444444], ["green", 0.006944444444444444], ["trains", 0.006944444444444444], ["serious", 0.006944444444444444], ["weeny", 0.006944444444444444], ["unmade", 0.006944444444444444], ["strings", 0.006944444444444444], ["squint", 0.006944444444444444], ["left", 0.006944444444444444]], "sentiment": ["HOBBY SHOP\nON THE WAY BACK to the hotel I caught sight of Jack\u2019s Hobby Shop, the place where Franklin Hoenikker had worked. I told the cab driver to stop and wait.\nI went in and found Jack himself presiding over his teeny-weeny fire engines, railroad trains, airplanes, boats, houses, lampposts, trees, tanks, rockets, automobiles, porters, conductors, policemen, firemen, mommies, daddies, cats, dogs, chickens, soldiers, ducks, and cows. He was a cadaverous man, a serious man, a dirty man, and he coughed a lot.\n\u201cWhat kind of a boy was Franklin Hoenikker?\u201d he echoed, and he coughed and coughed. He shook his head, and he showed me that he adored Frank as much as he\u2019d ever adored anybody. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a question I have to answer with words. I can show you what kind of a boy Franklin Hoenikker was.\u201d He coughed. \u201cYou can look,\u201d he said, \u201cand you can judge for yourself.\u201d\nAnd he took me down into the basement of his store.

They were smart. They drove one of the last Volkswagen Bugs still running.\nI knew where they kept the liquor. I poured myself a couple of stiff shots of bourbon, in lieu of their absent body warmth. I don\u2019t think I had had a drink for a month before that.\nI got this hot rush in my belly. Out into the night I went again. I was automatically looking for an older woman who would make everything all right by becoming the beast with two backs with me.\nA coed would not do, not that a coed would have had anything to do with somebody as old and relatively poor as me. I couldn\u2019t even have promised her a better grade than she deserved. There were no grades at Tarkington.\nBut I wouldn\u2019t have wanted a coed in any case. The only sort of woman who excites me is an older one in uncomfortable circumstances, full of doubts not only about herself but about the value of life itself. Although I never met her personally, the late Marilyn Monroe comes to mind, maybe 3 years before she committed suicide.\nCough, cough, cough.\nIF THERE IS a Divine Providence, there is also a wicked one, provided you agree that making love to off-balance women you aren\u2019t married to is wickedness. My own feeling is that if adultery is wickedness then so is food. Both make me feel so much better afterward.", 0.1450588837685612], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["plummer", 0.09009009009009009], ["helmholtz", 0.06306306306306306], ["drum", 0.06306306306306306], ["band", 0.02702702702702703], ["years", 0.018018018018018018], ["fine", 0.018018018018018018], ["shrug", 0.018018018018018018], ["growing", 0.018018018018018018], ["smile", 0.018018018018018018], ["stopped", 0.018018018018018018], ["caught", 0.009009009009009009], ["drums", 0.009009009009009009], ["cried", 0.009009009009009009], ["people", 0.009009009009009009], ["backing", 0.009009009009009009], ["year", 0.009009009009009009], ["eyes", 0.009009009009009009], ["paused", 0.009009009009009009], ["driveway", 0.009009009009009009], ["drowned", 0.009009009009009009], ["skin", 0.009009009009009009], ["ready", 0.009009009009009009], ["hell", 0.009009009009009009], ["chair", 0.009009009009009009], ["shrugged", 0.009009009009009009], ["arm", 0.009009009009009009], ["doorsill", 0.009009009009009009], ["afraid", 0.009009009009009009], ["concrete", 0.009009009009009009], ["things", 0.009009009009009009], ["began", 0.009009009009009009], ["long", 0.009009009009009009], ["freezes", 0.009009009009009009], ["rattle", 0.009009009009009009], ["tears", 0.009009009009009009], ["going", 0.009009009009009009], ["slowly", 0.009009009009009009], ["change", 0.009009009009009009], ["master", 0.009009009009009009], ["plaintive", 0.009009009009009009], ["limitations", 0.009009009009009009], ["feebly", 0.009009009009009009], ["head", 0.009009009009009009], ["formed", 0.009009009009009009], ["seized", 0.009009009009009009], ["itch", 0.009009009009009009], ["rims", 0.009009009009009009], ["big", 0.009009009009009009], ["musician", 0.009009009009009009], ["stared", 0.009009009009009009], ["yesterday", 0.009009009009009009], ["coffee", 0.009009009009009009], ["wistful", 0.009009009009009009], ["smiled", 0.009009009009009009], ["foot", 0.009009009009009009], ["intersection", 0.009009009009009009], ["table", 0.009009009009009009], ["coldly", 0.009009009009009009], ["tagging", 0.009009009009009009], ["man", 0.009009009009009009], ["boy", 0.009009009009009009], ["school", 0.009009009009009009], ["situations", 0.009009009009009009], ["sighed", 0.009009009009009009], ["process", 0.009009009009009009], ["panted", 0.009009009009009009], ["rumble", 0.009009009009009009], ["wait", 0.009009009009009009], ["light", 0.009009009009009009], ["cares", 0.009009009009009009], ["life", 0.009009009009009009], ["walked", 0.009009009009009009], ["face", 0.009009009009009009], ["thing", 0.009009009009009009], ["doorway", 0.009009009009009009], ["afternoon", 0.009009009009009009], ["mother", 0.009009009009009009], ["small", 0.009009009009009009], ["senior", 0.009009009009009009], ["voice", 0.009009009009009009], ["asked", 0.009009009009009009], ["shook", 0.009009009009009009]], "sentiment": ["Plummer stopped his backing. \u201cHow long?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOh, sometime in your senior year, perhaps.
