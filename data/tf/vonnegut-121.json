A tryst was arranged for April 14th, 1863, two years before Booth shot Lincoln from behind with a derringer. She went to New York City from Washington with a chaperone, the alcoholic wife of an admiral, ostensibly to shop, and to escape the tensions in the besieged capital. They checked into the hotel where Booth was staying, and attended his performance that night, as Marc Antony in Julius Caesar, by William Shakespeare.\nAs Marc Antony, Booth would speak lines horrifyingly prophetic in his case: \u201cThe evil that men do lives after them.\u201d\nJulia and her chaperone went backstage afterward and congratulated not only John Wilkes, but his brothers, Junius, who had played Brutus, and Edwin, who had played Cassius. The three American brothers, with John Wilkes the baby, in combination with their British father, Junius Brutus Booth, constituted what remains to this day the greatest family of tragedians in the history of the English-speaking stage.\nJohn Wilkes gallantly kissed the hand of Julia, as though they had just met, and simultaneously slipped her a packet of chloral hydrate crystals, which would be the active ingredient in a Mickey Finn for the chaperone.\nJulia had been given to believe by Booth that all she would receive from him when she came to his hotel room would be a single glass of champagne, and a single kiss she would cherish for the rest of her life after the war, back in Rhode Island, a life that would otherwise be humdrum. Madame Bovary!\nLittle did Julia suspect that Booth would mousetrap her champagne, just as she had mousetrapped her chaperone\u2019s beddy-bye slug of wartime white lightning, with chloral hydrate.\nTing-a-ling!\nBooth knocked her up!

He stared through shrewd, narrowed eyes at Pi Ying\u2019s knight, standing in the midst of the living chessmen. The horse\u2019s carved neck arched. Its nostrils flared.\nThe pure geometry of the white chessmen\u2019s fate burst upon Kelly\u2019s consciousness. Its simplicity had the effect of a refreshing, chilling wind. A sacrifice had to be offered to Pi Ying\u2019s knight. If Pi Ying accepted the sacrifice, the game would be Kelly\u2019s. The trap was perfect and deadly save for one detail\u2014bait.\n\"One minute, Colonel,\" said Pi Ying.\nKelly looked quickly from face to face, unmoved by the hostility or distrust or fear that he saw in each pair of eyes. One by one he eliminated the candidates for death. These four were vital to the sudden, crushing offense, and these must guard the king. Necessity, like a child counting eeny, meeny, miney, moe around a circle, pointed its finger at the one chessman who could be sacrificed. There was only one.\nKelly didn\u2019t permit himself to think of the chessman as anything but a cipher in a rigid mathematical proposition: if x is dead, the rest shall live. He perceived the tragedy of his decision only as a man who knew the definition of tragedy, not as one who felt it.\n\"Twenty seconds!\" said Barzov. He had taken the stop watch from Pi Ying.\nThe cold resolve deserted Kelly for an instant, and he saw the utter pathos of his position\u2014a dilemma as old as mankind, as new as the struggle between East and West. When human beings are attacked, x, multiplied by hundreds or thousands, must die\u2014sent to death by those who love them most. Kelly\u2019s profession was the choosing of x.\n\"Ten seconds,\" said Barzov.\n\"Jerry,\" said Kelly, his voice loud and sure, \"move forward one square and two to your left.\" Trustingly, his son stepped out of the back rank and into the shadow of the black knight. Awareness seemed to be filtering back into Margaret\u2019s eyes. She turned her head when her husband spoke.\nPi Ying stared down at the board in bafflement. \"Are you in your right mind, Colonel?\" he asked at last. \"Do you realize what you\u2019ve just done?\"", 0.05096681096681097], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["felix", 0.04285714285714286], ["city", 0.02857142857142857], ["midland", 0.02142857142857143], ["barry", 0.02142857142857143], ["mother", 0.02142857142857143], ["barrytron", 0.014285714285714285], ["arm", 0.014285714285714285], ["york", 0.014285714285714285], ["katmandu", 0.014285714285714285], ["play", 0.014285714285714285], ["plane", 0.014285714285714285], ["stamped", 0.007142857142857143], ["founder", 0.007142857142857143], ["produced", 0.007142857142857143], ["including", 0.007142857142857143], ["southwestern", 0.007142857142857143], ["birds", 0.007142857142857143], ["clapped", 0.007142857142857143], ["20", 0.007142857142857143], ["sky", 0.007142857142857143], ["employer", 0.007142857142857143], ["parents", 0.007142857142857143], ["systems", 0.007142857142857143], ["citizen", 0.007142857142857143], ["openings", 0.007142857142857143], ["whistle", 0.007142857142857143], ["cultural", 0.007142857142857143], ["lost", 0.007142857142857143], ["morning", 0.007142857142857143], ["nodding", 0.007142857142857143], ["frivolous", 0.007142857142857143], ["team", 0.007142857142857143], ["ohio", 0.007142857142857143], ["widow", 0.007142857142857143], ["england", 0.007142857142857143], ["people", 0.007142857142857143], ["house", 0.007142857142857143], ["belonged", 0.007142857142857143], ["alive", 0.007142857142857143], ["owner", 0.007142857142857143], ["second", 0.007142857142857143], ["empire", 0.007142857142857143], ["barrys", 0.007142857142857143], ["youth", 0.007142857142857143], ["acquaintance", 0.007142857142857143], ["opened", 0.007142857142857143], ["ice", 0.007142857142857143], ["weapons", 0.007142857142857143], ["imperative", 0.007142857142857143], ["imitator", 0.007142857142857143], ["closed", 0.007142857142857143], ["learned", 0.007142857142857143], ["trotters", 0.007142857142857143], ["full", 0.007142857142857143], ["murderer", 0.007142857142857143], ["power", 0.007142857142857143], ["opening", 0.007142857142857143], ["sole", 0.007142857142857143], ["fred", 0.007142857142857143], ["bachelor", 0.007142857142857143], ["commercially", 0.007142857142857143], ["manufacturer", 0.007142857142857143], ["sister", 0.007142857142857143], ["whistled", 0.007142857142857143], ["conversation", 0.007142857142857143], ["operas", 0.007142857142857143], ["twenty", 0.007142857142857143], ["reckoned", 0.007142857142857143], ["blizzard", 0.007142857142857143], ["passenger", 0.007142857142857143], ["appeared", 0.007142857142857143], ["private", 0.007142857142857143], ["son", 0.007142857142857143], ["brought", 0.007142857142857143], ["blank", 0.007142857142857143], ["ballets", 0.007142857142857143], ["traversing", 0.007142857142857143], ["festivals", 0.007142857142857143], ["landscape", 0.007142857142857143], ["museum", 0.007142857142857143], ["flying", 0.007142857142857143], ["music", 0.007142857142857143], ["curtain", 0.007142857142857143], ["white", 0.007142857142857143], ["globe", 0.007142857142857143], ["sophisticated", 0.007142857142857143], ["phone", 0.007142857142857143], ["lives", 0.007142857142857143], ["uninhibited", 0.007142857142857143], ["pilot", 0.007142857142857143], ["halls", 0.007142857142857143], ["born", 0.007142857142857143], ["cap", 0.007142857142857143], ["air", 0.007142857142857143], ["planet", 0.007142857142857143], ["claim", 0.007142857142857143], ["laughingstock", 0.007142857142857143], ["labrador", 0.007142857142857143], ["gadabouts", 0.007142857142857143], ["raging", 0.007142857142857143], ["single", 0.007142857142857143], ["british", 0.007142857142857143], ["airplane", 0.007142857142857143], ["fame", 0.007142857142857143], ["film", 0.007142857142857143], ["tireless", 0.007142857142857143], ["lifeless", 0.007142857142857143], ["length", 0.007142857142857143], ["stayed", 0.007142857142857143], ["largest", 0.007142857142857143], ["events", 0.007142857142857143], ["mock", 0.007142857142857143], ["polar", 0.007142857142857143], ["law", 0.007142857142857143], ["premiers", 0.007142857142857143], ["wife", 0.007142857142857143], ["clear", 0.007142857142857143], ["lines", 0.007142857142857143], ["mildred", 0.007142857142857143], ["counted", 0.007142857142857143]], "sentiment": ["I had to let my sister-in-law know that I was somebody to be reckoned with\u2014that I was a murderer. That was my claim to fame.\n20\nTHE MORNING AFTER Katmandu opened and closed, Felix and I were flying over a landscape as white and blank as our lives. Felix had lost his second wife. I was the laughingstock of New York. We were in a six-passenger private plane, traversing a southwestern Ohio which appeared to be as lifeless as a polar ice cap. Somewhere down there was Midland City. The power was off. The phone lines were out.\nHow could anyone still be alive down there?\nThe sky was clear, anyway, and the air was still. The blizzard which had done this was now raging somewhere off Labrador.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFelix and I were in a plane which belonged to Barrytron, Ltd., a manufacturer of sophisticated weapons systems, the largest single employer in Midland City. With us were Fred T. Barry, the founder and sole owner of Barrytron, and his mother, Mildred, and their pilot.\nMr. Barry was a bachelor and his mother was a widow, and they were tireless globe-trotters. Felix and I learned from their conversation that they had been to cultural events all over the planet\u2014arm-in-arm at film festivals and premiers of new ballets and operas, at openings of museum shows, and on and on. And I would be the last to mock them for being such frivolous gadabouts, since it was my play which had brought them and their airplane to New York City. They did not know me or Felix, nor had they more than a nodding acquaintance with our parents. But they had found it imperative that they be at the opening of the only full-length play by a citizen of Midland City which had ever been produced commercially.\nHow could I not like them for that?\nWhat is more: This mother-and-son team had stayed to the very end of Katmandu.

so they were incapable of falling in with precision. Painted on the floor were squares within which the recruits were to stand in order to form ranks and files pleasing to the eye. A game resembling musical chairs was now played, with several empty-eyed recruits scuffling for the same square. In time, each found a square of his own.\n\"All right,\" said Bee, \"take your plugs and plug up your noses and ears, please.\"\nThe recruits had been carrying the plugs in their clammy fists. They plugged their noses and ears.\nBee now went from recruit to recruit, making certain that all ears and nostrils were sealed.\n\"All right,\" she said, when her inspection was done. \"Very good,\" she said. She took from the table the roll of adhesive plaster. \"Now I am going to prove to you that you don\u2019t need to use your lungs at all, as long as you have Combat Respiratory Rations\u2014or, as you\u2019ll soon be calling them in the Army, goofballs.\" She moved through the ranks, snipping off lengths of adhesive, sealing mouths with them. No one objected. When she got through, no one had a suitable aperture through which to issue an objection.\nShe noted the time, and again turned on the music. For the next twenty minutes there would be nothing to do but watch the bare bodies for color changes, for the dying spasms in the sealed and useless lungs. Ideally, the bodies would turn blue, then red, then natural again within the twenty minutes\u2014and the rib cages would quake violently, give up, be still.\nWhen the twenty-minute ordeal was over, every recruit would know how unnecessary lung-breathing was. Ideally, every recruit would be so confident in himself and goofballs, when his course of instruction was over, that he would be ready to spring out of a space ship on the Earthling moon or on the bottom of an Earthling ocean or anywhere, without wondering for a split second what he might be springing into.\nBee sat on a bench.\nThere were dark circles around her fine eyes. The circles had come after she left the hospital, and they had grown more somber with each passing day. At the hospital, they had promised her that she would become more serene and efficient with each passing day. And they had told her that, if through some fluke she should not find this to be the case, she was to report back to the hospital for more help.\n\"We all need help from time to time,\" Dr. Morris N. Castle had said. \"It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. Some day I may need your help, Bee, and I won\u2019t hesitate to ask for it.\"", 0.15189033189033188], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["mary", 0.021834061135371178],

ghost of a ghost ship. I am the son of a big-brained science fiction writer, whose name was Kilgore Trout.\nI was a deserter from the United States Marines.\nI was given political asylum and then citizenship in Sweden, where I became a welder in a shipyard in Malm\u00f6. I was painlessly decapitated one day by a falling sheet of steel while working inside the hull of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, at which time I refused to set foot in the blue tunnel leading into the Afterlife.\nIt has always been within my power to materialize, but I have done that only once, very early in the game\u2014for a few wet and blustery moments during the storm my ship encountered in the North Atlantic during her voyage from Malm\u00f6 to Guayaquil. I appeared in the crow\u2019s nest, and one Swedish member of the skeleton crew saw me up there. He had been drinking. My decapitated body was facing the stern, and my arms were upraised. In my hands I was holding my severed head as though it were a basketball.\nSo I was invisible as I stood next to Captain Adolf von Kleist on the bridge of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin as we awaited the end of our first night at sea after our hasty departure from Guayaquil. He had been awake all night, and was sober now, but had a terrible headache, which he had described to Mary Hepburn as \u201c\u2026 a golden screw between my eyes.\u201d\nHe had other souvenirs of the previous evening\u2019s humiliating debauch\u2014contusions and abrasions from the several falls he had taken while trying to get up on the roof of the bus. He would never have gotten that drunk if he had realized that he was going to be saddled with any responsibilities. He had already explained that to Mary, who had been up all night, too\u2014nursing *James Wait on the sun deck, abaft of the officers\u2019 cabins.\n*Wait had been put up there, with Mary\u2019s rolled-up blouse for a pillow, because the rest of the ship was so dark. At least there was starlight up there after the moon went down. The plan was to move him into a cabin when the sun came up, so he would not fry to death on the bare steel plates.\nEverybody else was on the boat deck below. Selena MacIntosh was in the main saloon, using her dog for a pillow, and so were the six Kanka-bono girls. They were using each other for pillows. Hisako was in the head off the main saloon, and had fallen asleep while wedged between the toilet and the washbasin.\nMandarax, which Mary had turned over to the Captain, was in a drawer on the bridge. This was the only drawer on the whole ship with anything in it. It was slightly ajar, so that Mandarax had overheard and translated much of what had been said during the night. Thanks to a random setting, it translated everything into Kirghiz, including the Captain\u2019s plan of action, which went like this: They would go straight to the Gal\u00e1pagos island of Baltra, where there were docking facilities and an airfield and a small hospital. There was a powerful radio station there, so they would learn for certain what the two explosions had been, and how the rest of the world might be faring, in case a widespread shower of meteorites had taken place, or, as Mary had suggested, World War Three had begun.\nYes, and this plan might as well have been translated into Kirghiz, or some other language that practically nobody understood, because they were on a course which was going to cause them to miss the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands entirely.", -0.036655643738977076], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["people",

at City College by a fairly famous short-story writer named Martin Shoup. His stories were about black people, although he himself was white. Dan Gregory had illustrated at least a couple of them\u2014with the customary delight and sympathy he felt for people he believed to be orangutans.\nShoup said about my writing that I wasn\u2019t going to get very far until I became more enthusiastic about describing the looks of things\u2014and particularly people\u2019s faces. He knew I could draw, so he found it odd that I wouldn\u2019t want to go on and on about the looks of things.\n\u201cTo anybody who can drawn,\u201d I said, \u201cthe idea of putting the appearance of anything into words is like trying to make a Thanksgiving dinner out of ball bearings and broken glass.\u201d\n\u201cThen perhaps you had better resign from this course,\u201d he said. Which I did.\nI have no idea what finally became of Martin Shoup, either. Maybe he got killed in the war. Circe Berman never heard of him. Now you see him, now you don\u2019t.\nBulletin from the present: Paul Slazinger, who himself teaches creative writing from time to time, has come back into our lives in a great big way! All is forgiven, apparently. He is sound asleep here now in an upstairs bedroom. When he wakes up, we shall see what we shall see.\nThe Rescue Squad of the Springs Volunteer Fire Department brought him here at about midnight last night. He had awakened his neighbors in Springs by yelling for help out different windows of his house\u2014maybe every window he owned before he was through. The Rescue Squad wanted to take him to the Veterans Administration hospital at Riverhead. It was well known that he was a veteran. It is well known that I am a veteran.\nBut he calmed down, and he promised the rescuers that he would be all right if they brought him over here. So they rang my doorbell, and I received them in the foyer with its pictures of little girls on swings. Supported and restrained in the midst of the compassionate volunteers was a straitjacket containing the frantic meat of Slazinger. If I gave them permission, they were going to turn him loose as an experiment.\nCirce Berman had come down by then. We were both in our nightclothes. People do strange things when suddenly confronted by a person out of his or her mind. After taking one long, hard look at Slazinger, Circe turned her back on all of us and started straightening the pictures of the little girls on swings. So there was something this seemingly fearless woman was afraid of. She was petrified by insanity.\nInsane people are evidently Gorgons to her. If she looks at one, she turns to stone. There must be a story there.", 0.03633369633369636], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["premise", 0.03305785123966942], ["men", 0.024793388429752067], ["yankee", 0.024793388429752067], ["twain", 0.024793388429752067], ["connecticut", 0.024793388429752067], ["clear", 0.024793388429752067], ["years", 0.01652892561983471], ["genius", 0.01652892561983471], ["civilization", 0.01652892561983471], ["common", 0.01652892561983471], ["superstition", 0.01652892561983471], ["language", 0.01652892561983471], ["mark", 0.01652892561983471], ["war", 0.01652892561983471], ["technology", 0.01652892561983471], ["increasingly", 0.008264462809917356], ["resistance", 0.008264462809917356], ["fifty", 0.008264462809917356], ["ended", 0.008264462809917356], ["ghastly", 0.008264462809917356], ["superior", 0.008264462809917356], ["likeable", 0.008264462809917356], ["writing", 0.008264462809917356], ["innocent", 0.008264462809917356], ["fatal", 0.008264462809917356], ["good", 0.008264462809917356], ["return", 0.008264462809917356], ["harmed", 0.008264462809917356], ["read", 0.008264462809917356], ["annihilated", 0.008264462809917356], ["bloodlust", 0.008264462809917356], ["masters", 0.008264462809917356], ["shapes", 0.008264462809917356], ["bad", 0.008264462809917356], ["predicted", 0.008264462809917356], ["foolish", 0.008264462809917356], ["enforce", 0.008264462809917356], ["employing", 0.008264462809917356], ["england", 0.008264462809917356], ["ten", 0.008264462809917356], ["house", 0.008264462809917356], ["dead", 0.008264462809917356], ["sanity", 0.008264462809917356], ["opened", 0.008264462809917356], ["lead", 0.008264462809917356], ["guns", 0.008264462809917356], ["horrifyingly", 0.008264462809917356], ["seventy", 0.008264462809917356], ["american", 0.008264462809917356], ["wittiness", 0.008264462809917356], ["campaign", 0.008264462809917356], ["suddenly", 0.008264462809917356], ["wit", 0.008264462809917356], ["supple", 0.008264462809917356], ["armed", 0.008264462809917356], ["mere", 0.008264462809917356], ["story", 0.008264462809917356], ["joking", 0.008264462809917356], ["remains", 0.008264462809917356], ["twenty", 0.008264462809917356], ["start", 0.008264462809917356], ["fire", 0.008264462809917356], ["wars", 0.008264462809917356], ["western", 0.008264462809917356], ["1910", 0.008264462809917356], ["wise", 0.008264462809917356], ["will", 0.008264462809917356], ["gatling", 0.008264462809917356], ["entertainer", 0.008264462809917356], ["minutes", 0.008264462809917356], ["beautiful", 0.008264462809917356], ["storytelling", 0.008264462809917356], ["heard", 0.008264462809917356], ["sense", 0.008264462809917356], ["funny", 0.008264462809917356], ["built", 0.008264462809917356], ["author", 0.008264462809917356], ["swords", 0.008264462809917356], ["handsomely", 0.008264462809917356], ["book", 0.008264462809917356], ["speech", 0.008264462809917356], ["amusing", 0.008264462809917356], ["quote", 0.008264462809917356], ["misrepresented", 0.008264462809917356], ["persons", 0.008264462809917356], ["lay", 0.008264462809917356], ["decency", 0.008264462809917356], ["nation", 0.008264462809917356], ["totally", 0.008264462809917356], ["died", 0.008264462809917356], ["mood", 0.008264462809917356], ["short", 0.008264462809917356], ["age", 0.008264462809917356], ["sanest", 0.008264462809917356], ["chief", 0.008264462809917356], ["crazed", 0.008264462809917356], ["appalled", 0.008264462809917356], ["furnish", 0.008264462809917356], ["inexorably", 0.008264462809917356]], "sentiment": ["\u201c\u2019Within ten short minutes after we had opened fire, armed resistance was totally annihilated, the campaign was ended, we fifty-four were masters of England!

having heard her say she was Mrs. Jack Graham on the elevator:\nI do remember that I had trouble with my ears toward the top of the elevator ride, because of the sudden change in altitude. We shot up about a thousand feet, with no stops on the way. Also: Temporarily deaf or not, I had my conversational automatic pilot on. I was not thinking about what she was saying, or what I was saying, either. I thought that we were both so far outside the mainstream of human affairs that all we could do was comfort each other with animal sounds. I remember her saying at one point that she owned the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, and I thought I had not heard her right.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I said.\nSo, as I sat beside her on the bench in the harp showroom, she thought I had a piece of key information about her, which I did not have. And Delmar Peale had meanwhile called the police and had also sent Doris Kramm out, supposedly for coffee, but really to find a policeman out on the street somewhere.\nAs it happened, there was a small riot going on in the park adjacent to the United Nations, only three blocks away. Every available policeman was over there. Out-of-work white youths armed with baseball bats were braining men they thought were homosexuals. They threw one of them into the East River, who turned out to be the finance minister of Sri Lanka.\nI would meet some of those youths later at the police station, and they would assume that I, too, was a homosexual. One of them exposed his private parts to me and said, \u201cHey, Pops\u2014you want some of this? Come and get it. Yum, yum, yum,\u201d and so on.\nBut my point is that the police could not come and get me for nearly an hour. So Mary Kathleen and I had a nice long talk. She felt safe in this place. She dared to be sane.\nIt was most touching. Only her body was decrepit. Her voice and the soul it implied might well have belonged still to what she used to be, an angrily optimistic eighteen-year-old.\n\u201cEveryone is going to be all right now,\u201d she said to me in the showroom of The American Harp Company. \u201cSomething always told me that it would turn out this way. All\u2019s well that ends well,\u201d she said.\nWhat a fine mind she had! What fine minds all of the four women I\u2019ve loved have had! During the months I more or less lived with Mary Kathleen, she read all the books I had read or pretended to have read as a Harvard student. Those volumes had been chores to me, but they were a cannibal feast to Mary Kathleen. She read my books the way a young cannibal might eat the hearts of brave old enemies.

mother and my mother had one really bizarre symptom in common: neither one could stand to have her picture taken. They were usually fine in the daytime. They usually concealed their frenzies until late at night. But, if somebody aimed a camera at either one of them during the daytime, the mother who was aimed at would crash down on her knees and protect her head with her arms, as though somebody was about to club her to death. It was a scary and pitiful thing to see.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAt least Bunny\u2019s mother taught him how to control a piano, which was a music machine. At least Bunny Hoover\u2019s mother taught him a trade. A good piano controller could get a job making music in cocktail lounges almost anywhere in the world, and Bunny was a good one. His military training was useless, despite all the medals he won. The armed forces knew he was a homosexual, that he was certain to fall in love with other fighting men, and the armed forces didn\u2019t want to put up with such love affairs.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo Bunny Hoover now got ready to practice his trade. He slipped a black velvet dinner jacket over a black turtleneck sweater now. Bunny looked out his only window at the alleyway. The better rooms afforded views of Fairchild Park, where there had been fifty-six murders in the past two years. Bunny\u2019s room was on the second floor, so his window framed a piece of the blank brick side of what used to be the Keedsler Opera House.\nThere was an historical marker on the front of the former opera house. Not many people could understand it, but this is what it said:\nThe Opera House used to be the home of the Midland City Symphony Orchestra, which was an amateur group of music enthusiasts. But they became homeless in 1927, when the Opera House became a motion picture house, The Bannister. The orchestra remained homeless, too, until the Mildred Barry Memorial Center for the Arts went up.\nAnd The Bannister was the city\u2019s leading movie house for many years, until it was engulfed by the high crime district, which was moving north all the time.

It was a crude, slap-dash job, and I covered its faults with putty and the fake gilt.\nA few hours before sunrise, I glued the emblem to the desk, applied clamps, and dropped off to sleep. It was ready for the new commandant, exactly, save for the emblem, as I had designed it for the Russian.\nThey came for the desk early the next morning, a half-dozen soldiers and the captain. The desk looked like a casket for an Oriental potentate as they carried it like pallbearers across the street. The major met them at the door, and cried warnings whenever they threatened to bump the treasure against the doorframe.
