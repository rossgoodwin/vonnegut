I have a hide-a-bed in my study, and that\u2019s for you.\nI don\u2019t put my boat out on a mooring any more, because kids were always taking it out without my permission (kids not my own), and the weather was bashing the engine night and day. So it sits on a trailer in my yard, and I don\u2019t have to bother with going down to the yacht club and rowing out to a mooring any more. I just go down Scudder\u2019s Lane and stick her in. With this particular rig, we can cross the Cape and kill blues for a change, if that would interest you. I haven\u2019t tried that yet. I killed my first and last blue in 1952. They\u2019re big this year.\nI suppose I\u2019ll take off for Iowa City about September 10. I don\u2019t want to go, but everybody says it will be good for me. Jane will be left here with just two little girls. Think of it, all the people who used to live here. It will be a strangely good winter for Jane. She has taken up the piano, and, with me gone, she\u2019ll take up reading and writing again. She used to be excellent at both. [\u2026]\nDid I understand you correctly\u2014that you are thinking of becoming an agent? Whenever you start talking about something like that, you become cryptic and evasive, not to say hunted-looking.\nAfter a performance of Treasure Island at the Cape Playhouse last week, the cast went out on the lawn to mingle with the audience of children. The children, as has always been the custom, collected autographs of the American Theater Wing actors. Edith Vonnegut, as a gypsy, gave her autograph to Caroline Kennedy, a wide-eyed little kid.

Mississippi, but moved to St. Louis when he was seven. And it was he who named himself Tennessee when he was twenty-seven. Before he did that to himself, he was Tom.\nCole Porter was born in Peru, Indiana, pronounced PEEROO. \u201cNight and Day\u201d? \u201cBegin the Beguine\u201d? Not bad, not bad.\nKilgore Trout was born in a hospital in Bermuda, near where his father, Raymond, was gathering material for a follow-up on his doctoral dissertation on the last of the Bermuda Erns. The sole remaining rookery of those great blue birds, the largest of all pelagic raptors, was on Dead Man\u2019s Rock, an otherwise uninhabited lava steeple in the center of the notorious Bermuda Triangle. Trout was in fact conceived on Dead Man\u2019s Rock during his parents\u2019 honeymoon.\nWhat was particularly interesting about these erns was that the female birds, and not anything people had done, so far as anybody could tell, were to blame for the rapidly dwindling population. In the past, and presumably for thousands of years, the females had hatched their eggs, and tended the young, and finally taught them to fly by kicking them off the top of the steeple.\nBut when Raymond Trout went there as a doctoral candidate with his bride, he found that the females had taken to bowdlerizing the nurturing process by kicking the eggs off the top of the steeple.\nThus did Kilgore Trout\u2019s father providentially become a specialist, thanks to the female Bermuda Erns\u2019 initiative, or whatever you want to call it, in evolutionary mechanisms governing fates of species, mechanisms other than the Occam\u2019s Razor of Darwin\u2019s Natural Selection.\nNothing would do, then, but that the Trout family, when little Kilgore was nine, spend the summer of 1926 camped on the shore of Disappointment Lake in inland Nova Scotia. The Dalhousie Woodpeckers in that area had quit the brain-rattling business of pecking wood, and were feasting on the plentiful blackflies on the backs of deer and moose instead.\nDalhousies, of course, are the commonest woodpeckers in eastern Canada, mainly, ranging from Newfoundland to Manitoba, and from Hudson Bay to Detroit, Michigan. Only those around Disappointment Lake, however, identical with the rest in plumage and beak size and shape, and so on, had stopped getting at bugs the hard way, digging them out one at a time, from holes the bugs had made or found in tree trunks.\nThey were first observed gorging on blackflies in 1916, with World War One going on in the other hemisphere. The Disappointment Lake Dalhousies, however, were not subjected to observation year after year before that, or since. This was because the clouds of voracious blackflies, often resembling little tornadoes, according to Trout, made the apostate Dalhousies\u2019 habitat virtually uninhabitable by human beings.\nSo the Trout family spent the summer up there dressed like beekeepers night and day, in gloves, in long-sleeved shirts tied at the wrists, and long pants tied at the ankles, in wide-brimmed hats draped with gauze, to protect their heads and necks, no matter how hellishly hot the weather.

Americans began to feel much better. They were able to hold their food. And then it was time to go to Dresden. The Americans marched fairly stylishly out of the British compound. Billy Pilgrim again led the parade. He had silver boots now, and a muff, and a piece of azure curtain which he wore like a toga. Billy still had a beard. So did poor old Edgar Derby, who was beside him. Derby was imagining letters to home, his lips working tremulously:\nDear Margaret\u2014We are leaving for Dresden today. Don\u2019t worry. It will never be bombed. It is an open city. There was an election at noon, and guess what? And so on.\nThey came to the prison railroad yard again. They had arrived on only two cars. They would depart far more comfortably on four. They saw the dead hobo again. He was frozen stiff in the weeds beside the track. He was in a fetal position, trying even in death to nestle like a spoon with others. There were no others now. He was nestling with thin air and cinders. Somebody had taken his boots. His bare feet were blue and ivory. It was all right, somehow, his being dead. So it goes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe trip to Dresden was a lark. It took only two hours. Shriveled little bellies were full. Sunlight and mild air came in through the ventilators. There were plenty of smokes from the Englishmen.\nThe Americans arrived in Dresden at five in the afternoon. The boxcar doors were opened, and the doorways framed the loveliest city that most of the Americans had ever seen. The skyline was intricate and voluptuous and enchanted and absurd. It looked like a Sunday school picture of Heaven to Billy Pilgrim.\nSomebody behind him in the boxcar said, \u201cOz.\u201d That was I. That was me. The only other city I\u2019d ever seen was Indianapolis, Indiana.\nEvery other big city in Germany had been bombed and burned ferociously. Dresden had not suffered so much as a cracked windowpane. Sirens went off every day, screamed like hell, and people went down into cellars and listened to radios there. The planes were always bound for someplace else\u2014Leipzig, Chemnitz, Plauen, places like that. So it goes.\nSteam radiators still whistled cheerily in Dresden. Streetcars clanged. Telephones rang and were answered. Lights went on and off when switches were clicked. There were theaters and restaurants. There was a zoo. The principal enterprises of the city were medicine and food-processing and the making of cigarettes.\nPeople were going home from work now in the late afternoon.

Niles Rumfoord and Kazak, the hound of space. And their appearances on Mars were not irregular. Being chrono-synclastic infundibulated, Rumfoord and Kazak appeared as predictably as Halley\u2019s Comet. They appeared on Mars once every one hundred and eleven days.\nAs the letter to Unk said, (155.) According to Stony, this big guy and his dog show up at the meetings, and just snow everybody under. He is a big charm boy, and by the time a meeting is over everybody is trying to think just exactly the way he thinks. Every idea anybody has comes from him. He just smiles and smiles and yodels and yodels in that fancy voice of his, and fills everybody up with new ideas. And then all the people at the meeting pass around the ideas as though they had thought them up themselves. He is crazy about the game of German batball: Nobody knows what his name is. He just laughs, if anybody asks him. He usually wears the uniform of the Parachute Ski Marines, but the real commanders of the Parachute Ski Marines swear they\u2019ve never seen him anywhere but at the secret meetings.\n(156.) Unk, old pal, said the letter to Unk, every time you and Stony find out something new, add it on to this letter. Keep this letter well hidden. And every time you change its hiding place, be sure to tell Stony where you put it. That way, even if you go to the hospital to have your memory cleaned out, Stony can tell you where to go to have your memory filled up again.\n(157.) Unk\u2014you know why you keep on going? You keep on going because you have a mate and a child. Almost nobody on Mars has either one. Your mate\u2019s name is Bee. She is an instructress at the Schliemann Breathing School in Phoebe. Your son\u2019s name is Chrono. He lives in the grade school in Phoebe. According to Stony Stevenson, Chrono is the best German batball player in the school. Like everybody else on Mars, Bee and Chrono have learned to get along all alone. They don\u2019t miss you. They never think of you. But you have to prove to them that they need you in the biggest way possible.\n(158.) Unk, you crazy son-of-a-bitch, I love you. I think you are the cat\u2019s pajamas. When you get this little family of yours together, swipe a space ship and go flying away to somewhere peaceful and beautiful, some place where you don\u2019t have to take goofballs all the time to stay alive. Take Stony with you.

He replied that he had at last found something which was more fun than sexual intercourse.\nThe young colonel\u2019s feelings at the moment of release had to be transcendental, had to be entirely products of that big brain of his, since the plane did not shudder or yaw or suddenly climb or dive when the rocket departed to consummate its love affair. It continued on exactly as before, with the automatic pilot compensating instantly for the sudden change in the plane\u2019s weight and aerodynamics.\nAs for effects of the release visible to Reyes: The rocket was much too high to leave a vapor trail, and its exhaust was clean, so that, to Reyes, it was a rod which quickly shrank to a dot and then to a speck and then to nothingness. It vanished so quickly that it was hard to believe that it had ever existed.\nAnd that was that.\nThe only residue of the event in the stratosphere had to be in Reyes\u2019s big brain or nowhere. He was happy. He was humble. He was awed. He was drained.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nReyes wasn\u2019t crazy to feel that what he had done was analogous to the performance of a male during sexual intercourse. A computer over which he had no control, once he had turned it on, had determined the exact moment of release, and had delivered detailed instructions to the release machinery without any need of advice from him. He didn\u2019t know all that much about how the machinery worked anyway. Such knowledge was for specialists. In war, as in love, he was a fearless, happy-go-lucky adventurer.\nThe launching of the missile, in fact, was virtually identical with the role of male animals in the reproductive process.\nHere was what the colonel could be counted on to do: deliver the goods in an instant.", 0.1833838383838384], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["fred", 0.02877697841726619], ["jones", 0.02877697841726619], ["time", 0.02877697841726619], ["nora", 0.02158273381294964], ["machine", 0.02158273381294964], ["felt", 0.02158273381294964], ["corps", 0.014388489208633094], ["gun", 0.014388489208633094], ["kitchen", 0.014388489208633094], ["smoke", 0.014388489208633094], ["pollock", 0.014388489208633094], ["life", 0.014388489208633094], ["great", 0.014388489208633094], ["atmosphere", 0.007194244604316547], ["discovered", 0.007194244604316547], ["cocky", 0.007194244604316547], ["human", 0.007194244604316547], ["yonder", 0.007194244604316547], ["happiness", 0.007194244604316547], ["spirals", 0.007194244604316547], ["easy", 0.007194244604316547], ["struck", 0.007194244604316547], ["pleasers", 0.007194244604316547], ["balloons", 0.007194244604316547], ["achieve", 0.007194244604316547], ["civilian", 0.007194244604316547], ["dan", 0.007194244604316547], ["seemingly", 0.007194244604316547], ["hands", 0.007194244604316547], ["front", 0.007194244604316547], ["pst", 0.007194244604316547], ["lost", 0.007194244604316547], ["gift", 0.007194244604316547], ["artist", 0.007194244604316547], ["someday", 0.007194244604316547], ["blew", 0.007194244604316547], ["unexpected", 0.007194244604316547], ["honored", 0.007194244604316547], ["fired", 0.007194244604316547], ["crowd", 0.007194244604316547], ["doll", 0.007194244604316547], ["house", 0.007194244604316547], ["platforms", 0.007194244604316547], ["splotches", 0.007194244604316547], ["helix", 0.007194244604316547], ["depression", 0.007194244604316547], ["blue", 0.007194244604316547], ["canvas", 0.007194244604316547], ["jackson", 0.007194244604316547], ["assistance", 0.007194244604316547], ["find", 0.007194244604316547], ["rattletrap", 0.007194244604316547], ["falling", 0.007194244604316547], ["guns", 0.007194244604316547], ["told", 0.007194244604316547], ["kicked", 0.007194244604316547], ["chose", 0.007194244604316547], ["cork", 0.007194244604316547], ["spray", 0.007194244604316547], ["studio", 0.007194244604316547], ["armenian", 0.007194244604316547], ["dribbled", 0.007194244604316547], ["talent", 0.007194244604316547], ["reason", 0.007194244604316547], ["soldier", 0.007194244604316547], ["women", 0.007194244604316547], ["kemp", 0.007194244604316547], ["gregory", 0.007194244604316547], ["marilee", 0.007194244604316547], ["point", 0.007194244604316547], ["feel", 0.007194244604316547], ["wasn", 0.007194244604316547], ["downhill", 0.007194244604316547], ["startling", 0.007194244604316547], ["eye", 0.007194244604316547], ["caught", 0.007194244604316547], ["flying", 0.007194244604316547], ["paint", 0.007194244604316547], ["trails", 0.007194244604316547], ["expected", 0.007194244604316547], ["sunburst", 0.007194244604316547], ["war", 0.007194244604316547], ["kites", 0.007194244604316547], ["sort", 0.007194244604316547], ["trapped", 0.007194244604316547], ["airplanes", 0.007194244604316547], ["gripped", 0.007194244604316547], ["eyed", 0.007194244604316547], ["handsome", 0.007194244604316547], ["air", 0.007194244604316547], ["youth", 0.007194244604316547], ["flame", 0.007194244604316547], ["wild", 0.007194244604316547], ["engineers", 0.007194244604316547], ["beautiful", 0.007194244604316547], ["compare", 0.007194244604316547], ["sad", 0.007194244604316547], ["watched", 0.007194244604316547], ["airplane", 0.007194244604316547], ["funny", 0.007194244604316547], ["afraid", 0.007194244604316547], ["floor", 0.007194244604316547], ["things", 0.007194244604316547], ["elation", 0.007194244604316547], ["pure", 0.007194244604316547], ["dignified", 0.007194244604316547], ["draw", 0.007194244604316547], ["beauty", 0.007194244604316547], ["arcs", 0.007194244604316547], ["sacrifice", 0.007194244604316547], ["plane", 0.007194244604316547], ["terry", 0.007194244604316547], ["lacked", 0.007194244604316547], ["kid", 0.007194244604316547], ["observation", 0.007194244604316547], ["greatest", 0.007194244604316547], ["joystick", 0.007194244604316547]], "sentiment": ["Back to the past again:\nMarilee Kemp wasn\u2019t the only one who was trapped like Nora in A Doll\u2019s House before Nora blew her cork. I was another one. And then I caught on: Fred Jones was still another one. He was so handsome and dignified and honored, seemingly, to be of assistance to the great artist Dan Gregory in any way possible\u2014but he was a Nora, too.\nHis life had been all downhill since World War One, when he had discovered a gift for flying rattletrap kites which were machine-gun platforms. The first time he got his hands on the joystick of an airplane, he must have felt what Terry Kitchen felt when he gripped a spray gun. He must have felt like Kitchen again when he fired his machine guns up in the wild blue yonder, and saw a plane in front of him draw a helix of smoke and flame\u2014ending in a sunburst far below.\nWhat beauty! So unexpected and pure! So easy to achieve!\nFred Jones told me one time that the smoke trails of falling airplanes and observation balloons were the most beautiful things he ever expected to see. And I now compare his elation over arcs and spirals and splotches in the atmosphere with what Jackson Pollock used to feel as he watched what dribbled paint chose to do when it struck a canvas on his studio floor.\nSame sort of happiness!\nExcept that what Pollock did lacked that greatest of all crowd pleasers, which was human sacrifice.\nBut my point about Fred Jones is this: he had found a home in the Air Corps, just as I would find a home in the Corps of Engineers.\nAnd then he was kicked out for the same reason that I was: he had lost an eye somewhere.\nSo there is something startling I might tell myself as a youth, if I could get back to the Great Depression in a time machine: \u201cPst\u2014you, the cocky little Armenian kid. Yes, you. You think Fred Jones is funny and sad at the same time? That\u2019s what you\u2019ll be someday, too: a one-eyed old soldier, afraid of women and with no talent for civilian life.\u201d", 0.14587173579109064], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "palm-sunday":

She took no notice, busily upbraiding in her mind the insensitive men and women in the railroad station. The ambulance had taken the old man away, and now Ruth, having missed her train, had four more hours to spend in Ted\u2019s hometown.\n\u201cJust because he was ugly and dirty, you wouldn\u2019t help him,\u201d she told the imagined crowd. \u201cHe was sick and needed help, and you all went your selfish ways rather than touch him. Shame on you.\u201d She looked challengingly at persons coming down the sidewalk toward her, and had her look returned with puzzlement. \u201cYou\u2019d pretend there was nothing serious wrong with him,\u201d she murmured.\nRuth killed time in a woman\u2019s way, pretending to be on a shopping errand. She looked critically at window displays, fingered fabrics, priced articles, and promised salesgirls she would be back to buy after looking in one or two more shops. Her activity was almost fully automatic, leaving her thoughts to go their righteous, self-congratulatory way. She was one of the few, she told herself, who did not run away from the untouchables, from unclean, sick strangers.\nIt was a buoyant thought, and Ruth let herself believe that Ted was sharing it with her. With the thought of Ted came the image of his formidable mother. The buoyance grew as Ruth saw how selfish Mrs. Faulkner was by comparison. The older woman would have sat in the waiting room oblivious to everything but the tragedy in her own narrow life. She would have muttered to a ghost while the old man hacked his life away.\nRuth relived her bitter, humiliating few hours with the woman, the bullying and wheedling in the name of a nightmarish notion of motherhood and an armful of trinkets. Disgust and the urge to get away came back full strength. Ruth leaned against a jewelry counter, and came face-to-face with herself in a mirror.\n\u201cCan I help you, madam?\u201d said a salesgirl.\n\u201cWhat? Oh\u2014no, thank you,\u201d said Ruth. The face in the mirror was vindictive, smug. The eyes had the same cold glaze as the eyes that had looked at the old man in the station and seen nothing.\n\u201cYou look a little ill. Would you like to sit down for a moment?\u201d\n\u201cNo, really\u2014there\u2019s nothing wrong,\u201d said Ruth absently.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a doctor on duty in the store.\u201d", -0.1076202876984127], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["hate", 0.17647058823529413], ["brown", 0.11764705882352941], ["bobby", 0.11764705882352941], ["touch", 0.11764705882352941], ["sister", 0.058823529411764705], ["pardon", 0.058823529411764705], ["flesh", 0.058823529411764705], ["arms", 0.058823529411764705], ["queerly", 0.058823529411764705], ["course", 0.058823529411764705], ["paralyzed", 0.058823529411764705], ["time", 0.058823529411764705]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThank you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cTouch me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPardon me?\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2019m your own flesh.

But I ain\u2019t got the repertory for that. I\u2019m over my head, and you can\u2019t pick up in the middle of the classics. And you play hell building a repertory of that stuff, when you gotta wait sometimes a year, two years, to see the thing twice.\u201d He rubbed his eyes, as though remembering hours of concentration before a video screen. \u201cYou gotta see \u2019em plugged and plugged and plugged.

about. I kept on going because my mind was swamped with much deeper reasons for unhappiness. My wife had moved herself and the kids from Fort Bragg to Baltimore, where she was going to study Physical Therapy at Johns Hopkins University. Her recently widowed mother had moved in with them. Margaret and Mildred had bought a house in Baltimore with money left to them by my father-in-law. It was their house, not mine. I didn\u2019t know anybody in Baltimore.\nWhat the heck was I supposed to do in Baltimore? It was exactly as though I had been killed in Vietnam, and now Margaret had to make a new life for herself. And I was a freak to my own children. They, too, looked at me as though I were wearing nothing but a black garterbelt.\nAnd wouldn\u2019t my wife and kids be proud of me when I told them that I hadn\u2019t been able to answer more than a quarter of the questions on the examination for admission to graduate studies in Physics at MIT?\nWelcome home!\nAs I was about to go into the Chinese restaurant, two pretty girls came out. They, too, showed contempt for me and my haircut and my uniform. So I said to them, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Haven\u2019t you ever before seen a man wearing nothing but a black garterbelt?\u201d\nBLACK GARTERBELTS WERE on my mind, I suppose, because I missed Jack Patton so much. I had survived the war, but he hadn\u2019t, and the present he sent me only a few days before he was shot dead, as I said before, was a skin magazine called Black Garterbelt.\nSo there we were in that restaurant, with me on my third Sweet Rob Roy. Margaret and her mother, again acting as though I were 6 feet under in Arlington National Cemetery, did all the ordering. They had it served family style. Nobody asked me how I had done on the exam. Nobody asked me what it was like to be home from the war.\nThe others gabbled on to each other about all the tourist sights they had seen that day. They hadn\u2019t come along to keep me company and give me moral support. They were there to see \u201cOld Ironsides\u201d and the belfry where Paul Revere had waved the lantern, signaling that the British were coming by land, and so on.\nYes, and, speaking of belfries, it was on this same enchanted evening that I was told that my wife, the mother of my children, had a remarkable number of ancestors and collateral relatives with bats in their belfries on her mother\u2019s side. This was news to me, and to Margaret, too. We knew that Mildred had grown up in Peru, Indiana. But all she had ever said about Peru was that Cole Porter had been born there, too, and that she had been very glad to get out of there.\nMildred had let us know that her childhood had been unhappy, but that was a long way from saying that she, which meant my wife and kids, too, was from a notorious family of loonies there.", 0.13165748393021126], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box":

"sentiment": ["During the Great Depression, Nathan Durant was homeless until he found a home in the United States Army. He spent seventeen years in the Army, thinking of the earth as terrain, of the hills and valleys as enfilade and defilade, of the horizon as something a man should never silhouette himself against, of the houses and woods and thickets as cover. It was a good life, and when he-got tired of thinking about war, he got himself a girl and a bottle, and the next morning he was ready to think about war some more.\nWhen he was thirty-six, an enemy projectile dropped into a command post under thick green cover in defilade in the terrain of Korea, and blew Major Durant, his maps, and his career through the wall of his tent.\nHe had always assumed that he was going to die young and gallantly. But he didn\u2019t die. Death was far, far away, and Durant faced unfamiliar and frightening battalions of peaceful years.\nIn the hospital, the man in the next bed talked constantly of the boat he was going to own when he was whole again. For want of exciting peacetime dreams of his own, for want of a home or family or civilian friends, Durant borrowed his neighbor\u2019s dream.\nWith a deep scar across his cheek, with the lobe of his right ear gone, with a stiff leg, he limped into a boatyard in New London, the port nearest the hospital, and bought a secondhand cabin cruiser. He learned to run it in the harbor there, christened the boat The Jolly Roger at the suggestion of some children who haunted the boatyard, and set out arbitrarily for Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\nHe stayed on the island but a day, depressed by the tranquility and permanence, by the feeling of deep, still lakes of time, by men and women so at one with the peace of the place as to have nothing to exchange with an old soldier but a few words about the weather.\nDurant fled to Chatham, at the elbow of Cape Cod, and found himself beside a beautiful woman at the foot of a lighthouse there. Had he been in his old uniform, seeming as he\u2019d liked to seem in the old days, about to leave on a dangerous mission, he and the woman might have strolled off together. Women had once treated him like a small boy with special permission to eat icing off cakes. But the woman looked away without interest. He was nobody and nothing. The spark was gone.\nHis former swashbuckling spirits returned for an hour or two during a brief blow off the dunes of Cape Cod\u2019s east coast, but there was no one aboard to notice. When he reached the sheltered harbor at Provincetown and went ashore, he was a hollow man again, who didn\u2019t have to be anywhere at any time, whose life was all behind him.\n\u201cLook up, please,\u201d commanded a gaudily dressed young man with a camera in his hands and a girl on his arm.\nSurprised, Durant did look up, and the camera shutter clicked. \u201cThank you,\u201d said the young man brightly.", 0.1017207792207792], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["valentine", 0.0472972972972973], ["francine", 0.04054054054054054], ["dwayne", 0.033783783783783786], ["trout", 0.033783783783783786], ["attention", 0.033783783783783786], ["ralston", 0.02702702702702703], ["jimmy", 0.02702702702702703], ["clitoris", 0.02702702702702703], ["safe", 0.02027027027027027], ["books", 0.02027027027027027], ["kilgore", 0.02027027027027027], ["love", 0.02027027027027027], ["women", 0.02027027027027027], ["pay", 0.02027027027027027], ["famous", 0.013513513513513514], ["wrote", 0.013513513513513514], ["fingertips", 0.013513513513513514], ["son", 0.013513513513513514], ["motor", 0.013513513513513514], ["wanted", 0.013513513513513514], ["quality", 0.013513513513513514], ["paying", 0.013513513513513514], ["cracker", 0.013513513513513514], ["bed", 0.013513513513513514], ["court", 0.013513513513513514], ["writer", 0.013513513513513514], ["person", 0.013513513513513514], ["sandpapered", 0.013513513513513514], ["extrasensitive", 0.006756756756756757], ["votes", 0.006756756756756757], ["danger", 0.006756756756756757], ["better", 0.006756756756756757], ["touched", 0.006756756756756757], ["thousands", 0.006756756756756757], ["good", 0.006756756756756757], ["read", 0.006756756756756757], ["touching", 0.006756756756756757], ["fall", 0.006756756756756757], ["day", 0.006756756756756757], ["fortune", 0.006756756756756757], ["told", 0.006756756756756757], ["second", 0.006756756756756757], ["lovers", 0.006756756756756757], ["driving", 0.006756756756756757], ["tens", 0.006756756756756757], ["surprise", 0.006756756756756757], ["body", 0.006756756756756757], ["men", 0.006756756756756757], ["hero", 0.006756756756756757], ["water", 0.006756756756756757], ["invented", 0.006756756756756757], ["amount", 0.006756756756756757], ["afternoon", 0.006756756756756757], ["suggestion", 0.006756756756756757], ["named", 0.006756756756756757], ["point", 0.006756756756756757], ["feel", 0.006756756756756757], ["darlene", 0.006756756756756757], ["wasn", 0.006756756756756757], ["open", 0.006756756756756757], ["story", 0.006756756756756757], ["tumblers", 0.006756756756756757], ["lot", 0.006756756756756757], ["exactly", 0.006756756756756757], ["understand", 0.006756756756756757], ["novel", 0.006756756756756757], ["abandoned", 0.006756756756756757], ["dirty", 0.006756756756756757], ["making", 0.006756756756756757], ["feeling", 0.006756756756756757], ["beautiful", 0.006756756756756757], ["hoping", 0.006756756756756757], ["supposed", 0.006756756756756757], ["states", 0.006756756756756757], ["sense", 0.006756756756756757], ["united", 0.006756756756756757], ["seduce", 0.006756756756756757], ["things", 0.006756756756756757], ["stayed", 0.006756756756756757], ["book", 0.006756756756756757], ["felt", 0.006756756756756757], ["husbands", 0.006756756756756757], ["delicate", 0.006756756756756757], ["president", 0.006756756756756757], ["response", 0.006756756756756757], ["man", 0.006756756756756757], ["short", 0.006756756756756757], ["wife", 0.006756756756756757], ["slaves", 0.006756756756756757], ["tense", 0.006756756756756757]], "sentiment": ["Men were supposed to pay more attention to the clitoris, and Dwayne had been paying a lot more attention to Francine\u2019s, to the point where she said he was paying too much attention to it. This did not surprise him. The things he had read about the clitoris had said that this was a danger\u2014that a man could pay too much attention to it.\nSo, driving out to the Quality Motor Court that day, Dwayne was hoping that he would pay exactly the right amount of attention to Francine\u2019s clitoris.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nKilgore Trout once wrote a short novel about the importance of the clitoris in love-making. This was in response to a suggestion by his second wife, Darlene, that he could make a fortune with a dirty book. She told him that the hero should understand women so well that he could seduce anyone he wanted. So Trout wrote The Son of Jimmy Valentine.\nJimmy Valentine was a famous made-up person in another writer\u2019s books, just as Kilgore Trout was a famous made-up person in my books. Jimmy Valentine in the other writer\u2019s books sandpapered his fingertips, so they were extrasensitive. He was a safe-cracker. His sense of feel was so delicate that he could open any safe in the world by feeling the tumblers fall.\nKilgore Trout invented a son for Jimmy Valentine, named Ralston Valentine. Ralston Valentine also sandpapered his fingertips. But he wasn\u2019t a safe-cracker. Ralston was so good at touching women the way they wanted to be touched, that tens of thousands of them became his willing slaves.

It slithered along the bleached floorboards, coming to rest in a dark corner. \u201cPut your hands up, Sammy,\u201d he said. He held his hands over his head, his back to me, facing the hallway down which the Russians were stomping. \u201cI must of been crazy drunk, Sammy.

Neither one smiled. \u201cPut your hands up!\u201d commanded one in German.\n\u201cAmerikaner,\u201d I said weakly, and I put my hands up.\nThe two looked surprised, and began consulting in whispers, never taking their eyes off us. They scowled at first, but became more and more jovial as they talked, until they were at last beaming at us. I guess they had had to reassure each other that it was right in line with policy to be friendly with Americans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the people,\u201d said the one who could speak German, gravely.\n\u201cA great day,\u201d I agreed. \u201cGeorge, give the boys a drink.\u201d\nThey looked happily at the bottle, and rocked back and forth on their feet, nodding and snickering. They insisted politely that George take the first drink to the great day for the people. George grinned nervously. The bottle was almost to his lips before it slipped from his fingers to bang on the floor, spewing its contents over our feet.", 0.1814649470899471], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
