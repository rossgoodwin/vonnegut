This surely constitutes a rejection. Would you kindly return the manuscript to me at the earliest possible convenience.\nI realize that you are in the position of trying to protect an investment of several hundred dollars. However, the best chance for you to recover that money, it seems to me, is to let me submit the novel elsewhere. You would share in the advance, if any. I think I could talk a paperback house into an advance that would make us both happy.\nYours truly,\nKurt Vonnegut, Jr.\nUndated, marked Summer, 1959\n[West Barnstable, MA]\nTO KNOX BURGER\nKnox had suggested in 1957 that Kurt write a science-fiction novel for his new line of mass-market paperback originals, and Kurt revived the idea for The Sirens of Titan; it was published in 1959. Dell published 177,500 in its first printing, though the few reviews dismissed it as science fiction. It later became popular with college students during the sixties. (In 1961 it was issued in hardcover by Houghton Mifflin.) After Slaughterhouse-Five made Vonnegut famous, Sirens reached an even wider audience.\nDear Knox:", 0.34188311688311684], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["trout", 0.01702127659574468],

van Gogh?\u201d he asked. And I had better explain that the real Vincent van Gogh was a Dutchman who painted in the south of France, whose pictures are now numbered among the world\u2019s most precious treasures, but who in his own lifetime sold only two of them. \u201cIt isn\u2019t only because he, like me, took no pride in his appearance and disgusted women, although that surely has to be factored in,\u201d said Trout.\n\u201cThe main thing about van Gogh and me,\u201d said Trout, \u201cis that he painted pictures that astonished him with their importance, even though nobody else thought they were worth a damn, and I write stories that astonish me, even though nobody else thinks they\u2019re worth a damn.\n\u201cHow lucky can you get?\u201d\nTrout was the only appreciative audience he needed for what he was and did. That let him accept the conditions of the rerun as unsurprising. It was just more foolishness in the world outside his own, and no more worthy of his respect than wars or economic collapses or plagues, or tidal waves, or TV stars, or what you will.\nHe was capable of being such a rational hero in the neighborhood of the Academy the instant free will kicked in again, because, in my opinion, Trout, unlike most of the rest of us, had found no significant differences between life as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and life as original material.\nAs for how little he was affected by the rerun, as compared with the hell it had been for most of the rest of us, he wrote in My Ten Years on Automatic Pilot: \u201cI didn\u2019t need a timequake to teach me being alive was a crock of shit. I already knew that from my childhood and crucifixes and history books.\u201d\nFor the record: Dr. Fleon Sunoco at the NIH, who is independently rich, hires grave robbers to bring him the brains of deceased members of Mensa, a nationwide club for persons with high Intelligence Quotients, or IQs, as determined by standardized tests of verbal and nonverbal skills, tests which pit the testees against the Joe and Jane Sixpacks, against the Lumpenproletariat.\nHis ghouls also bring him brains of people who died in really stupid accidents, crossing busy streets against the light, starting charcoal fires at cookouts with gasoline, and so on, for comparison. So as not to arouse suspicion, they deliver the fresh brains one at a time in buckets stolen from a nearby Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. Needless to say, Sunoco\u2019s supervisors have no idea what he\u2019s really doing when he works late night after night.\nThey do notice how much he likes fried chicken, apparently, ordering it by the bucket, and that he never offers anybody else some. They also wonder how he stays so skinny.

She said, \u201cGesundheit!\u201d\nYes, and after being discharged from Caldwell for the second time, Gil Berman made up several jokes about sobriety. He called it \u201cthe drug of choice for kindergarten through the first six grades.\u201d He said, \u201cSobriety is ten times more hallucinogenic than LSD or angel dust. If you haven\u2019t taken a trip on sobriety, or as they call it on the street, \u2018cold turkey,\u2019 you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d And he was so curious about what sobriety was doing to him that it might have been a famous drug he hadn\u2019t tried yet, like \u201croofies,\u201d say, the so-called \u201cdate-rape drug.\u201d\nHe had a joke about roofies: \u201cLips that touch roofies will never touch mine.\u201d He compared his detoxed self with what he had been when he made Who\u2019s Sorry Now? That CD\u2019s opening lines were these: \u201cListen: If there was ever a man who should never have been a husband, that\u2019s me. If there was ever a man who should never have been a father, that\u2019s me. If there was ever a man who should never have even been alive, that\u2019s the boozehound and coke-head who\u2019s here tonight to sell you on the many delights of de-destruction.\u201d\nThat pre\u2013Taj Mahal Gil Berman ranted on from there, interrupting himself again and again with guffaws of agony, to tell of the violence that had ended his first and only marriage and that had caused him to be jailed and separated from his then-pregnant wife for what he thought would be forever. He did not mention on the CD that the wife he slugged in the jaw was gravid, or that he\u2019d wanted her to get an abortion. But he did say how pitiful she looked after he knocked her down. And sober Berman found himself now wondering, as so many critics had when the disc was released, how anyone could find that part of it funny.\nWhen he recorded it, and was on snorted speed, he had thought himself hilarious. He now wondered if the CD\u2019s popularity, in any case limited to persons his own age and younger, hadn\u2019t been engendered by morbid fascination with such a grotesque act of self-crucifixion.\nNo such yowling atonement, or even a mild admission of guilt of any sort, had so far been part of what had come pouring out of him since his second discharge from Caldwell, the stuff he was now trying out before a live audience for the fifth time there in Northampton. It seemed to Gil Berman that drug-free Gil Berman was much more at peace with himself, as though he had settled whatever problem or problems had made him so desperate in Who\u2019s Sorry Now? He was familiar, as are all graduates of Caldwell, with this adage: that the problem in the life of an alcoholic is alcohol, and that the problem in the life of a drug abuser is drugs. Up to now, Berman had found this truism more of value to therapists than to patients. It gave therapists the simplest specifications for what they could call a cure. But Gil Berman, watching drug-free Gil Berman like a hawk, found him unimpaired as a wit and scourge of every sort of institutional stupidity and hypocrisy that was murdering not just common decency, but the planet itself.\nWhat was lost? Self-pity. Another poignant line not original with Gil Berman: \u201cGood riddance of bad rubbish.\u201d\nYou bet! And drug-free Gil Berman was still saying, in one way or another, because it had to be said, what in Who\u2019s Sorry Now? had provoked such pro forma outrage on the part of what he called \u201cmilitant ostriches fighting the War on Drugs.\u201d He was still saying that drugs, over-the-counter, prescribed, or against the law, were as pervasive in modern America as cars or TVs\u2014\u201cor, for that matter, Kleenex and toilet paper\u201d\u2014and as potentially beneficial. Drug-free Gil Berman was still saying that the government, instead of fighting \u201cKeystone Cops battles\u201d against popular drugs outlawed at random, should be teaching Americans about all of them and admit that most, but certainly not all, if used in moderation, could be \u201csort of life-enhancing, like Kleenex or toilet paper.\u201d\nFrom Who\u2019s Sorry Now?: \u201cPlease join me in my war on Bayer Aspirin and Phillips\u2019 Milk of Magnesia. Call out the Eighty-second Airborne! Aspirin makes the lining of my stomach bleed, and milk of magnesia makes me shit my brains out. And the only reason I\u2019m not at war with General Motors is that state and local governments make sure people know how to drive a fucking Pontiac Trans-Am. Otherwise, I\u2019d say let\u2019s do to Detroit what we did to North Vietnam with such satisfying results, which is bomb it back to the Stone Age.\u201d\nMuch of what Gil Berman tried out in Northampton in 2000 would be part of his CD If God Were Alive Today, put on sale in April of the year 2003. A few of those bits, all by themselves, including the one about artificial intelligences gossiping to each other about human beings, would be played at his memorial service at The Players, his club in New York City, in November of that year.", 0.01824635867604618], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["yank", 0.17647058823529413], ["sir", 0.11764705882352941], ["billy", 0.11764705882352941], ["englishman", 0.058823529411764705], ["thing", 0.058823529411764705], ["coat", 0.058823529411764705], ["hard", 0.058823529411764705], ["jerry", 0.058823529411764705], ["insult", 0.058823529411764705], ["questions", 0.058823529411764705], ["fatiguing", 0.058823529411764705], ["ohhhh", 0.058823529411764705], ["germans", 0.058823529411764705]], "sentiment": ["\u201cSir?\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you get such a thing?\u201d\nBilly had to think hard about that. \u201cThey gave it to me,\u201d he said at last.\n\u201cJerry gave it to you?\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cThe Germans gave it to you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nBilly didn\u2019t like the questions.

You, apparently, were giving away oil wells last night, and the lawyer was thoughtful enough to draw up documents which, if signed by you, would be binding. They were signed by you. You gave away five hundred and thirty-one producing oil wells last night, which wiped out Fandango Petroleum.\n\"At eleven,\" said Fern, \"the President of the United States announced that Galactic Spacecraft, which we had sold, was receiving a three-billion contract for the New Age of Space.\n\"At eleven-thirty,\" said Fern, \"I was given a copy of The Journal of the American Medical Association, which was marked by our public relations director, \u2019FYI.\u2019 These three letters, as you would know if you had ever spent any time in your office, mean \u2019for your information.\u2019 I turned to the page referred to, and learned, for my information, that MoonMist Cigarettes were not a cause but the principal cause of sterility in both sexes wherever MoonMist cigarettes were sold. This fact was discovered not by human beings but by a computing machine. Whenever data about cigarette smoking was fed into it, the machine grew tremendously excited, and no one could figure out why. The machine was obviously trying to tell its operators something. It did everything it could to express itself, and finally managed to get its operators to ask it the right questions.\n\"The right questions had to do with the relationship of MoonMist Cigarettes to human reproduction. The relationship was this:\n\"People who smoked MoonMist Cigarettes couldn\u2019t have children, even if they wanted them,\" said Fern.\n\"Doubtless,\" said Fern, \"there are gigolos and party girls and New Yorkers who are grateful for this relief from biology. In the opinion of the Legal Department of Magnum Opus, before that department was liquidated, however, there are several million persons who can sue successfully\u2014on the grounds that MoonMist Cigarettes did them out of something rather valuable.

I was delighted to join the Army and go to war. After the war, I went to the University of Chicago, where I was pleased to study anthropology, a science that was mostly poetry, that involved almost no math at all. I was married by then, and soon had one kid, who was Mark. He would later go crazy, of course, and write a fine book about it\u2014The Eden Express. He has just fathered a kid himself, my first grandchild, a boy named Zachary. Mark is finishing his second year in Harvard Medical School, and will be about the only member of his class not to be in debt when he graduates\u2014because of the book. That\u2019s a pretty decent recovery from a crackup, I\u2019d say.\nINTERVIEWER: Did the study of anthropology later color your writings?\nVONNEGUT: It confirmed my atheism, which was the faith of my fathers anyway. Religions were exhibited and studied as the Rube Goldberg inventions I\u2019d always thought they were. We weren\u2019t allowed to find one culture superior to any other. We caught hell if we mentioned races much. It was highly idealistic.\nINTERVIEWER: Almost a religion?\nVONNEGUT: Exactly. And the only one for me. So far.\nINTERVIEWER: What was your dissertation?\nVONNEGUT: Cat\u2019s Cradle.\nINTERVIEWER: But you wrote that years after you left Chicago, didn\u2019t you?\nVONNEGUT: I left Chicago without writing a dissertation\u2014 and without a degree. All my ideas for dissertations had been rejected, and I was broke, so I took a job as a P.R. man for General Electric in Schenectady. Twenty years later, I got a letter from a new dean at Chicago, who had been looking through my dossier. Under the rules of the university, he said, a published work of high quality could be substituted for a dissertation, so I was entitled to an M.A. He had shown Cat\u2019s Cradle to the Anthropology Department, and they had said it was halfway decent anthropology, so they were mailing me my degree.

and the only faculty member who had medals from the Vietnam War. When it comes right down to it, that is why they fired me, although I don\u2019t believe they themselves realized that that was why they fired me: I had ugly, personal knowledge of the disgrace that was the Vietnam War.\nNone of the Trustees had been in that war, and neither had Kimberley\u2019s father, and not one of them had allowed a son or a daughter to be sent over there. Across the lake in the prison, of course, and down in the town, there were plenty of somebody\u2019s sons who had been sent over there.\n12\nI MET JUST 2 people when I crossed the Quadrangle to Samoza Hall. One was Professor Marilyn Shaw, head of the Department of Life Sciences. She was the only other faculty member who had served in Vietnam. She had been a nurse. The other was Norman Everett, an old campus gardener like my grandfather. He had a son who had been paralyzed from the waist down by a mine in Vietnam and was a permanent resident in a Veterans Administration hospital over in Schenectady.\nThe seniors and their families and the rest of the faculty were having lunch in the Pavilion. Everybody got a lobster which had been boiled alive.\nI NEVER CONSIDERED making a pass at Marilyn, although she was reasonably attractive and unattached. I don\u2019t know why that is. There may have been some sort of incest taboo operating, as though we were brother and sister, since we had both been in Vietnam.\nShe is dead now, buried next to the stable, in the shadow of Musket Mountain when the Sun goes down. She was evidently hit by a stray bullet. Who in his right mind would have taken dead aim at her?\nRemembering her now, I wonder if I wasn\u2019t in love with her, even though we avoided talking to each other as much as possible.\nMAYBE I SHOULD put her on a very short list indeed: all the women I loved. That would be Marilyn, I think, and Margaret during the first 4 years or so of our marriage, before I came home with the clap. I was also very fond of Harriet Gummer, the war correspondent for The Des Moines Register, who, it turns out, bore me a son after our love affair in Manila. I think I felt what could be called love for Zuzu Johnson, whose husband was crucified.

at my wrist to see what time it was. And then I recalled that I no longer owned a watch. The man in the bunk overhead was also astir. I asked him for the time. He stuck his head over the side, and I saw that his jaws were crammed with bread; he blew a shower of crumbs over me as he answered. He said he no longer had a watch. He chewed and swallowed until a major portion of the great wad of bread was cleared from his mouth and he could make himself understood. \u201cI should care what time it is when Louis will give me two loaves and ten cigarettes for a watch that wasn\u2019t worth twenty dollars new?\u201d he asked.\nLouis had a monopoly on rapport with the guards. His avowed harmony with Nazi principles convinced our keepers that he was the only bright one among us, and we all had to do our Black-Marketeering through this superficial Judas. Six weeks after we had been quartered in Dresden, nobody had any way of knowing what time it was outside of Louis and the guards. Two weeks after that, Louis had done every married man out of his wedding ring with this argument: \u201cO.K., go ahead and be sentimental, go ahead and starve to death. Love\u2019s a wonderful thing, they tell me.\u201d\nHis profits were enormous. I later found out that my watch, for instance, brought a price of one hundred cigarettes and six loaves of bread. Anyone familiar with starvation will recognize that this was a handsome prize. Louis converted most of his wealth into the most negotiable of all securities, cigarettes. And it wasn\u2019t long before the possibilities of being a loan shark had occurred to him. Once every two weeks we were issued twenty cigarettes. Slaves of the tobacco habit would exhaust the ration in one or two days, and would be in a state of frenzy until the next ration came. Louis, who was coming to be known as \u201cThe People\u2019s Friend\u201d or \u201cHonest John,\u201d announced that cigarettes might be borrowed from him at a reasonable fifty-percent interest until the next ration. He soon had his wealth loaned out and increasing by half every two weeks. I was terribly in debt to him, with nothing left for collateral but my soul. I took him to task for his greed: \u201cChrist drove the moneylenders from the temple,\u201d I reminded him.\n\u201cThat was money they were lending, my boy,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m not beggin\u2019 you to borrow my cigarettes, am I? You\u2019re beggin\u2019 me to lend you some. Cigarettes are luxuries, friend. You don\u2019t have to smoke to stay alive. You\u2019d probably live longer if you didn\u2019t smoke. Why don\u2019t you give up the filthy habit?\u201d\n\u201cHow many can you let me have until next Tuesday?\u201d I asked.\nWhen usury had swelled his hoard to an all-time high, a catastrophe, which he had been awaiting impatiently, caused the value of his cigarettes to sky-rocket. The USAAF swept over the feeble Dresden defenses to demolish, among other things, the major cigarette factories. As a consequence, not only the P.W. cigarette ration, but that of the guards and civilians as well, was cut off completely. Louis was a major figure in local finance. The guards found themselves without a smoke to their names, and began selling our rings and watches back to Louis at a lower price than they had given him. Some put his wealth as high as one hundred watches. Louis\u2019 own estimate, however, was a modest fifty-three watches, seventeen wedding rings, seven high school rings, and an heirloom watch-fob. \u201cSome of the watches need a lot of work done on them,\u201d he told me.\nWhen I say that the AAF got the cigarette factories among other things, I mean that a number of human beings got blown up as well\u2014something like 200,000. Our activities took a ghoulish turn. We were put to work exhuming the dead from their innumerable crypts. Many of them wore jewelry, and most had carried their precious belongings to the shelters. At first we shunned the grave goods. For one thing, some of us felt that stripping corpses was a revolting business, and for another, to be caught at it was certain death. It took Louis to bring us to our senses. \u201cGood God, kid, you could make enough to retire on in fifteen minutes. I just wish they\u2019d let me go out with you guys for just a day.\u201d He licked his lips, and continued: \u201cTell you what\u2014I\u2019ll really make it worth your while. You get me one good diamond ring, and I\u2019ll keep you in smokes and chow for as long as we\u2019re in this hole.\u201d\nThe next evening I brought him his ring, tucked into my trouser cuff. So, it turned out, did everyone else. When I showed him the diamond he shook his head. \u201cOh, what a dirty shame,\u201d he said. He held the stone up to a light: \u201cHere the poor kid risked his life for a zircon!\u201d Everybody, a minute inspection revealed, had brought back either a zircon, a garnet, or a paste diamond. In addition, Louis pointed out, any slight value these might have was destroyed because of a glutted market. I let my plunder go for four cigarettes; others got a bit of cheese, a few hundred grams of bread, or twenty potatoes. Some hung on to their gems. Louis chatted with them from time to time about the dangers of being caught with loot. \u201cPoor devil over at the British Compound got it today,\u201d he would say. \u201cThey caught him with a pearl necklace sewed into his shirt. It only took \u2019em two hours to try him and shoot him.\u201d Sooner or later everyone made a deal with Louis.\nShortly after the last of us had been cleaned out, the S.S. came through our quarters on a surprise inspection. Louis\u2019 bed was the only one undisturbed. \u201cHe never leaves the compound and is a perfect prisoner,\u201d a guard was quick to explain to the inspectors. My mattress was slashed open and the straw scattered over the floor when I came home that evening.", 0.09699519658423769], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
