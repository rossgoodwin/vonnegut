Some pain inside of him made him wince, then made him hunch over, close his eyes\u2014made him concentrate on surviving the pain.\nFrank Hoenikker went to his support, feebly, incompetently. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d \u201cPapa\u201d whispered at last, straightening up some. There were tears in his eyes. He brushed them away, straightening up all the way. \u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d\nHe seemed to be in doubt for a moment as to where he was, as to what was expected of him. And then he remembered. He shook Horlick Minton\u2019s hand. \u201cHere, you are among friends.\u201d", 0.14331300013118195], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["paul", 0.055299539170506916], ["garth",

rod and began swabbing the bore again. \u201cPaul\u2014Pittsburgh is still open. The field has been narrowed down to two men.\u201d\nIt was somewhat startling that he said it just that way, the way Anita had said he would. He wondered what it was she thought he should say in response. He\u2019d never given her a chance to say, and hadn\u2019t read the outline. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful chance to be of real service,\u201d he said. He supposed that was pretty close to what she had in mind.\nPaul felt lightheaded, having borrowed Anita\u2019s thoughts for want of enthusiasm of his own. He was being offered the Pittsburgh job, lots more money, and, since he would have risen so high with the greater portion of his life still ahead, the assurance that he would almost certainly go clear to the top. The moment of his arrival at this point of immense good fortune was curiously bland. He had known it was coming for a long time. Kroner had wanted it for him and had come close to promising it to him often\u2014always in the name of his father. When advances had come, as now, there had been a vestigal sort of ritual of surprise and congratulation, as though Paul, like his ancestors, had arrived by cunning, tenacity, and God\u2019s will or the Devil\u2019s laxness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough decision, Paul, between you and Fred Garth.\u201d Garth was a much older man, nearly Kroner\u2019s age, manager of the Buffalo Works. \u201cFrankly, Garth hasn\u2019t got your technical imagination, Paul. As a manager he\u2019s excellent, but if it wasn\u2019t for prodding, the Buffalo Works would be just as it was when he took over five years ago. But he\u2019s steady and reliable, Paul, and there\u2019s never been any question that he was one of us, that he put progress and the system ahead of his own interests.\u201d\n\u201cGarth\u2019s a fine man,\u201d said Paul. Garth was, too: foursquare, desperate to please, and he seemed to have an anthropomorphic image of the corporate personality. Garth stood in relation to that image as a lover, and Paul wondered if this prevalent type of relationship had ever been given the consideration it deserved by sexologists. On second thought, he supposed that it had\u2014the general phenomenon of a lover\u2019s devotion to the unseen\u2014in studies of nuns\u2019 symbolic marriages to Christ. At any rate, Paul had seen Garth at various stages of his love affair, unable to eat for anxiety, on a manic crest, moved to maudlin near-crying at recollections of the affair\u2019s tender beginnings.

And Mary said that she might as well go back up into the crow\u2019s nest, to see what she could see.\nBefore she went up there, though, she had one more barb for the Captain. She asked him to name the island she might expect to see very soon. This was something he had done all through the third day at sea, naming islands which were just below the horizon and dead ahead, supposedly. \u201cKeep your eyes peeled for San Crist\u00f3bal, or maybe Genovesa\u2014depending on how far south we are,\u201d he had said, or, later in the day, \u201cAh!

They have wingspreads as great as two meters, and remain as committed as ever to the future of aviation. They still think it\u2019s the coming thing.\nAs the fifth day drew to a close, though, the Captain remained silent when Mary asked him to name any island he believed to be nearby.\nSo she asked him again, and he told her this: \u201cMount Ararat.\u201d\nWhen she got up into the crow\u2019s nest, though, I was surprised that she did not cry out in wonderment at what I mistook for a very queer weather phenomenon taking place right over the stern of the ship, and then trailing aft\u2014over the wake. It seemed electrical in nature, although very silent, a close relative of ball lightning, maybe, or Saint Elmo\u2019s fire.\nThat former high school teacher looked right at it, but gave no sign that she found it at all out of the ordinary.

Each show can feature an otherwise healthy family, from which a single life-sustaining element has been withheld. We might begin with the Watson family, which has everything but water. But no family could survive an entire television season without water, so we had better give the Watsons a diet absolutely devoid of Vitamin B complex, instead.\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t tell the audience or the critics or the Watsons what was really wrong with the Watsons. We would pretend to be as puzzled as anybody about why they weren\u2019t happier with their quadraphonic sound system and their tap dancing lessons and their Pontiac Ventura and all. We would take part in symposia with ministers and sociologists, and so forth, reaching no firm conclusions\u2014while the Watsons slowly died of beriberi.\n\u201cA microscopic quantity of vitamins could save the Watsons. But a ton of Billy Grahams couldn\u2019t save the Louds. They know too much.\n\u201cNow is as good a time as any to mention White House prayer breakfasts, I guess. I think we all know now that religion of that sort is about as nourishing to the human spirit as potassium cyanide. We have been experimenting with it. Every guinea pig died. We are up to our necks in dead guinea pigs.\n\u201cThe lethal ingredient in those breakfasts wasn\u2019t prayer. And it wasn\u2019t the eggs or the orange juice or the hominy grits. It was a virulent new strain of hypocrisy which did everyone in.\n\u201cTalk about typhoid Mary!\n\u201cIf I have offended anyone here by talking of the need of a new religion, I apologize. I am willing to drop the word religion, and substitute for it these three words: heartfelt moral code. We sure need such a thing, and it should be simple enough and reasonable enough for anyone to understand. The trouble with so many of the moral codes we have inherited is that they are subject to so many interpretations. We require specialists, historians and archaeologists and linguists and so on, to tell us where this or that idea may have come from, to suggest what this or that statement might actually mean. This is good news for hypocrites, who enjoy feeling pious, no matter what they do.\n\u201cIf we were to try to grow recent strains of hypocrisy in the laboratory, what would we grow them in? I think they would grow like Jack\u2019s beanstalk in a mulch of ancient moral codes.\n\u201cIt may be that moral simplicity is not possible in modern times. It may be that simplicity and clarity can come only from a new messiah, who may never come. We can talk about portents, if you like. I like a good portent as much as anyone. What might be the meaning of the comet Kahoutek, which was to make us look upward, to impress us with the paltriness of our troubles, to cleanse our souls with cosmic awe? Kahoutek was a fizzle, and what might this fizzle mean?\n\u201cI take it to mean that we can expect no spectacular miracles from the heavens, that the problems of ordinary human beings will have to be solved by ordinary human beings. The message of Kahoutek is: \u2019Help is not on the way.

father\u2019s mood after he was let go by Barrytron, and he went on a cruise down the Inland Waterway on the East Coast, from City Island in New York City to Palm Beach, Florida. This was on a motor yacht owned by his old college roommate, a man named Fred Handy. Handy had also studied chemical engineering, but then had gone into junk bonds instead. He heard that Father was deeply depressed. He thought the cruise might cheer Dad up.\nBut all the way to Palm Beach, where Handy had a waterfront estate, down the East River, down Barnegat Bay, up Delaware Bay and down Chesapeake Bay, down the Dismal Swamp Canal, and on and on, the yacht had to nuzzle its way through a shore-to-shore, horizon-to-horizon carpet of bobbing plastic bottles. They had contained brake fluid and laundry bleach and so on.\nFather had had a lot to do with the development of those bottles. He knew, too, that they could go on bobbing for 1,000 years. They were nothing to be proud of.\nIn a way, those bottles called him what the Freedom Fighters called Lyle Hooper.\nLyle\u2019s despairing last words as he was led out of the bell tower to be executed in front of Samoza Hall might be an apt epitaph for my father:\n29\nLYLE HOOPER\u2019S LAST words, I think we can say with the benefit of hindsight in the year 2001, might serve as an apt epitaph for a plurality of working adults in industrialized nations during the 20th Century. How could they help themselves, when so many of the jobs they or their mates could get had to do with large-scale deceptions, legal thefts from public treasuries, or the wrecking of the food chain, the topsoil, the water, or the atmosphere?\nAFTER LYLE HOOPER was executed, with a bullet behind the ear, I visited the Trustees in the stable. Tex Johnson was still spiked to the cross-timbers in the loft overhead, and they knew it.\nBut before I tell about that, I had better finish my story of how I got a job at Athena.\nSO THERE I was back in 1991, nursing a Budweiser, or \u201cwop,\u201d at the bar of the Black Cat Caf\u00e9.

He said that, two nights before, he had been coming in for a night landing at Will Fairchild Memorial Airport, and he had had to pull up at the last second because there was somebody out on the runway.\nWhoever it was fell down in a heap right in the middle of the runway, and then just stayed there. There were only two people inside the airport at that hour\u2014one in the tower, and the other waxing floors down below. So the floor waxer, who was one of the Gatch brothers, drove out on the runway in his own car.\nHe had to half-drag the mystery person into his car. It turned out to be Celia Hoover. She was barefoot, and wearing her husband\u2019s trenchcoat over a nightgown, and about five miles from home. She had evidently gone for a long walk, even though she was barefoot\u2014and she had got on the runway in the dark, thinking it was a road. And then the landing lights had come on all of a sudden, and the Barrytron Learjet had put a part in her hair.\nNobody notified the police or anybody. Gatch just took her home.\nGatch later told Tiger then there hadn\u2019t been anybody at her house to wonder where she had been, to be relieved that she was all right, and so on. She just went inside all alone, and presumably went to bed all alone. After she went inside, one light upstairs went on for about three minutes, and then went off again. It looked like a bathroom light.\nAccording to Tiger, Gatch said this to the blacked-out house: \u201cSleep tight, honeybunch.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThat isn\u2019t quite right. There had been a dog to welcome her home, but she hadn\u2019t paid any attention to the dog. She had put no value, as far as Gatch could see, on the dog\u2019s delight.

They had no proof one way or another, since all records pertaining to me had burned during the war. If I was a citizen of theirs, they said, they would be as pleased as Israel to have me for trial.\nIf I was a German, they said in effect, they were certainly ashamed of a German like me.\nSoviet Russia, in short words that sounded like ball bearings being dropped into wet gravel, said that no trial was necessary. A Fascist like me, they said, should be squashed underfoot like a cockroach.\nBut it was the anger of my neighbors that really stank of sudden death. The more barbaric newspapers printed without comment letters from people who wanted me displayed from coast to coast in an iron cage; from heroes who volunteered to serve in a firing squad for me, as though the use of small arms were a skill known to few; from people who planned to do nothing themselves, but were confident enough in American civilization to know that there were other, stronger, younger people who would know what to do.\nAnd these last-named patriots were right in having confidence. I doubt if there has ever been a society that has been without strong and young people eager to experiment with homicide, provided no very awful penalties are attached to it.\nAccording to the newspapers and radio, justifiably angry people had already done what they could about me, breaking into my ratty attic, smashing my windows, tearing up or carting off my worldly goods. The hated attic was now under police guard around the clock.\nThe New York Post pointed out editorially that the police could scarcely give me the protection I needed, since my enemies were so numerous and so understandably murderous. What was called for, said the Post helplessly, was a battalion of Marines to surround me for the rest of my days.\nThe New York Daily News suggested that my biggest war crime was not killing myself like a gentleman. Presumably Hitler was a gentleman.\nThe News, incidentally, also printed a letter from Bernard B. O\u2019Hare, the man who had captured me in Germany, the man who had recently written me a letter with copious carbons.\n\u201cI want this guy all for myself,\u201d O\u2019Hare wrote of me. \u201cI deserve this guy all for myself.

There is nothing left of that splendid instrument. Instead, there is something that uses his voice and body, that wheedles and tries to gain sympathy and freedom by shouting, among other bitter lies, that Tarbell was dumped into the drum by me. If I may say so, my own role has not been without pain and sacrifice.\nSince the Tarbell affair is, alas, controversial, and since, for propaganda reasons, our country cannot officially admit that the Devil was caught here, the Tarbell Protective Foundation is without Government subsidies. The expense of maintaining the Devil-trap and its contents has been borne by donations from public-spirited individuals like yourself.\nThe expenditures and proposed expenditures of the Foundation are extremely modest in proportion to value received by all humanity. We have done no more in the way of improving the physical plant than seemed absolutely necessary. The church has been roofed and painted and insulated and fenced in, and rotting timbers have been replaced by sound ones, and a heating system and an auxiliary generating system have been installed. You will agree that all of these items are essential.\nHowever, despite the limits we have placed on our spending, the Foundation finds that its treasury is badly depleted by the inroads of inflation. What we had laid aside for small improvements has been absorbed in bare maintenance. The Foundation employs a skeleton staff of three paid caretakers, who work in shifts around the clock, feeding Dr. Tarbell, keeping away thrill-seekers, and maintaining the vital electrical equipment. This staff cannot be cut without inviting the incomparable disaster of Armageddon\u2019s victory\u2019s turning to defeat in a single, unguarded instant. The directors, myself included, serve without compensation.\nBecause there is a larger need, beyond mere maintenance, we must go in search of new friends. That is why I am writing to you. Dr. Tarbell\u2019s immediate quarters have been enlarged since those first nightmarish months in the drum, and now comprise a copper-walled, insulated chamber eight feet in diameter and six feet high. But this is, you will admit, a poor home for what remains of Dr. Tarbell. We have hopes of being able, through open hearts and hands such as yours, to expand his quarters to include a small study, bedroom, and bath. And recent research indicates that there is every hope of giving him a current-carrying picture window, though the cost will be great.\nBut whatever the cost, we can make no sacrifices in scale with what Dr. Tarbell has done for us. And, if the contributions from new friends like you are great enough, we hope, in addition to expanding Dr. Tarbell\u2019s quarters, to be able to erect a suitable monument outside the church, bearing his likeness and the immortal words he wrote in a letter hours before he vanquished the Devil:\n\u201cIf I have succeeded tonight, then the Devil is no longer among men. I can do no more. Now, if others will rid the earth of vanity, ignorance, and want, mankind can live happily ever after.\u2014Dr. Gorman Tarbell.\u201d\nNo contribution is too small.\nRespectfully yours,\nDr. Lucifer J.

He asked me to use it as a regular part of my signature, and on my mailbox and letterheads and in directories, and so on. He said that the name was selected at immaculate random, and was not intended as a comment on my character or my appearance or my past.\nHe offered deceptively homely, almost inane examples of how I might serve artificial relatives: By watering their houseplants while they were away; by taking care of their babies so they could get out of the house for an hour or two; by telling them the name of a truly painless dentist; by mailing a letter for them; by keeping them company on a scary visit to a doctor; by visiting them in a jail or a hospital; by keeping them company at a scary picture show.\nHi ho.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI was enchanted by my new middle name, by the way.

They were simply stimulants to make the Earthlings perform vividly for the crowds at the zoo\u2014to make them jump up and down and cheer, or gloat, or sulk, or tear their hair, to be scared shitless or to feel as contented as babies in their mothers\u2019 arms.\nThe Earthlings did very well on paper. That was part of the rigging, of course. And religion got mixed up in it, too. The news ticker reminded them that the President of the United States had declared National Prayer Week, and that everybody should pray. The Earthlings had had a bad week on the market before that. They had lost a small fortune in olive oil futures. So they gave praying a whirl.\nIt worked. Olive oil went up.\nAnother Kilgore Trout book there in the window was about a man who built a time machine so he could go back and see Jesus. It worked, and he saw Jesus when Jesus was only twelve years old. Jesus was learning the carpentry trade from his father.\nTwo Roman soldiers came into the shop with a mechanical drawing on papyrus of a device they wanted built by sunrise the next morning. It was a cross to be used in the execution of a rabble-rouser.\nJesus and his father built it. They were glad to have the work. And the rabble-rouser was executed on it.\nSo it goes.\nThe bookstore was run by seeming quintuplets, by five short, bald men chewing unlit cigars that were sopping wet.

I thought Karabekian with his meaningless pictures had entered into a conspiracy with millionaires to make poor people feel stupid. I thought Beatrice Keedsler had joined hands with other old-fashioned storytellers to make people believe that life had leading characters, minor characters, significant details, insignificant details, that it had lessons to be learned, tests to be passed, and a beginning, a middle, and an end.\nAs I approached my fiftieth birthday, I had become more and more enraged and mystified by the idiot decisions made by my countrymen. And then I had come suddenly to pity them, for I understood how innocent and natural it was for them to behave so abominably, and with such abominable results: They were doing their best to live like people invented in story books. This was the reason Americans shot each other so often: It was a convenient literary device for ending short stories and books.\nWhy were so many Americans treated by their government as though their lives were as disposable as paper facial tissues? Because that was the way authors customarily treated bit-part players in their made-up tales.\nAnd so on.\nOnce I understood what was making America such a dangerous, unhappy nation of people who had nothing to do with real life, I resolved to shun storytelling. I would write about life. Every person would be exactly as important as any other. All facts would also be given equal weightiness. Nothing would be left out. Let others bring order to chaos. I would bring chaos to order, instead, which I think I have done.\nIf all writers would do that, then perhaps citizens not in the literary trades will understand that there is no order in the world around us, that we must adapt ourselves to the requirements of chaos instead.\nIt is hard to adapt to chaos, but it can be done. I am living proof of that: It can be done.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAdapting to chaos there in the cocktail lounge, I now had Bonnie MacMahon, who was exactly as important as anybody else in the Universe, bring more yeast excrement to Beatrice Keedsler and Karabekian.

This seemly shifting of weight was all things to all music, samba, waltz, gavotte, fox-trot, bunny hug, or hokeypokey. No matter what new dance craze came along, Pisquontuit overpowered it easily. The ballroom could have been filled with clear gelatin to shoulder height without hampering the dancers. It could have been filled to a point just below the dancers\u2019 nostrils, for that matter, for agreement on every subject was so complete that discussion had been reduced to a verbal shorthand resembling asthma.\nAnd there was Robert crossing and recrossing the ballroom floor like a Chris-Craft.\nNo one paid the slightest attention to Robert and his partner as they careered and careened. This indifference was equivalent to breaking a man on the wheel or throwing him down the oubliette in other times and places. Robert had put himself in the same class with the poor devil in Pisquontuit history who put lampblack on the bottom of his sailboat, another who found out too late that no one ever went swimming before eleven in the morning, and another who could not break the habit of saying okey dokey on the telephone.\nWhen the music was over, Robert\u2019s partner, flushed and rattled, excused herself, and Robert\u2019s father joined him by the bandstand.\nWhen Mr. Brewer was angry, he thrust his tongue between his teeth and talked around it, withdrawing it only to make s sounds. \u201cGood Lord, Bubs!\u201d he said to Robert. \u201cWhat do you think you are, a gigolo?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d said Robert, crimson. \u201cI never did a dance right before, and I just kind of went crazy.
