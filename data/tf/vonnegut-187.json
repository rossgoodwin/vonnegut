The person toting up a bill would simply punch the pictures of the various things a customer had ordered, and the cash register would add it up for him.\nFrank got a big bonus for that.\nMy guess is that the Saudis will keep him on.\nThere was a telegram to me from Dr. Robert Fender, still in prison in Georgia. Mary Kathleen had wanted RAMJAC to make him a vice-president, too, but there was no way to get him out of prison. Treason was just too serious a crime. Clyde Carter had written to him that I was going back to prison myself, and that there was going to be a party for me, and that he should send a telegram.\nThis was all it said: \u201cTing-a-ling.\u201d\nThat was from his science-fiction story about the judge from the planet Vicuna, of course, who had to find a new body to occupy, and who flew into my ear down there in Georgia, and found himself stuck to my feelings and destiny until I died.\nAccording to the judge in the story, that was how they said both hello and good-bye on Vicuna: \u201cTing-a-ling.\u201d\n\u201cTing-a-ling\u201d was like the Hawaiian \u201caloha,\u201d which also means both hello and good-bye.\n\u201cHello and good-bye.\u201d What else is there to say?

There were literally billions of happily self-handicapped people on Earth.\nAnd what made them all so happy was that nobody took advantage of anybody any more.\nNow the firemen thought of another way to express joy. There was a nozzle mounted amidships on the fire engine. It could be swiveled around like a machine gun. They aimed it straight up and turned it on. A shivering, unsure fountain climbed into the sky, was torn to shreds by the winds when it could climb no more. The shreds fell all around, now falling on the space ship with splattering thumps; now soaking the firemen themselves; now soaking women and children, startling them, then making them more full of joy than ever.\nThat water should have played such an important part in the welcoming of Unk was an enchanting accident. No one had planned it. But it was perfect that everyone should forget himself in a festival of universal wetness.\nThe Reverend C. Horner Redwine, feeling as naked as a pagan wood sprite in the clinging wetness of his clothes, swished a spray of lilacs over the glass of a porthole, then pressed his adoring face against the glass.\nThe expression of the face that looked back at Redwine was strikingly like the expression on the face of an intelligent ape in a zoo. Unk\u2019s forehead was deeply wrinkled, and his eyes were liquid with a hopeless wish to understand.\nUnk had decided not to be afraid.\nNeither was he in any hurry to let Redwine in.\nAt last he went to the airlock, unlatched both the inner and outer doors.

She asked me, \u201cWhat makes so many Americans proud of their ignorance? They act as though their ignorance somehow made them charming.\u201d\nI had been asked the same general question by Alton Darwin when I was working at Athena. A World War II movie was being shown on all the TVs over there. Frank Sinatra had been captured by the Germans, and he was being interrogated by an SS Major who spoke English at least as well as Sinatra, and who played the cello and painted watercolors in his spare time, and who told Sinatra how much he looked forward to getting back, when the war was over, to his first love, which was lepidopterology.\nSinatra didn\u2019t know what lepidopterology was. It is the study of moths and butterflies. That had to be explained to him.\nAnd Alton Darwin asked me, \u201cHow come in all these movies the Germans and the Japanese are always the smart ones, and the Americans are the dumb ones, and still the Americans win the war?\u201d\nDARWIN DIDN\u2019T FEEL personally involved. The American combat soldiers in the movie were all White. That wasn\u2019t just White propaganda. That happened to be historically accurate. During the Finale Rack, American military units were segregated according to race. The feeling back then was that Whites would feel like garbage if they had to share quarters and dining facilities and so on with Blacks. That went for civilian life, too. The Black people had their own schools, and they were excluded from most hotels and restaurants and places of entertainment, except onstage, and polling booths.\nThey were also strung up or burned alive or whatever from time to time, as reminders that their place was at the very bottom of Society. They were thought, when they were given soldier suits, to be lacking in determination and initiative in battle. So they were employed mostly as common laborers or truck drivers behind the Duke Waynes and Frank Sinatras, who did the fearless stuff.", 0.08600340136054424], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["city", 0.04], ["bomb", 0.03], ["guess", 0.03], ["people", 0.02], ["midland", 0.02], ["late", 0.02], ["going", 0.02], ["test", 0.02], ["neutron", 0.02], ["government", 0.02], ["pefko", 0.02], ["wild", 0.02], ["heart", 0.01], ["named", 0.01], ["set", 0.01], ["displeasure", 0.01], ["julian", 0.01], ["agreed", 0.01], ["felix", 0.01], ["turned", 0.01], ["manners", 0.01], ["bus", 0.01], ["cared", 0.01], ["high", 0.01], ["tearful", 0.01], ["businesses", 0.01], ["laugh", 0.01], ["soldiers", 0.01], ["ready", 0.01], ["uves", 0.01], ["rough", 0.01], ["foreign", 0.01], ["macaroon", 0.01], ["find", 0.01], ["detour", 0.01], ["captain", 0.01], ["bottom", 0.01], ["purple", 0.01], ["barry", 0.01], ["top", 0.01], ["slight", 0.01], ["cemetery", 0.01], ["weren", 0.01], ["harmless", 0.01], ["ideal", 0.01], ["parents", 0.01], ["forces", 0.01], ["laughed", 0.01], ["gate", 0.01], ["three", 0.01], ["war", 0.01], ["ketchum", 0.01], ["almond", 0.01], ["wished", 0.01], ["risk", 0.01], ["farmer", 0.01], ["knew", 0.01], ["contacts", 0.01], ["fred", 0.01], ["risked", 0.01], ["small", 0.01], ["running", 0.01], ["moving", 0.01], ["professional", 0.01], ["klan", 0.01], ["day", 0.01], ["grave", 0.01], ["school", 0.01], ["main", 0.01], ["couldn", 0.01], ["third", 0.01], ["country", 0.01], ["sinister", 0.01], ["chance", 0.01], ["worrying", 0.01], ["american", 0.01], ["calvary", 0.01], ["place", 0.01], ["supposed", 0.01], ["ku", 0.01], ["visit", 0.01], ["military", 0.01], ["starting", 0.01], ["klux", 0.01]], "sentiment": ["Ketchum said he certain wished he knew who these sinister forces were.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make a wild guess,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cand you\u2019re going to laugh at it, because the people I\u2019ll name want to be laughed at until it\u2019s too late.

do for me. I get hysterical from time to time. You remain calm. [\u2026]\nOne cause for my frenzy is financial: I\u2019ve sent gobs of savings to IRS, and soon even my savings will be gone. I am being totally ruined by prosperity, and I want Jane to see how it works. I wanted to get a small house in the country and a small car, and give up this apartment, but I don\u2019t see how I can afford even that. When you called me your two-hundred-thousand-a-year messenger (when I got the theater tickets), it was a crushing thought, because I somehow have tax liabilities in that amount, and resources approaching zero.\nIn order to take care of the children and Jane, I can think of only a couple of things to do: one is to wipe myself out, which I don\u2019t plan to do. The other is to stage a sort of bankruptcy, in which I turn over everything to Jane and you and Dan\u2014copyrights, stocks, all of it, and have you guys do whatever needs to be done with whatever there is to do it with. I have to give up, because I\u2019m obviously not bright about money at all. Otherwise, how could I be in such an impossible mess without even speculating or living especially high? Anyway\u2014you and Jane and Dan hold a meeting. I know it is the place of the man to do brilliant things with money, but this manhood thing has me completely worn out. I just want to be a writer.\nIf my next book is as good as I think it is, I should be in potter\u2019s field in no time. How do all these other freaks get to Easy Street?\nYours truly,\nKurt\nP.S.: I enclose an owl. I also wish to report that Vance Bourjaily\u2019s play is a perfect beauty. I\u2019ve seen it.
