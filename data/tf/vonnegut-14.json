see the hordes of Russians that are now swarming in to Saxony. When the advance troops first came, all the Germans were scared pink and hid in cellars. But they came in fine order, and they threw loaves of bread to the people, and they drove in fine American Lend-Lease cars, and they were spic and span. But then after a few days came the hordes of Russians. Talk about your Southern American negroes! Jesus! Those Russian masses are terrifying. They looted everything in sight. There was not a herd of cattle left in all Saxony. And do you really know what Vodka is like? Jesus! It\u2019s just straight alcohol, and they drink it by the tumbler full. Really, some scientists should investigate how it is possible for man to drink such stuff in such huge quantities. They are men! Oh, Christ, it was terrible\u2014the rapings and everything that went on.\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me! I know what\u2019s going to happen in Europe. Now the trouble really starts. The French hate the Americans; the Poles and Russians hate the Germans; the Poles hate the Russians; everybody hates the Germans\u2014except the Americans, who are giving the Germans five eggs every week in the territory occupied by American troops. And I am here to say that I\u2019ve got it in for the British. They aren\u2019t good sports. You ought to see the negro troops in France. Are they going big! But don\u2019t tell me that the American negro isn\u2019t a good fighter. They are just as brave and good soldiers as any of \u2019em\u2014American, German or Russian. It\u2019s fun to see the negroes gamble with their money: \u2018Yeah! Shoot another ten sport. I got lots and beaucoup of money\u2014beaucoup of money!\u2019 And they shoot it away\u2014all of their beaucoup of money. And what they are doing to the French girls! It\u2019s no wonder the French feel so bitter against the Americans.\u201d\nWhen we arrived at Louise Adams\u2019 house we picked up the baby, which Kay had not seen since October, 1944. It was in that month that he left home. \u201cKay,\u201d I said, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to be patient with us civilians. We\u2019ll probably say things that are mightily offensive to you because we haven\u2019t enough imagination to understand what you have gone through.\u201d Kay\u2019s response was: \u201cOh, hell! I want to be a civilian myself. I\u2019m sick and tired of being in the infantry. I want to get out of the army. Look at me. My arm and leg muscles have all atrophied. But I\u2019ll have 76 days of furlough here at home, and then I\u2019m off to Florida where I\u2019ll be housed in one of the finest hotels in Miami. I\u2019ve got my pullman reservations right here. And then \u2026 well\u2014then what? Damned if I know. But I want to get out of the army, I tell you. I want to get out. I\u2019ve had enough of it. And I\u2019m goddamned sick and tired of the whole damnfool bloody mess. I\u2019m sick of it!\u201d\nJanuary 26, 1947\nTO JANE VONNEGUT\nAs the wife of a writer of the era, Jane Vonnegut took on not only the customary household duties but a whole set of other jobs that were expected of wives by their writer\u2013husbands, including editing and copyediting, mailing of manuscripts, acting as intermediary between husbands and their agents, editors, and publishers, serving as in-house publicists and marketing assistants, and in most cases typing up manuscripts. Kurt was always proud of the fact that, unlike most writer\u2013husbands, he never asked Jane to do any of his typing, which in itself made him a vanguard of liberation in that era.\nCONTRACT between KURT VONNEGUT, JR. and JANE C.\nVONNEGUT, effective as of Sunday, January 26, 1947\nI, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., that is, do hereby swear that I will be faithful to the commitments hereunder listed:\nI. With the agreement that my wife will not nag, heckle, and otherwise disturb me, on the subject, I promise to scrub the bathroom and kitchen floors once a week, on a day and hour of my own choosing.

suddenly interrupted for a news bulletin. It wasn\u2019t clear at first as to what the bulletin was about, since the announcer, like all announcers, had a serious speech impediment. For about half a minute, and in a state of high excitement, the announcer tried to say, \"Ladies and gentlemen\u2014\"\nHe finally gave up, handed the bulletin to a ballerina to read.\n\"That\u2019s all right\u2014\" Hazel said of the announcer, \"he tried. That\u2019s the big thing. He tried to do the best he could with what God gave him. He should get a nice raise for trying so hard.\"\n\"Ladies and gentlemen\u2014\" said the ballerina, reading the bulletin. She must have been extraordinarily beautiful, because the mask she wore was hideous. And it was easy to see that she was the strongest and most graceful of all the dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two-hundred-pound men.\nAnd she had to apologize at once for her voice, which was a very unfair voice for a woman to use. Her voice was a warm, luminous, timeless melody. \"Excuse me\u2014\" she said, and she began again, making her voice absolutely uncompetitive.\n\"Harrison Bergeron, age fourteen,\" she said in a grackle squawk, \"has just escaped from jail, where he was held on suspicion of plotting to overthrow the government. He is a genius and an athlete, is under-handicapped, and should be regarded as extremely dangerous.\"\nA police photograph of Harrison Bergeron was flashed on the screen\u2014upside down, then sideways, upside down again, then right side up. The picture showed the full length of Harrison against a background calibrated in feet and inches. He was exactly seven feet tall.\nThe rest of Harrison\u2019s appearance was Halloween and hardware. Nobody had ever borne heavier handicaps. He had outgrown hindrances faster than the H-G men could think them up. Instead of a little ear radio for a mental handicap, he wore a tremendous pair of earphones, and spectacles with thick wavy lenses. The spectacles were intended to make him not only half blind, but to give him whanging headaches besides.\nScrap metal was hung all over him. Ordinarily, there was a certain symmetry, a military neatness to the handicaps issued to strong people, but Harrison looked like a walking junkyard. In the race of life, Harrison carried three hundred pounds.\nAnd to offset his good looks, the H-G men required that he wear at all times a red rubber ball for a nose, keep his eyebrows shaved off, and cover his even white teeth with black caps at snaggle-tooth random.", 0.06308265582655828], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["music", 0.1282051282051282], ["long", 0.05128205128205128], ["guesses", 0.02564102564102564], ["jews", 0.02564102564102564], ["deal", 0.02564102564102564], ["played", 0.02564102564102564], ["money", 0.02564102564102564], ["forbidden", 0.02564102564102564], ["auschwitz", 0.02564102564102564], ["middle", 0.02564102564102564], ["good", 0.02564102564102564], ["volunteered", 0.02564102564102564], ["best", 0.02564102564102564], ["announcement", 0.02564102564102564], ["eye", 0.02564102564102564], ["silent", 0.02564102564102564], ["pay", 0.02564102564102564], ["book", 0.02564102564102564], ["answer", 0.02564102564102564], ["announcements", 0.02564102564102564], ["loudspeakers", 0.02564102564102564], ["told", 0.02564102564102564], ["confessed", 0.02564102564102564], ["day", 0.02564102564102564], ["great", 0.02564102564102564], ["straight", 0.02564102564102564], ["camp", 0.02564102564102564], ["modern", 0.02564102564102564], ["thought", 0.02564102564102564], ["thing", 0.02564102564102564], ["interesting", 0.02564102564102564], ["stopping", 0.02564102564102564], ["naturally", 0.02564102564102564], ["musical", 0.02564102564102564]], "sentiment": ["\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I would pay a great deal of money for a book with the answer in it.\u201d\n\u201cAny guesses?\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, looking me straight in the eye, \u201ceven though I was one of the ones who volunteered.\u201d\nHe went away for a little while, after having confessed that.

He crossed the room to a chair next to the range, made a brief bow to each person at the table, and sat down.\n\u201cAnnie\u2019ll get you some coffee, Mr. Banghart,\u201d said the General. \u201cBy the way, you haven\u2019t met my nephew, have you?

Wait and see.\u201d\nHaley rubbed his smarting eyes, and brought into focus the face of Hope, who was rocking from side to side with laughter. He felt utterly humiliated standing before her, comical in his weakness, and in his clothing \u2014 cast-off work clothes of the General, too short, too wide, high on his ankles and wrists, bunched at his waist. Exhaustion and sudden loneliness billowed in his narrow breast. He sank to the ground again.\nThe General eased himself down from his perch, and stood over him, kicking gently at the soles of his shoes, and chiding, \u201cCome on, boy, get up. All right, get up.\u201d Haley stood. The General seemed more embarrassed than angry. \u201cThat\u2019s enough of that,\u201d he said. \u201cMooning and malingering will get you nowhere around here, do you understand? I\u2019m ashamed of you.\u201d\n\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Haley heard Hope call.\nBlushing and apologizing in half-soliloquy, he clambered atop the wagon, unable to look at Hope. Mr. Banghart swung three more bales up to Hope, and the wagon moved, jolting and creaking, toward the barnyard.\nIn the still, dry heat of the loft, under a tin roof too hot to touch, Hope, Haley, and Mr. Banghart dragged bale after bale from the wagon, over the splintered floor, to a growing stack deep in the shadows of one end. The General remained on the wagon to steady the horses. Tormenting himself, Haley tried to imagine what the others were thinking of him. Hope was the only one he really cared about. The two of them worked together, their hooks driven into the same bale. She said nothing, and concentrated her attention on the hard work to be done. He was bewildered by the effect her presence had had upon him since the first instant he had seen her. He now found her more beautiful than ever, with her hair lightened by dust, and with heat bringing her loose clothes into conformity with the lines of her young figure.\nMr. Banghart rolled a cigarette, politely excused himself, and went out into the barnyard to smoke it. The General joined him with a cigar, leaving Haley and Hope alone in the barn. Haley sat down on a bale next to Hope. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019ll get used to farm work after a while,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all did. Takes about a month.\u201d\nFor want of a rational comment on this message, Haley changed the subject. \u201cMr. Banghart is a funny one,\u201d he said. \u201cI never knew anyone to talk to himself so much.\u201d\nHope giggled. \u201cHe\u2019s got a screw loose, all right, but the General says he\u2019s the best worker we ever had on the farm,\u201d she said. \u201cTry and hear what he talks to himself about sometime. It\u2019s all about what he\u2019s going to do to people he thinks are out to get him \u2014 which is practically everybody. You\u2019re lucky; he liked you right away, and that\u2019s unusual.\u201d She became more thoughtful. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t laugh. It\u2019s kind of sad about him, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cHas he ever done anything to anybody?\u201d asked Haley uneasily.", 0.1329403822673053], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["war", 0.04065040650406504], ["hare", 0.024390243902439025], ["ice", 0.024390243902439025], ["mary", 0.024390243902439025], ["wouldn", 0.016260162601626018], ["babies", 0.016260162601626018], ["tray", 0.016260162601626018], ["house", 0.016260162601626018], ["remembered", 0.016260162601626018], ["noise", 0.016260162601626018], ["sink", 0.016260162601626018], ["drunk", 0.016260162601626018], ["wasn", 0.016260162601626018], ["lot", 0.016260162601626018], ["anger", 0.016260162601626018], ["moving", 0.016260162601626018], ["remember", 0.016260162601626018], ["bombed", 0.008130081300813009], ["booze", 0.008130081300813009], ["clocks", 0.008130081300813009], ["banged", 0.008130081300813009], ["soldiers", 0.008130081300813009], ["cola", 0.008130081300813009], ["hadn", 0.008130081300813009], ["true", 0.008130081300813009], ["finally", 0.008130081300813009], ["cube", 0.008130081300813009], ["fragment", 0.008130081300813009], ["couple", 0.008130081300813009], ["shutting", 0.008130081300813009], ["grin", 0.008130081300813009], ["furniture", 0.008130081300813009], ["wagon", 0.008130081300813009], ["belts", 0.008130081300813009], ["married", 0.008130081300813009], ["ignore", 0.008130081300813009], ["guy", 0.008130081300813009], ["fixed", 0.008130081300813009], ["husband", 0.008130081300813009], ["upstairs", 0.008130081300813009], ["full", 0.008130081300813009], ["chuckle", 0.008130081300813009], ["clock", 0.008130081300813009], ["memories", 0.008130081300813009], ["dirt", 0.008130081300813009], ["factory", 0.008130081300813009], ["drawn", 0.008130081300813009], ["dresden", 0.008130081300813009], ["opening", 0.008130081300813009], ["rolled", 0.008130081300813009], ["burn", 0.008130081300813009], ["wheelbarrow", 0.008130081300813009], ["kitchen", 0.008130081300813009], ["cubes", 0.008130081300813009], ["couldn", 0.008130081300813009], ["larger", 0.008130081300813009], ["conversation", 0.008130081300813009], ["asked", 0.008130081300813009], ["looted", 0.008130081300813009], ["family", 0.008130081300813009], ["imagine", 0.008130081300813009], ["embarrassed", 0.008130081300813009], ["virgins", 0.008130081300813009], ["horse", 0.008130081300813009], ["foolish", 0.008130081300813009], ["stainless", 0.008130081300813009], ["angry", 0.008130081300813009], ["happy", 0.008130081300813009], ["coke", 0.008130081300813009], ["russian", 0.008130081300813009], ["smoking", 0.008130081300813009], ["nodded", 0.008130081300813009], ["steel", 0.008130081300813009], ["kind", 0.008130081300813009], ["work", 0.008130081300813009], ["stories", 0.008130081300813009], ["coca", 0.008130081300813009], ["newspaper", 0.008130081300813009], ["making", 0.008130081300813009], ["turned", 0.008130081300813009], ["talking", 0.008130081300813009], ["good", 0.008130081300813009], ["worry", 0.008130081300813009], ["sat", 0.008130081300813009], ["huge", 0.008130081300813009], ["sit", 0.008130081300813009], ["write", 0.008130081300813009], ["book", 0.008130081300813009], ["doors", 0.008130081300813009], ["wrong", 0.008130081300813009], ["plenty", 0.008130081300813009], ["coming", 0.008130081300813009], ["refrigerator", 0.008130081300813009], ["man", 0.008130081300813009], ["banging", 0.008130081300813009], ["brought", 0.008130081300813009], ["childhood", 0.008130081300813009], ["cigarettes", 0.008130081300813009], ["lying", 0.008130081300813009], ["wine", 0.008130081300813009]], "sentiment": ["So we sat down. O\u2019Hare was embarrassed, but he wouldn\u2019t tell me what was wrong. I couldn\u2019t imagine what it was about me that could burn up Mary so. I was a family man. I\u2019d been married only once. I wasn\u2019t a drunk. I hadn\u2019t done her husband any dirt in the war.\nShe fixed herself a Coca-Cola, made a lot of noise banging the ice-cube tray in the stainless steel sink. Then she went into another part of the house. But she wouldn\u2019t sit still. She was moving all over the house, opening and shutting doors, even moving furniture around to work off anger.\nI asked O\u2019Hare what I\u2019d said or done to make her act that way.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you.\u201d That was kind of him. He was lying. It had everything to do with me.\nSo we tried to ignore Mary and remember the war. I took a couple of belts of the booze I\u2019d brought. We would chuckle or grin sometimes, as though war stories were coming back, but neither one of us could remember anything good. O\u2019Hare remembered one guy who got into a lot of wine in Dresden, before it was bombed, and we had to take him home in a wheelbarrow. It wasn\u2019t much to write a book about. I remembered two Russian soldiers who had looted a clock factory. They had a horse-drawn wagon full of clocks. They were happy and drunk. They were smoking huge cigarettes they had rolled in newspaper.\nThat was about it for memories, and Mary was still making noise. She finally came out in the kitchen again for another Coke. She took another tray of ice cubes from the refrigerator, banged it in the sink, even though there was already plenty of ice out.\nThen she turned to me, let me see how angry she was, and that the anger was for me. She had been talking to herself, so what she said was a fragment of a much larger conversation. \u201cYou were just babies then!\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou were just babies in the war\u2014like the ones upstairs!\u201d\nI nodded that this was true.

Winston Niles Rumfoord\u2019s smile and handshake dismantled Constant\u2019s high opinion of himself as efficiently as carnival roustabouts might dismantle a Ferris wheel.\nConstant, who had offered his services to God as a messenger, now panicked before the very moderate greatness of Rumfoord. Constant ransacked his memory for past proofs of his own greatness. He ransacked his memory like a thief going through another man\u2019s billfold. Constant found his memory stuffed with rumpled, overexposed snapshots of all the women he had had, with preposterous credentials testifying to his ownership of even more preposterous enterprises, with testimonials that attributed to him virtues and strengths that only three billion dollars could have. There was even a silver medal with a red ribbon\u2014awarded to Constant for placing second in the hop, skip, and jump in an intramural track meet at the University of Virginia.\nRumfoord\u2019s smile went on and on.\nTo follow the analogy of the thief who is going through another man\u2019s billfold: Constant ripped open the seams of his memory, hoping to find a secret compartment with something of value in it. There was no secret compartment\u2014nothing of value.

himself off as an educated man from time to time. He was considering claiming, during \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century,\u201d to be a mechanical engineer from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, whose wife had recently died of cancer.\nActually, his formal education had stopped after two years of instruction in automobile repair and maintenance at the vocational high school in his native city of Midland City, Ohio. He was then living in the fifth of a series of foster homes, essentially an orphan, since he was the product of an incestuous relationship between a father and a daughter who had run away from town, forever and together, soon after he was born.\nWhen he himself was old enough to run away, he hitchhiked to the island of Manhattan. A pimp there befriended him and taught him how to be a successful homosexual prostitute, to leave price tags on his clothes, to really enjoy lovers whenever possible, and so on. Wait was once quite beautiful.\nWhen his beauty began to fade, he became an instructor in ballroom dancing at a dance studio. He was a natural dancer, and he had been told back in Midland City that his parents had been very good dancers, too. His sense of rhythm was probably inherited. And it was at the dance studio that he met and courted and married the first of his seventeen wives so far.\nAll through his childhood, Wait was severely punished by foster parents for nothing and everything.

I would have been tongue-tied in the presence of such national treasures.\nI did get to know one socialist of their generation\u2014Powers Hapgood of Indianapolis. He was a typical Hoosier idealist. Socialism is idealistic. Hapgood, like Debs, was a middle-class person who thought there could be more economic justice in this country. He wanted a better country, that\u2019s all.\nAfter graduating from Harvard, he went to work as a coal miner, urging his working-class brothers to organize in order to get better pay and safer working conditions. He also led protesters at the execution of the anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti in Massachusetts in 1927.\nHapgood\u2019s family owned a successful cannery in Indianapolis, and when Powers Hapgood inherited it, he turned it over to the employees, who ruined it.\nWe met in Indianapolis after the end of the Second World War. He had become an official in the CIO. There had been some sort of dust-up on a picket line, and he was testifying about it in court, and the judge stops everything and asks him, \u201cMr. Hapgood, here you are, you\u2019re a graduate of Harvard. Why would anyone with your advantages choose to live as you have?\u201d Hapgood answered the judge: \u201cWhy, because of the Sermon on the Mount, sir.\u201d\nAnd again: Hooray for our team.\nI am from a family of artists. Here I am, making a living in the arts. It has not been a rebellion. It\u2019s as though I had taken over the family Esso station.

Malamud and James Dickey and Joseph Heller and many other first-rate patriots, are regularly thrown out of public-school libraries by school board members, who commonly say that they have not actually read the books, but that they have it on good authority that the books are bad for children.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMy novel Slaughterhouse-Five was actually burned in a furnace by a school janitor in Drake, North Dakota, on instructions from the school committee there, and the school board made public statements about the unwholesomeness of the book. Even by the standards of Queen Victoria, the only offensive line in the entire novel is this: \u201cGet out of the road, you dumb motherfucker.\u201d This is spoken by an American antitank gunner to an unarmed American chaplain\u2019s assistant during the Battle of the Bulge in Europe in December 1944, the largest single defeat of American arms (the Confederacy excluded) in history. The chaplain\u2019s assistant had attracted enemy fire.\nSo on November 16, 1973, I wrote as follows to Charles McCarthy of Drake, North Dakota:\nDear Mr. McCarthy:\nI am writing to you in your capacity as chairman of the Drake School Board. I am among those American writers whose books have been destroyed in the now famous furnace of your school.\nCertain members of your community have suggested that my work is evil. This is extraordinarily insulting to me. The news from Drake indicates to me that books and writers are very unreal to you people. I am writing this letter to let you know how real I am.\nI want you to know, too, that my publisher and I have done absolutely nothing to exploit the disgusting news from Drake. We are not clapping each other on the back, crowing about all the books we will sell because of the news. We have declined to go on television, have written no fiery letters to editorial pages, have granted no lengthy interviews. We are angered and sickened and saddened. And no copies of this letter have been sent to anybody else. You now hold the only copy in your hands. It is a strictly private letter from me to the people of Drake, who have done so much to damage my reputation in the eyes of their children and then in the eyes of the world. Do you have the courage and ordinary decency to show this letter to the people, or will it, too, be consigned to the fires of your furnace?\nI gather from what I read in the papers and hear on television that you imagine me, and some other writers, too, as being sort of ratlike people who enjoy making money from poisoning the minds of young people. I am in fact a large, strong person, fifty-one years old, who did a lot of farm work as a boy, who is good with tools. I have raised six children, three my own and three adopted. They have all turned out well. Two of them are farmers. I am a combat infantry veteran from World War II, and hold a Purple Heart. I have earned whatever I own by hard work. I have never been arrested or sued for anything. I am so much trusted with young people and by young people that I have served on the faculties of the University of Iowa, Harvard, and the City College of New York. Every year I receive at least a dozen invitations to be commencement speaker at colleges and high schools. My books are probably more widely used in schools than those of any other living American fiction writer.\nIf you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don\u2019t damage children much. They didn\u2019t damage us when we were young.

It is an invention, a mosaic composed of bits taken from tales of many such riots in not such olden times.\nIt is a legend in the mind of the leading character in this book, Walter F. Starbuck, whose life was accidentally shaped by the Massacre, even though it took place on Christmas morning in eighteen hundred ninety-four, long before Starbuck was born.\nIt goes like this:\nIn October of 1894 Daniel McCone, the founder and owner of the Cuyahoga Bridge and Iron Company, then the largest single employer in Cleveland, Ohio, informed his factory workers through their foremen that they were to accept a 10 percent cut in pay. There was no union. McCone was a hard-bitten and brilliant little mechanical engineer, self-educated, born of working-class parents in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nHalf his work force, about a thousand men, under the leadership of an ordinary foundryman with a gift for oratory, Colin Jarvis, walked out, forcing the plant to shut down. They had found it almost impossible to feed and shelter and clothe their families even without the cut in wages. All of them were white. Most of them were native-born.\nNature sympathized that day. The sky and Lake Erie were identical in color, the same dead pewter-gray.\nThe little homes toward which the strikers trudged were near the factory. Many of them were owned, and their neighborhood grocery stores, too, by Cuyahoga Bridge and Iron.", -0.0010515873015873034], "title": "Jailbird"}, "petrified-ants": {"tfidf": [["ants",

picked up the chip that showed the bas-relief of the pincerless ant\u2019s death struggle with countless warriors. \u201cThere were these lawless ants, such as the one in the center, capitalists who attacked and exploited the workers\u2014ruthlessly killing, as we can see here, scores at a time.\u201d He set down the melancholy exhibit, and picked up the house into which the pincerless ants were crammed. \u201cAnd here we have a conspiratorial meeting of the lawless ants, plotting against the workers. Fortunately\u201d\u2014and he pointed to the soldier ants outside the door\u2014\u201ctheir plot was overheard by vigilant workers.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he continued brightly, holding up samples from the next layer, a meeting of the pincered ants and the home of a solitary ant, \u201cthe workers held democratic indignation meetings, and drove their oppressors out of their community. The capitalists, overthrown, but with their lives spared by the merciful common people, were soft and spoiled, unable to survive without the masses to slave for them. They could only dillydally with the arts. Hence, put on their own mettle, they soon became extinct.\u201d He folded his arms with an air of finality and satisfaction.\n\u201cBut the order was just the reverse,\u201d objected Peter. \u201cThe ant civilization was wrecked when some of the ants started growing pincers and going around in mobs. You can\u2019t argue with geology.\u201d\n\u201cThen an inversion has taken place in the limestone layer\u2014some kind of upheaval turned it upside down. Obviously.\u201d Borzorov sounded like sheathed ice. \u201cWe have the most conclusive evidence of all\u2014the evidence of logic. The sequence could only have been as I described it.

With a telescope, Rice could pick out small towns and the wakes of ships without much trouble. It would be breathtaking to watch the enormous blue-and-green ball, to see night creeping around it, and clouds and storms growing and swirling over its face.\nDr. Groszinger tamped out his cigarette, absently lit another almost at once, and strode down the corridor to the small laboratory where the radio equipment had been set up.\nLieutenant General Franklin Dane, head of Project Cyclops, sat next to the radio operator, his uniform rumpled, his collar open. The General stared expectantly at the loudspeaker before him. The floor was littered with sandwich wrappings and cigarette butts.

Over.\u201d Groszinger, his arm draped around the General\u2019s shoulders, leaned forward eagerly, his ear a few inches from the speaker. The radio operator turned the volume down, so that they could hear something of the quality of Major Rice\u2019s voice.\nThe voice came through again, soft, hesitant.
