The cream of the East and Middle West, engineeringwise and managerwise, was met in the amphitheater of the Meadows. It was the second night, the night of the keynote play and the bonfire.

Shepherd, in his determination to win and his horror of losing, had blown up completely.\nPaul, by contrast, had played heads-up ball all the way, effortlessly, laughingly, wholly out of character. In analyzing the magical quality of the afternoon during the cocktail hour, Paul realized what had happened: for the first time since he\u2019d made up his mind to quit, he really hadn\u2019t given a damn about the system, about the Meadows, about intramural politics. He\u2019d tried not to give a damn before, but he hadn\u2019t had much luck. Now, suddenly, as of the afternoon, he was his own man.\nPaul was half tight, and pleased with himself. Everything was going to be just fine.\n\u201cThe Old Man wants to start the meeting shortly after his plane lands,\u201d said Kroner, \u201cso we\u2019ll have to leave whatever\u2019s going on.\u201d", 0.15343915343915343], "title": "Player Piano"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["door", 0.07142857142857142], ["murra", 0.07142857142857142], ["em", 0.03571428571428571], ["forget", 0.03571428571428571], ["pardon", 0.03571428571428571], ["send", 0.03571428571428571], ["hell", 0.03571428571428571], ["trip", 0.03571428571428571], ["wire", 0.03571428571428571], ["dump", 0.03571428571428571], ["long", 0.03571428571428571], ["enclosure", 0.03571428571428571], ["call", 0.03571428571428571], ["finish", 0.03571428571428571], ["return", 0.03571428571428571], ["throw", 0.03571428571428571], ["man", 0.03571428571428571], ["distance", 0.03571428571428571], ["windows", 0.03571428571428571], ["bill", 0.03571428571428571], ["beg", 0.03571428571428571], ["trak", 0.03571428571428571], ["credit", 0.03571428571428571], ["expecting", 0.03571428571428571], ["fleetwood", 0.03571428571428571], ["bathtub", 0.03571428571428571]], "sentiment": ["\"It\u2019s me, Mr. Murra,\" I said.\n\"It\u2019s who?\" he said.\n\"The bathtub enclosure man,\" I said.\n\"I was expecting a very important long-distance call,\" he said. \"Please get off the wire.\"\n\"I beg your pardon,\" I said. \"I just want to know when you want me to finish up there.\"\n\"Never!\" he said. \"Forget it!

It is meant to be a quite universal analysis of the current sexual revolution. According to T\u00e1lese, women are becoming more hospitable and casual, less discriminating with respect to sexual contacts. I oversimplify but do not entirely misrepresent that supposed revolution if I describe it this way: Whereas an ideal woman in olden times might have given a dusty male wayfarer on the road of life a piece of pie\u2014a modern woman may now give him a hand job or a blow job as well.\nI am sorry, but that is how I read it.\nI do not wish to mock the book, even having said that, for it is to me a secretly deep history of a generation of middle-class American males, my own, which was taught by parents and athletic coaches and scoutmasters and military chaplains and quack doctors and so on to be deeply ashamed of masturbation and wet dreams.\nAnd the hidden plea in the book is one which first appeared in my eyes when I was fourteen, say, and which has not vanished entirely to this day. It is part of the mystery of me. The plea is addressed by old-fashioned males forever full of jism to any pretty human female, on the street, in a magazine, in a movie\u2014anywhere. The plea is this: \u201cPlease, pretty lady, don\u2019t make me play with my private parts again.\u201d\n19\nIN THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD", 0.13655913978494627], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["ben", 0.12987012987012986], ["rose", 0.09090909090909091], ["twelve", 0.05194805194805195], ["forget", 0.05194805194805195], ["love", 0.03896103896103896], ["kilraine", 0.025974025974025976], ["matters", 0.025974025974025976], ["kiss", 0.025974025974025976], ["fortune", 0.025974025974025976], ["dollars", 0.025974025974025976], ["walking", 0.012987012987012988], ["lightly", 0.012987012987012988], ["suddenly", 0.012987012987012988], ["turned", 0.012987012987012988], ["head", 0.012987012987012988], ["deep", 0.012987012987012988], ["lies", 0.012987012987012988], ["good", 0.012987012987012988], ["carefully", 0.012987012987012988], ["heartbroken", 0.012987012987012988], ["blue", 0.012987012987012988], ["grabbed", 0.012987012987012988], ["girls", 0.012987012987012988], ["waiting", 0.012987012987012988], ["slowly", 0.012987012987012988], ["touched", 0.012987012987012988], ["ducked", 0.012987012987012988], ["quietly", 0.012987012987012988], ["hat", 0.012987012987012988], ["prettier", 0.012987012987012988], ["life", 0.012987012987012988], ["full", 0.012987012987012988], ["door", 0.012987012987012988], ["closed", 0.012987012987012988], ["passionately", 0.012987012987012988], ["dollar", 0.012987012987012988], ["men", 0.012987012987012988], ["cottage", 0.012987012987012988], ["romeo", 0.012987012987012988], ["man", 0.012987012987012988], ["wept", 0.012987012987012988], ["cap", 0.012987012987012988], ["walked", 0.012987012987012988], ["face", 0.012987012987012988], ["turn", 0.012987012987012988], ["goodbye", 0.012987012987012988], ["timed", 0.012987012987012988], ["yell", 0.012987012987012988], ["marry", 0.012987012987012988]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYes,\u201d said Ben.

I sent a package up with Mark, which is a fair guarantee that you never got it. But the hell with the package. The thing to celebrate is your discovery and mastery of your own sweet and melodious voice. The piece about traveling with Nanny cross country is a knockout. There isn\u2019t a flaw in it anywhere. And it would be that well-written, even if you weren\u2019t as well-educated as you are. The secret of good writing is caring.\nI\u2019m fresh back from the Worker\u2019s Paradise. The elevators still don\u2019t work, and it\u2019s still perfect hell to be a Jew over there. Hi ho. I don\u2019t intend to write about it. I was sweet as pie, and didn\u2019t ask a single embarrassing question. And over here I never crack off in public about Solzhenitsyn or any of the hundreds of writers in jails and loony bins. There are plenty of others to do that. I am a vice president of American P.E.N., and I ask favors from the other side from time to time. And they may listen to me, since my public record is so uncontroversial. And maybe not. What the hell. I am now trying to work out a scheme whereby all the rubles earned by American writers before the new International Copyright Agreements (last May or so) can, if unclaimed, be pooled into a scholarship fund for young American writers who want to visit the USSR. This is totally my crazy idea. We\u2019ll see.\nAs I peter out creatively, I become more and more of a cultural bureaucrat. I don\u2019t consider this a tragedy, unless becoming older and doing what older people do is a tragedy. I suppose that Daphne has told you what is in store for both us Scorpios. Huge changes are in store, and they will be terribly interesting and wrenching, and all we can do is ride along. Well\u2014hang on.
