You\u2019ll be an excellent teacher. Your ego will demand it, and so will your students. You\u2019ll have an appalling number of real writers entrusted to your care. The classes don\u2019t matter much. The real business, head-to-head, is done during office hours in the afternoons. Mornings are for writing\u2014and so are most of the afternoons. The Workshop has always been staffed by professionals, so staffers have almost always been self-educated and worse-educated than you. Forget your lack of credentials. The University is perfectly used to barbarians in the Workshop, thinks nothing of it. I have no degree. Yates has no degree. Algren had one, but tried to hush it up (Journalism B.A., U. of Illinois). And so on. You will be as glorious as any full professor because you know REAL WRITERS and REAL EDITORS in BOSTON and NEW YORK.\nThere are plenty of quite pleasant bars with pool tables in back. I was fond of Donnelly\u2019s. Restaurants are poor generally. You go to Cedar Rapids for seafood. Go to the Lark for steak. There are four movie houses which change their bills about every three days, and Iowa City is a college town and nothing else, so the bills are good. You\u2019ll keep up easily with the movie thing.\nEvery so often you will go nuts. All of a sudden the cornfields get you. Fly to Chicago or New York. Cancel classes whenever you damn please. Nobody will be checking up on you. And use the Cedar Rapids Airport instead of the Iowa City Airport. Fly United instead of Ozarks.\nThe new head of the Workshop, George Starbuck, is a close friend and a great man. Trust him entirely. The former head, Paul Engle, is still around, is a hayseed clown, a foxy grandpa, a terrific promoter who, if you listen closely, talks like a man with a paper asshole. He has a Taiwanese mistress, Leslie Nieh, who will have an office near yours. He is mad for gooks. Forget him. Graduate assistants write his books for him. Burn this letter.\nVance is a poor teacher, spends most of his time on his farm, wants to be a full professor. He is very powerful politically, and, as we know, a fine friend and writer\u2014but, like I say, he is lazy as hell around the Workshop. My feeling about this is mainly\u2014so what? He will want you to hunt with him. Do it. He\u2019s a master. Like you, he\u2019s a great cook.\nDon\u2019t ball undergraduates. Their parents are still watching.\nRun with the painters. I did. The best guy in Iowa City is painter Byron Burford. There isn\u2019t anybody to watch out for. Nobody pays any attention to anybody else, so there isn\u2019t any jealousy or competition or any of that crap. Lecture as Gehman, not as a college professor. Gehman is who they hired. Be very commercial.\nGo to all the football games. They are great. Iowa should be a .500 club this year.\nCheers,\nKurt", 0.26446248196248195], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["letter", 0.039603960396039604], ["steps", 0.019801980198019802], ["bernie", 0.019801980198019802], ["general", 0.019801980198019802], ["electric", 0.019801980198019802], ["timequake", 0.009900990099009901], ["dollar", 0.009900990099009901], ["ge", 0.009900990099009901], ["kill", 0.009900990099009901], ["mentioned", 0.009900990099009901], ["find", 0.009900990099009901], ["grotesque", 0.009900990099009901], ["1947", 0.009900990099009901], ["going", 0.009900990099009901], ["employee", 0.009900990099009901], ["piano", 0.009900990099009901], ["fool", 0.009900990099009901], ["tickled", 0.009900990099009901], ["woman", 0.009900990099009901], ["material", 0.009900990099009901], ["telling", 0.009900990099009901], ["day", 0.009900990099009901], ["alex", 0.009900990099009901], ["lost", 0.009900990099009901], ["brother", 0.009900990099009901], ["guy", 0.009900990099009901], ["spiritual", 0.009900990099009901], ["fired", 0.009900990099009901], ["ten", 0.009900990099009901], ["born", 0.009900990099009901], ["cost", 0.009900990099009901], ["lawyer", 0.009900990099009901], ["peter", 0.009900990099009901], ["intended", 0.009900990099009901], ["legal", 0.009900990099009901], ["cradle", 0.009900990099009901], ["told", 0.009900990099009901], ["circumstance", 0.009900990099009901], ["job", 0.009900990099009901], ["wanted", 0.009900990099009901], ["language", 0.009900990099009901], ["joke", 0.009900990099009901], ["ill", 0.009900990099009901], ["days", 0.009900990099009901], ["flipped", 0.009900990099009901], ["courtly", 0.009900990099009901], ["place", 0.009900990099009901], ["forgave", 0.009900990099009901], ["asked", 0.009900990099009901], ["wig", 0.009900990099009901], ["family", 0.009900990099009901], ["manners", 0.009900990099009901], ["son", 0.009900990099009901], ["hospice", 0.009900990099009901], ["extenuating", 0.009900990099009901], ["described", 0.009900990099009901], ["hospital", 0.009900990099009901], ["life", 0.009900990099009901], ["company", 0.009900990099009901], ["exactly", 0.009900990099009901], ["uncle", 0.009900990099009901], ["baby", 0.009900990099009901], ["abject", 0.009900990099009901], ["elegant", 0.009900990099009901], ["work", 0.009900990099009901], ["cat", 0.009900990099009901], ["hilariously", 0.009900990099009901], ["insulted", 0.009900990099009901], ["rerun", 0.009900990099009901], ["making", 0.009900990099009901], ["history", 0.009900990099009901], ["fawkes", 0.009900990099009901], ["high", 0.009900990099009901], ["player", 0.009900990099009901], ["good", 0.009900990099009901], ["restitution", 0.009900990099009901], ["pink", 0.009900990099009901], ["albany", 0.009900990099009901], ["dying", 0.009900990099009901], ["author", 0.009900990099009901], ["compel", 0.009900990099009901], ["write", 0.009900990099009901], ["novels", 0.009900990099009901], ["knew", 0.009900990099009901], ["demanding", 0.009900990099009901], ["deathbed", 0.009900990099009901], ["president", 0.009900990099009901], ["judgment", 0.009900990099009901], ["forever", 0.009900990099009901], ["short", 0.009900990099009901], ["apology", 0.009900990099009901], ["wife", 0.009900990099009901], ["st", 0.009900990099009901], ["time", 0.009900990099009901]], "sentiment": ["Uncle Alex was so insulted that he flipped his wig. He took the letter to a lawyer to find out what legal steps he might take to compel an abject apology from someone high in the company, and to make this cost the author his job. He was going to write to the President of GE, telling him he had an employee who did not know the value of a dollar.\nBefore he could take such steps, though, somebody told him who Guy Fawkes was in history, and where I was, and that the letter was so hilariously grotesque that it had to be a joke from me. He wanted to kill me for making such a fool of him. I don\u2019t think he ever forgave me, although all I intended was that he be tickled pink.\nIf he had sent my letter to General Electric, demanding spiritual restitution, I would have been fired. I don\u2019t know what would then have become of me and my wife and son. Nor would I ever have come upon the material for my novels Player Piano and Cat\u2019s Cradle, and several short s letter. Bernie on his deathbed gave it to me. Otherwise, it would have been lost forever. But there it is.\nTimequake!

You\u2019re the first one to know about it, my boy. But I don\u2019t know why you shouldn\u2019t be.

on. But it had him turn and run instead. His brain was so defective that it had him run right past his car, with Donald loping right behind him\u2014and he crossed the street and climbed an apple tree in the front yard of an empty house belonging to a family which had moved to Alaska.\nSo Donald sat under the tree and barked up at him.\nRobert was up there for an hour, afraid to come down, until Mary, wondering why Donald had been barking so monotonously for so long, came out of her house and rescued him.\nWhen Robert came down, he was nauseated by fear and self-loathing. He actually threw up. After that, and he had spattered his own shoes and pants cuffs, he said snarlingly, \u201cI am not a man. I am simply not a man. I will of course never bother you again. I will never bother any woman ever again.\u201d\nAnd I retell this story of Mary\u2019s at this point because Captain Adolf von Kleist would hold the same low opinion of his worth after churning the ocean to a lather for five nights and days, and failing to find an island of any kind.\nHe was too far north\u2014much too far north. So we were all too far north\u2014much too far north. I wasn\u2019t hungry, of course, and neither was James Wait, who was frozen solid in the meat locker in the galley below. The galley, although stripped of light bulbs and without portholes, could still be illuminated, albeit hellishly, by the heating elements of its electric ovens and stoves.\nYes, and the plumbing was still working, too. There was plenty of water on tap everywhere, both hot and cold.\nSo nobody was thirsty, but everybody was surely ravenous. Kazakh, Selena\u2019s dog, was missing, and I put no star before her name, for Kazakh was dead. The Kanka-bono girls had stolen her while Selena slept, and choked her with their bare hands, and skinned and gutted her with no other tools than their teeth and fingernails. They had roasted her in an oven. Nobody else knew that they had done that yet.\nShe had been consuming her own substance anyway. By the time they killed her, she was skin and bones.\nIf she had made it to Santa Rosalia, she wouldn\u2019t have had much of a future\u2014even in the unlikely event that there had been a male dog there. She had been neutered, after all. All she could have accomplished which might have outlasted her own lifetime would have been to give the furry Akiko, soon to be born, infantile memories of a dog. Under the best of circumstances, Kazakh would not have lived long enough for the other children born on the island to pet her, and to see her wag her tail and so on. They wouldn\u2019t have had her bark to remember, since Kazakh never barked.", 0.05335948773448773], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["private", 0.021834061135371178], ["half",

She asked if I could come to tea in an hour! I said I sure could! My heart was beating like mad!\nShe was only four blocks away\u2014in a palazzo designed for Innocenzo \u201cthe Invisible\u201d de Medici by Leon Battista Alberti in the middle of the fifteenth century. It was a cruciform structure whose four wings abutted on a domed rotunda twelve meters in diameter and in whose walls were half embedded eighteen Corinthian columns four and a half meters high. Above the capitals of the columns was a clerestory, a wall pierced with thirty-six windows. Above this was the dome\u2014on whose underside was an epiphany, God Almighty and Jesus and the Virgin Mary and angels looking down through clouds, painted by Paolo Uccello. The terrazzo floor, its designer unknown, but almost surely a Venetian, was decorated with the backs of peasants planting and harvesting and cooking and baking and making wine and so on.\nThe incomparable Rabo Karabekian is not here demonstrating his connoisseurship nor his Armenian gift for total recall\u2014nor his fluency with the metric system, for that matter. All the information above comes from a brand new book published by Alfred A. Knopf, Incorporated, called Private Art Treasures of Tuscany, with text and photographs by a South Korean political exile named Kim Bum Suk. According to the preface, it was originally Kim Bum Suk\u2019s doctoral thesis for a degree in the history of architecture from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He managed to examine and photograph the interiors of many opulent private homes in and around Florence which few scholars had ever seen, and whose art treasures had never before been photographed by an outsider or noted in any public catalogue.\nAmong these hitherto impenetrable private spaces was, hey presto, the palazzo of Innocenzo \u201cthe Invisible\u201d de Medici, which I myself penetrated thirty-seven years ago.\nThe palazzo and its contents, uninterruptedly private property for five and a half centuries now, remains private property, following the death of my friend, Marilee, Contessa Portomaggiore, who was the person who, according to the book, gave Kim Bum Suk and his camera and his metric measuring instruments the run of the place. Ownership, upon Marilee\u2019s death two years ago, passed on to her late husband\u2019s nearest male blood relative, a second cousin, an automobile dealer in Milan, who sold it at once to an Egyptian man of mystery, believed to be an arms dealer.

Profits that now went to drones and corrupt politicians would go to those who worked, and to the old and the sick and the orphaned. All people who could work would work. There would be only one social class\u2014the working class. Everyone would take turns doing the most unpleasant work, so that a doctor, for example, might be expected to spend a week out of each year as a garbage man. The production of luxury goods would stop until the basic needs of every citizen were met. Health care would be free. Food would be cheap and nourishing and plentiful. Mansions and hotels and office buildings would be turned into small apartments, until everyone was decently housed. Dwellings would be assigned by means of a lottery. There would be no more wars and eventually no more national boundaries, since everyone in the world would belong to the same class with identical interests\u2014the interests of the working class.\nAnd on and on.\nWhat a spellbinder he was!\nMary Kathleen whispered in my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be just like him, Walter.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d I said. I had no intention of trying.\nThe most embarrassing thing to me about this autobiography, surely, is its unbroken chain of proofs that I was never a serious man. I have been in a lot of trouble over the years, but that was all accidental. Never have I risked my life, or even my comfort, in the service of mankind. Shame on me.\nPeople who had heard Kenneth Whistler speak before begged him to tell again about leading the pickets outside Charlestown Prison when Sacco and Vanzetti were executed. And it seems, strange to me now that I have to explain who Sacco and Vanzetti were. I recently asked young Israel Edel at RAMJAC, the former night clerk at the Arapahoe, what he knew about Sacco and Vanzetti, and he told me confidently that they were rich, brilliant thrill-killers from Chicago. He had them confused with Leopold and Loeb.\nWhy should I find this unsettling? When I was a young man, I expected the story of Sacco and Vanzetti to be retold as often and as movingly, to be as irresistible, as the story of Jesus Christ some day. Weren\u2019t modern people, if they were to marvel creatively at their own lifetimes, I thought, entitled to a Passion like Sacco and Vanzetti\u2019s, which ended in an electric chair?\nAs for the last days of Sacco and Vanzetti as a modern Passion: As on Golgotha, three lower-class men were executed at the same time by a state.

On the contrary, the talk, like so many pep talks on the high school level, had been fairly depressing.\nAnd then, as Selma, Big Floyd, and Schroeder shuffled past the glee club, the glee club and the musicians in support of it stood up.\nAt a signal from Helmholtz, there was a brilliant fanfare of brass.\nThe fanfare brought Selma, Big Floyd, and Schroeder to a halt and to startled attention.\nThe fanfare went on and on\u2014intricately.

For a while there, it looked like I was going to have it for the rest of my life. By now it probably can eat broken glass and razor blades.\nThe TB germs which make me cough so much now, though, are pussycats. There are several drugs on the market which they have never learned to handle. The most potent of these was ordered for me weeks ago, and should be arriving from Rochester at any time.

It is becoming ever clearer that the lengths of the lists will be virtually identical! What a coincidence!

It was that side that raised money for the band, that hammered home to the school board, the Parent Teacher Association, Chamber of Commerce, Kiwanis, Rotary, and Lions that the goodness and richness and hope that his band inspired cost money. In his fund-raising harangues, he would recall for his audiences black days for the Lincoln High football team, days when the Lincoln stands had been silent, hurt, and ashamed.\n\u201cHalf-time,\u201d he would murmur, and hang his head.\nHe would twitch a whistle from his pocket and blow a shrill blast. \u201cLincoln High School Ten Square Band!\u201d he\u2019d shout. \u201cForward\u2014harch! Boom! Ta-ta-ta-taaaaaa!\u201d Helmholtz, singing, marching in place, would become flag twirlers, drummers, brasses, woodwinds, glockenspiel and all. By the time he\u2019d marched his one-man band up and down the imaginary football field once, his audience was elated and wringing wet, ready to buy the band anything it wanted.\nBut no matter how much money came in, the band was always without funds. Helmholtz was a spender when it came to band equipment, and was known among rival bandmasters as \u201cThe Plunger\u201d and \u201cDiamond Jim.\u201d\nAmong the many duties of Stewart Haley, Assistant Principal of Lincoln High, was keeping an eye on band finances. Whenever it was necessary for Haley to discuss band finances with Helmholtz, Haley tried to corner the bandmaster where he couldn\u2019t march and swing his arms.\nHelmholtz knew this, and felt trapped when Haley appeared in the door of the bandmaster\u2019s small office, brandishing a bill for ninety-five dollars. Following Haley was a delivery boy from a tailor shop, who carried a suit box under his arm. As Haley closed the office door from inside, Helmholtz hunched over a drawing board, pretending deep concentration.\n\u201cHelmholtz,\u201d said Haley, \u201cI have here an utterly unexpected, utterly unauthorized bill for\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSh!\u201d said Helmholtz. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you in a moment.\u201d He drew a dotted line across a diagram that was already a black thicket of lines. \u201cI\u2019m just putting the finishing touches on the Mother\u2019s Day formation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make an arrow pierce a heart and then spell \u2018Mom.\u2019 It isn\u2019t easy.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet,\u201d said Haley, rattling the bill, \u201cand I\u2019m as fond of mothers as you are, but you\u2019ve just put a ninety-five-dollar arrow through the public treasury.\u201d\nHelmholtz did not look up. \u201cI was going to tell you about it,\u201d he said, drawing another line, \u201cbut what with getting ready for the state band festival and Mother\u2019s Day, it seemed unimportant.

She wanted to light my hurricane lamp again. I wouldn\u2019t let her. \u201cCan you see anything in the dark, with your sunglasses on?\u201d she asked me.\n\u201cThe big show is inside my head,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI can tell fortunes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou want your fortune told?\u201d\n\u201cNot right now,\u201d she said. She went back to the bar, and she and the bartender had some sort of conversation about me, I think. The bartender took several anxious looks in my direction. All he could see were the leaks over my eyes. I did not worry about his asking me to leave the establishment. I had created him, after all. I gave him a name: Harold Newcomb Wilbur. I awarded him the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, the Soldier\u2019s Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, and a Purple Heart with two Oak-Leaf Clusters, which made him the second most decorated veteran in Midland City. I put all his medals under his handkerchiefs in a dresser drawer.\nHe won all those medals in the Second World War, which was staged by robots so that Dwayne Hoover could give a free-willed reaction to such a holocaust. The war was such an extravaganza that there was scarcely a robot anywhere who didn\u2019t have a part to play. Harold Newcomb Wilbur got his medals for killing Japanese, who were yellow robots. They were fueled by rice.\nAnd he went on staring at me, even though I wanted to stop him now. Here was the thing about my control over the characters I created: I could only guide their movements approximately, since they were such big animals. There was inertia to overcome.

this opportunity for world-wide experiments. The whole thing is assumptions, so it won\u2019t hurt anything to assume a few things more. Let\u2019s assume that the Devil is like an epidemic disease, and go to work on him accordingly. Maybe, if we make it impossible for him to find a comfortable place in anybody anywhere, he\u2019ll disappear or die or go to some other planet, or whatever it is the Devil does, if there is a Devil.\u201d\nWe estimated that to equip every man, woman, and child with one of the electric headsets would cost about $20,000,000,000, and about $70,000,000,000 more a year for batteries. As modern wars go, the price was about right. But we soon found that people weren\u2019t inclined to go that high for anything less than killing each other.\nThe Tower of Babel technique, then, seemed the more practical. Talk is cheap. Hence, UNDICO\u2019s first recommendation was that centers be set up all over the world, and that people everywhere be encouraged in one way or another, according to native methods of coercion\u2014an easy buck, or a bayonet, or fear of damnation\u2014to come regularly to these centers to unburden themselves about childhood and sex.\nResponse to this first recommendation, this first sign that UNDICO was really going to go after the Devil in a businesslike fashion, revealed a deep undercurrent of uneasiness in the flood of enthusiasm. There was hedging on the part of many leaders, and vague objections were raised in fuzzy terms like \u201crunning counter to our great national heritage for which our forefathers sacrificed unflinchingly at\u2026\u201d No one was imprudent enough to want to seem a protector of the Devil, but, all the same, the kind of caution recommended by many in high places bore a strong resemblance to complete inaction.\nAt first, Dr. Tarbell thought the reaction was due to fear\u2014fear of the Devil\u2019s retaliation for the war we wanted to make on him. Later, after he\u2019d had time to study the opposition\u2019s membership and statements, he said gleefully, \u201cBy golly, they think we\u2019ve got a chance. And they\u2019re all scared stiff they won\u2019t have a chance of being so much as a dogcatcher if the Devil isn\u2019t at large in the populace.\u201d\nBut, as I said, we felt that we had less than a chance in a trillion of changing the world much more than one whit. Thanks to an accident and the undercurrent of opposition, the odds soon jumped to an octillion to one.\nShortly after the Committee\u2019s first recommendation, the accident happened. \u201cAny fool knows the quick and easy way to get rid of the Devil,\u201d whispered one American delegate to another one in the U.N. General Assembly. \u201cNothing to it. Just blow him to hell in his headquarters in the Kremlin.\u201d He couldn\u2019t have been more mistaken in thinking the microphone before him was dead.\nHis comment was carried over the public address system, and was dutifully translated into fourteen languages. The Russian delegation walked out, and telegraphed home for a suitable reaction. Two hours later, they were back with a statement:\n\u201cThe people of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics hereby withdraw all support of the United Nations Demonological Investigating Committee as being an internal affair of the United States of America. Russian scientists are in full agreement with the findings of the Pine Institute as to the presence of the Devil throughout the United States. Using the same experimental techniques, these scientists have found no signs whatsoever of the Devil\u2019s activities within the boundaries of the U.S.S.R., and, hence, consider the problem as being uniquely American. The people of the U.S.S.R. wish the people of the United States of America success in their difficult enterprise, that they may all the sooner be ready for full membership in the family of friendly nations.\u201d\nIn America, the instant reaction was to declare that any effort on UNDICO\u2019s part in this country would mean a further propaganda victory for Russia. Other nations followed suit, declaring themselves to be already Devil-free. And that was that for UNDICO. Frankly, I was relieved and delighted. UNDICO was beginning to look like a real headache.", 0.14297954393024814], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
