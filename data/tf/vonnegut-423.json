As I wrote for his memorial service: \u201cWe had both been infantry privates in combat in Europe during World War Two. When we met, coming to work at General Electric soon afterwards, bingo! Love at first sight!\u201d\nMy love to you and Maggie as well\u2014\nKV\nApril 19, 2005\n[New York City]\nTO ROBERT MASLANSKY\nDear Dr. Maslansky:\nFind enclosed your short story \u201cIncident on a Hill,\u201d of which I have read every word.\nListen: Story-telling is a game for two, and a mature story-teller, which you are not, is sociable, a good date on a blind date with a total stranger, so to speak. In this story, you are obviously unconcerned as to whether the reader is having a good time or not, or even whether he or she has a clue as to what in hell or where in hell you\u2019re talking about. If this is Korea fifty years ago, why couldn\u2019t you say so? Talk about being anal-retentive!", 0.20254329004329003], "title": "Letters"}}
