And I cried on your shoulder about my not belonging to any class, like Karl Marx. Well, I was wrong. I belong to the Class of \u201944, and I\u2019ve been asked to come back.\nEven though Cornell, in 1942, refused to give me a certificate stating that I had left the place under no cloud to go to war. It was their contention that I had left under a cloud.\nAnd guess who\u2019s turned out to be such a wonderful writer that he\u2019s been tapped to write a book about Cornell?\nI haven\u2019t decided yet whether I\u2019m going to be nice about it or not. No matter what I do, there\u2019ll be plenty going on inside their heads, you can bet. What I represent is a challenge to the ivory tower, to the whole system of academic testing and evaluation\u2014and I don\u2019t see how any of them can miss that.\nI\u2019m not going to the reunion, in the costume and levy-paying sense. I may be in the neighborhood, and I may drop in. But I refuse to be a member of \u201944.\nIncidentally, did you know that Chrysler has in fact been badly hurt? Only 16% of the market remains to them, and their used cars are drugs on the market. There\u2019s something you\u2019re supposed to do to make money out of a stock when you know it\u2019s going down, but I forget what it is. Miller told me once. Put and call, I think. But it\u2019s pretty special, and there\u2019s a good chance somebody besides Chrysler will get badly hurt.\nAs Gabriel Heatter said last night, in considering the McCarthy\u2013Army hearings, \u201cIt\u2019s out of hand. Somebody\u2019s going to get hurt.\u201d I think he\u2019s dead right\u2014and nothing\u2019s ever made the validity of tragedy clearer to me. Nobody can extricate himself. Nobody can stop being himself. And it all adds up to a great, grinding, merciless engine.\nLovely. The mechanics are lovely, that is. It doesn\u2019t hit me here, in the heart. And neither does the 3:59.4 mile.\nBut the fall of Dien Bien Phu does. That just about broke my heart, and filled me full of all kinds of primitive feelings\u2014one being that that\u2019s the way to go; another being that I wouldn\u2019t mind too much getting into a rifle and grenade fight in some clean, dry, sunny place near a first-class hospital.", 0.13710317460317462], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["second", 0.01875], ["war", 0.01875], ["supposed", 0.01875], ["battlefield", 0.0125], ["killing", 0.0125], ["country", 0.0125], ["awarded", 0.0125], ["hitler", 0.0125], ["bingo", 0.0125], ["criminals", 0.0125], ["three", 0.0125], ["decoration", 0.0125], ["summer", 0.00625], ["excessive", 0.00625], ["help", 0.00625], ["quoted", 0.00625], ["protest", 0.00625], ["questions", 0.00625], ["participate", 0.00625], ["hell", 0.00625], ["clapped", 0.00625], ["psychopathic", 0.00625], ["suicide", 0.00625], ["ell", 0.00625], ["hadn", 0.00625], ["botched", 0.00625], ["coordinates", 0.00625], ["winning", 0.00625], ["harmless", 0.00625], ["civilization", 0.00625], ["good", 0.00625], ["big", 0.00625], ["kindling", 0.00625], ["continues", 0.00625], ["interior", 0.00625], ["game", 0.00625], ["scout", 0.00625], ["jesus", 0.00625], ["dr", 0.00625], ["classifiable", 0.00625], ["calling", 0.00625], ["fairs", 0.00625], ["nazis", 0.00625], ["side", 0.00625], ["brave", 0.00625], ["human", 0.00625], ["dump", 0.00625], ["people", 0.00625], ["intelligence", 0.00625], ["unsuccessful", 0.00625], ["ted", 0.00625], ["alive", 0.00625], ["dear", 0.00625], ["enemies", 0.00625], ["christ", 0.00625], ["purple", 0.00625], ["arguably", 0.00625], ["won", 0.00625], ["messenger", 0.00625], ["squares", 0.00625], ["demonstrated", 0.00625], ["told", 0.00625], ["fearlessness", 0.00625], ["corporal", 0.00625], ["wears", 0.00625], ["sheetrock", 0.00625], ["wasn", 0.00625], ["step", 0.00625], ["concentrate", 0.00625], ["wear", 0.00625], ["losing", 0.00625], ["wanted", 0.00625], ["shot", 0.00625], ["thirty", 0.00625], ["watercolorist", 0.00625], ["favorite", 0.00625], ["players", 0.00625], ["pediatrician", 0.00625], ["bunker", 0.00625], ["superiors", 0.00625], ["history", 0.00625], ["asked", 0.00625], ["unnoticed", 0.00625], ["hemingway", 0.00625], ["son", 0.00625], ["feet", 0.00625], ["western", 0.00625], ["church", 0.00625], ["remains", 0.00625], ["wintertime", 0.00625], ["question", 0.00625], ["mark", 0.00625], ["going", 0.00625], ["lot", 0.00625], ["analgesic", 0.00625], ["bite", 0.00625], ["lowest", 0.00625], ["pfc", 0.00625], ["frost", 0.00625], ["finished", 0.00625], ["uncle", 0.00625], ["pediatricians", 0.00625], ["highest", 0.00625], ["effort", 0.00625], ["kind", 0.00625], ["third", 0.00625], ["places", 0.00625], ["1996", 0.00625], ["doodoo", 0.00625], ["fight", 0.00625], ["trick", 0.00625], ["sax", 0.00625], ["iron", 0.00625], ["cards", 0.00625], ["ernest", 0.00625], ["reconnaissance", 0.00625], ["propaganda", 0.00625], ["biddies", 0.00625], ["heart", 0.00625], ["deep", 0.00625], ["player", 0.00625], ["bellowed", 0.00625], ["proves", 0.00625], ["exterior", 0.00625], ["occupied", 0.00625], ["thing", 0.00625], ["cross", 0.00625], ["book", 0.00625], ["vonnegut", 0.00625], ["scraps", 0.00625], ["party", 0.00625], ["dan", 0.00625], ["stand", 0.00625], ["advice", 0.00625], ["stay", 0.00625], ["commit", 0.00625], ["communicator", 0.00625], ["germans", 0.00625], ["man", 0.00625], ["attempt", 0.00625], ["effective", 0.00625], ["looked", 0.00625], ["quotations", 0.00625], ["painting", 0.00625], ["minister", 0.00625]], "sentiment": ["The Sheetrock was the last step. I myself would do the exterior and interior painting. I told Ted I wanted to do at least that much, or he would have done that, too. When he himself had finished, and he had taken all the scraps I , didn\u2019t want for kindling to the dump, he had me stand next to him outside and look at my new ell from thirty feet away.\nAnd then he asked it: \u201cHow the hell did I do that?\u201d\nThat question remains for me in the summer of 1996 one of my three favorite quotations. Two of the three are questions rather than good advice of any kind. The second is Jesus Christ\u2019s \u201cWho is it they say I am?\u201d\nThe third is from my son Mark, pediatrician and watercolorist and sax player. I\u2019ve already quoted him in another book: \u201cWe are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.\u201d\nOne might protest, \u201cMy dear Dr. Vonnegut, we can\u2019t all be pediatricians.\u201d\nIn \u201cBunker Bingo Party,\u201d the Nazis participate in Bingo, with the Minister of Propaganda, arguably the most effective communicator in history, calling out the coordinates of winning or losing squares on the players\u2019 cards. The game proves as analgesic for war criminals in deep doodoo as it continues to be for harmless old biddies at church fairs.\nSeveral of the war criminals wear an Iron Cross, awarded only to Germans who have demonstrated battlefield fearlessness so excessive as to be classifiable as psychopathic. Hitler wears one. He won it as a corporal in Western Civilization\u2019s first unsuccessful attempt to commit suicide.\nI was a PFC during the second botched effort to end it all. Like Ernest Hemingway, I never shot a human being. Maybe Hitler never did that big trick, either. He didn\u2019t get his country\u2019s highest decoration for killing a lot of people.

I applied, I think, simply to demonstrate to myself that there really was such a person as me.\nThe application form I filled out was necessarily full of lies, was such a fabric of mendacity that the school did not even bother to tell me that I was unacceptable.

Fern turned away from the window. His face was a troubling combination of youth and age. There was no sign in the face of any intermediate stages in the aging process, no hint of the man of thirty or forty or fifty who had been left behind. Only adolescence and the age of sixty were represented. It was as though a seventeen-year-old had been withered and bleached by a blast of heat.\nFern read two books a day. It has been said that Aristotle was the last man to be familiar with the whole of his own culture. Ransom K. Fern had made an impressive attempt to equal Aristotle\u2019s achievement. He had been somewhat less successful than Aristotle in perceiving patterns in what he knew.\nThe intellectual mountain had labored to produce a philosophical mouse\u2014and Fern was the first to admit that it was a mouse, and a mangy mouse at that.

After a while, we could hear these cooking sounds. It was a lot like cooking a turkey. In utter safety, I think, we could have opened the breechblock from time to time, and basted the shell. Eventually, though, the howitzer always got restless. And finally it would heave back on its recoil mechanism, and it would have to expectorate the shell. The shell would come floating out like the Goodyear blimp. If we had had a stepladder, we could have painted \u201cFuck Hider\u201d on the shell as it left the gun.

There is no outside here. To pass through the gates in either direction is to go from nowhere to nowhere and from everywhere to everywhere. Imagine a billiard table as long and broad as the Milky Way. Do not omit the detail of its being a flawless slate slab to which green felt has been glued. Imagine a gate at dead center on the slab. Anyone imagining that much will have comprehended all there is to know about Paradise\u2014and will have sympathized with those becoming ravenous for the distinction between inside and outside.\nUncomfortable as it is here, however, there are a few of us who do not care to be reborn. I am among that number. I have not been on Earth since 1587 A.D., when, riding around in the meat of one Walpurga Hausm\u00e4nnin, I was executed in the Austrian village of Dillingen. The alleged crime of my meat was witch-craft. When I heard the sentence, I certainly wanted out of that meat. I was about to leave it anyway, having worn it for more than eighty-five years. But I had to stay right with it when they tied it astride a sawhorse, put the sawhorse on a cart, took my poor old meat to the Town Hall. There they tore my right arm and left breast with red-hot pincers. Then we went to the lower gate, where they tore my right breast. Then they took me to the door of the hospital, where they tore my right arm. And then they took me to the village square. In view of the fact that I had been a licensed and pledged midwife for sixty-two years, and yet had acted so vilely, they cut off my right hand. And then they tied me to a stake, burned me alive, and dumped my ashes into the nearest stream.\nAs I say, I haven't been back since.\nIt used to be that most of us who didn't want to go back to good old Earth were souls whose meat had been tortured in slow and fancy ways\u2014a fact that should make very smug indeed proponents of corporal and capital punishments and deterrents to crime. But something curious has been happening of late. We have been gaining recruits to whom, by our standards of agony, practically nothing happened on Earth. They scarcely barked a shin down there, and yet they arrive up here in shell-shocked battalions, bawling, \"Never again!\"\n\"Who are these people?\" I ask myself. \"What is this unimaginably horrible thing that has happened to them?\" And I realized that, in order to get proper answers, I am going to have to cease to be dead. I am going to have to let myself be reborn.\nWord has just come that I am to be sent where the soul of Richard the Lion Hearted now lives, Rosewater, Indiana.\nEliot's black telephone rang.\n\"This is the Rosewater Foundation. How can we help you?\"\n\"Mr. Rosewater\u2014\" said a woman chockingly, \"this\u2014this is Stella Wakeby.\" She panted, waiting for his reaction to the announcement.\n\"Well!

It was an illegal campaign contribution. It became necessary to hide it when the contents of all White House safes were to be examined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and men from the Office of the Special Prosecutor. My obscure office in the subbasement was selected as the most promising hiding place. I acquiesced.\nSomewhere in there my wife died.\nAnd then the trunk was found. The police came for me. I knew the people who brought the trunk to my office, and under whose orders they were operating. They were all high-ranking people, some of them laboring like common stevedores. I would not tell the court or my own lawyers or anyone who they were. Thus did I go to prison for a while.\nI had learned this much from my mutual disaster with Leland Clewes: It was sickening to send another poor fool to prison. There was nothing quite like sworn testimony to make life look trivial and mean ever after.\nAlso: My wife had just died. I could not care what happened next. I was a zombie.\nEven now I will not name the malefactors with the trunk. It does not matter.\nI cannot, however, withhold from American history what one of the malefactors said after the trunk was set down in my office.

He went to look for a screwdriver.\n\u201cMr. Luby?\u201d said Harve, puzzled, polite. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d said Luby. \u201cI\u2019m the one who oughta be asking what\u2019s going on.\u201d He still looked at the knocker rather than at Harve and Claire. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea?\u201d he said. \u201cHalloween or something? Tonight\u2019s the night people put on funny costumes and go knock on private doors till the people inside go nuts?\u201d\nThe crack about funny costumes was obviously meant to hit Claire Elliot squarely\u2014and it did. Claire was vulnerable\u2014not because she looked funny, but because she had made the dress she wore, because her fur coat was borrowed. Claire looked marvelous, as a matter of fact, looked marvelous to anyone with an eye for beauty, beauty that had been touched by life. Claire was still slender, affectionate, tremendously optimistic. What time and work and worry had done to her was to make her look, permanently, the least bit tired.\nHarve Elliot didn\u2019t react very fast to Luby\u2019s crack. The anniversary mood was still upon Harve. All anxieties, all expectations of meanness were still suspended. Harve wasn\u2019t going to pay any attention to anything but pleasure. He simply wanted to get inside, where the music and the food and the good drinks were.", 0.09783790283790285], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["mother",

It cost more than my annual salary at Tarkington. The car was a gift from the mother of a student of mine named Pierre LeGrand. His maternal grandfather had been dictator of Haiti, and had taken the treasury of that country with him when he was overthrown. That was why Pierre\u2019s mother was so rich. He was very unpopular. He tried to win friends by making expensive gifts to them, but that didn\u2019t work, so he tried to hang himself from a girder of the water tower on top of Musket Mountain. I happened to be up there, in the bushes with the wife of the coach of the Tennis Team.\nSo I cut him down with my Swiss Army knife. That was how I got the Mercedes.\nPierre would have better luck 2 years later, jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, and a campus joke was that now I had to give the Mercedes back.\nSo there were plenty of heartaches in what, as I\u2019ve said, must have looked to those 3 convicts like Paradise. There was no way they could tell that my mother-in-law was as crazy as a bedbug, as long as she kept her back to them. They could not know, and neither could I, of course, that hereditary insanity would hit my pretty wife like a ton of bricks in about 6 months\u2019 time and turn her into a hag as scary as her mother.\nIF WE HAD had our 2 kids with us on the beach, that would have completed the illusion that we lived in Paradise. They could have depicted another generation that found life as comfortable as we did. Both sexes would have been represented. We had a girl named Melanie and a boy named Eugene Debs Hartke, Jr. But they weren\u2019t kids anymore. Melanie was 21, and studying mathematics at Cambridge University in England. Eugene Jr. was completing his senior year at Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts, and was 18, and had his own rock-and-roll band, and had composed maybe 100 songs by then.\nBut Melanie would have spoiled our tableau on the beach. Like my mother until she went to Weight Watchers, she was very heavy. That must be hereditary. If she had kept her back to the convicts, she might at least have concealed the fact that she had a bulbous nose like the late, great, alcoholic comedian W. C. Fields. Melanie, thank goodness, was not also an alcoholic.\nBut her brother was.\nAnd I could kill myself now for having boasted to him that on my side of the family the men had no fear of alcohol, since they knew how to drink in moderation. We were not weak and foolish where drugs were concerned.\nAT LEAST EUGENE Jr. was beautiful, having inherited the features of his mother.

Kleinhans\u2019 terrible swift sword.\n\u201cThe Articles of the Geneva Convention say privates must work for their keep. Work!\u201d said Corporal Kleinhans. He kept them sweating and grunting all afternoon. He barked an order the instant any of the three showed an inclination to speak. \u201cYou! Donnini! Here, pick up this bowl of spaghetti,\u201d he said, indicating a huge boulder with the tip of his toe. He strode over to a pair of twelve-by-twelve rafters lying across the street. \u201cKniptash and Coleman, my boys,\u201d he crooned, clapping his hands, \u201chere are those chocolate \u00e9clairs you\u2019ve been dreaming about. One for each of you.\u201d He placed his face an inch from Coleman\u2019s. \u201cWith whipped cream,\u201d he whispered.\nIt was a genuinely glum crew that shambled into the prison enclosure that evening. Before, Donnini, Kniptash, and Coleman had made a point of half limping in, as though beaten down by terribly hard labor and unrelenting discipline. Kleinhans, in turn, had made a fine spectacle, snapping at them like a bad-tempered sheep dog as they stumbled through the gate. Now, their semblance was as before, but the tragedy they portrayed was real.\nKleinhans jerked open the barracks door, and motioned them in with an imperious sweep of his hand.\n\u201cAchtung!\u201d cried a high voice from within. Donnini, Coleman, and Kniptash halted and slouched, their heels more or less together. With a crackle of leather and the clack of heels, Corporal Kleinhans slammed his rifle butt on the floor, and stood as erect as his old back would permit, trembling. A surprise inspection by a German officer was under way. Once a month they could expect one. A short colonel in a fur-collared coat and black boots was standing, his feet far apart, before a rank of prisoners. Beside him was the fat sergeant of the guard. All stared at Corporal Kleinhans and his charges.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the colonel in German, \u201cwhat have we here?\u201d\nThe sergeant hurriedly explained with gestures, his brown eyes pleading for approval.\nThe colonel walked slowly across the cement floor, his hands clasped behind his back. He paused before Kniptash. \u201cYou pin a pad poy, eh?\u201d\n\u201cYessir, I have,\u201d said Kniptash simply.\n\u201cYou sorry now?\u201d", -0.06425213675213674], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
