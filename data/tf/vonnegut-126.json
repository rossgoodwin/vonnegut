Lawrence had been editor of the literary magazine Wake at Harvard, worked for a year as a book salesman to learn the business, became director of The Atlantic Monthly Press at age twenty-nine and an editor of the Atlantic Press, where he brought in Katherine Anne Porter\u2019s Ship of Fools for Atlantic/Little Brown; disgruntled that he didn\u2019t get a share of that bestseller\u2019s earnings for his efforts, he left the company. He briefly became a vice president of Knopf but was dissatisfied with working more with contracts than with authors, so he started his own company in a one-room office on Beacon Street in Boston in 1966.\nHe wrote to Vonnegut out of admiration for his New York Times review of the Random House dictionary.\nDear Mr. Lawrence:", 0.18630050505050505], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf":

at the clambake were five men half my age who made me want to keep on going in my sunset years because of their interest in my work. They weren\u2019t there to see me. They wanted at long last to meet Kilgore Trout. They were Robert Weide, who in this summer of 1996 is making a movie in Montreal of Mother Night, and Marc Leeds, who wrote and had published a witty encyclopedia of my life and work, and Asa Pieratt and Jerome Klinkowitz, who have kept my bibliography up-to-date and written essays about me as well, and Joe Petro III, numbered like a World War, who taught me how to silk-screen.\nMy closest business associate, Don Farber, lawyer and agent, was there with his dear wife, Anne. My closest social pal, Sidney Offit, was there. The critic John Leonard was there, and the academicians Peter Reed and Loree Rackstraw, and the photographer Cliff McCarthy, and other kind strangers too numerous to mention.\nThe professional actors Kevin McCarthy and Nick Nolte were there.\nMy children and grandchildren weren\u2019t there. That was OK, perfectly understandable. It wasn\u2019t my birthday, and I wasn\u2019t a guest of honor. The heroes that evening were Frank Smith and Kilgore Trout. My kids and my kids\u2019 kids had other fish to fry. Perhaps I should say my kids and my kids\u2019 kids had other lobsters and clams and oysters and potatoes and corn on the cob to steam in seaweed.\nWhatever!\nGet it right! Remember Uncle Carl Barus, and get it right!\n63\nThis is not a Gothic novel. My late friend Borden Deal, a first-rate southern novelist, so southern he asked his publishers not to send review copies north of the Mason-Dixon line, also wrote Gothic novels under a feminine nom de plume. I asked him for a definition of a Gothic novel. He said, \u201cA young woman goes into an old house and gets her pants scared off.\u201d\nBorden and I were in Vienna, Austria, for a congress of PEN, the international writers\u2019 organization founded after World War One, when he told me that. We went on to talk about the German novelist Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, who in print found humiliation and pain so delectable at the end of the previous century. Because of him, modern languages have the word masochism.\nBorden not only wrote serious novels and Gothics. He wrote country music. He had his guitar back in his hotel room, and was working, he said, on a song called \u201cI Never Waltzed in Vienna.\u201d I miss him.

Tiger, who had been a year ahead of Felix in high school, had taken her out once, which was par for the course. He guessed that she was lucky to have married an automobile dealer who didn\u2019t care what was under her hood.\n\u201cA cream puff,\u201d he said. At that time, this was a common description for an automobile which was flashy and loaded with accessories\u2014and never mind whether it ran or not.\nHe had one interesting piece of information, which I had also heard: that the place to see Celia was at the YMCA at night, where she was enrolled in several self-improvement programs\u2014calligraphy and modern dance and business law, and things like that. This had been going on for a couple of years or more.\nFelix, hunching forward, asked Adams how Dwayne Hoover took it, having his wife go off night after night. And Adams replied that Dwayne had probably given up interesting her in sex. It was a futile undertaking. Dwayne was consoling himself, no doubt, in somebody else\u2019s arms.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s probably a chore for him,\u201d Adams went on, \u201clike having his teeth cleaned.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s something everybody should do at least twice a year,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSome sexy town,\u201d said Felix.\n\u201cSome towns had better pay attention to business,\u201d said Adams. \u201cIt would be a terrible thing for the country if they were all like Hollywood and New York.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd after we set down on the one runway that was open at Cincinnati, it was evident to me that the runway had been cleared at great expense and just for us. That was how important Fred T. Barry was. It turned out that he was on an emergency mission, although he and his mother had said nothing about that to us. The Air Force was deeply concerned about sensitive work that Barrytron was doing for them.

"sentiment": ["\u201cTherefore, I take it upon myself to pronounce those about to graduate women and men. No one must ever treat them like children again. Neither must they ever act like children\u2014ever again.\n\u201cThis is what is known as a puberty ceremony.\n\u201cI realize that it is coming a little late, but better late than never. Every primitive society ever studied has had a puberty ceremony, at which former children became unchallengeably women and men. Some Jewish communities still honor this old practice, of course, and benefit from it, in my opinion. But, by and large, ultramodern, massively industrialized societies like ours have decided to do without puberty ceremonies\u2014unless you want to count the issuance of driver\u2019s licenses at the age of sixteen. If you want to count that as a puberty ceremony, then it has a highly unusual feature: a judge can take your puberty away again, even if you\u2019re fifty-six, like me.\n\u201cAnother event in the lives of American and European males which might be considered a puberty ceremony is war. If a male comes home from a war, especially with serious wounds, everybody agrees: Here indeed is a man. When I came home to Indianapolis from the Second World War in Germany, an uncle of mine said to me, \u2019By golly\u2014you look like a man now.\u2019 I wanted to strangle him. If I had, he would have been the first German I\u2019d killed. I was a man before I went to war, but he was damned if he would say so.\n\u201cI suggest to you that the withholding of a puberty ceremony from young males in our society is a scheme, devised cunningly but subconsciously, to make those males eager to go to war, no matter how terrible or unjust a war may be. There are just wars, too, of course. The war I was eager to go to happened to be a just one.\n\u201cAnd when does a female stop being a little girl and become a woman, with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto? We all know the answer in our bones: when she has a baby in wedlock, of course. If she has that first baby out of wedlock, she is still a child. What could be simpler or more natural and more obvious than that\u2014or, in these days and in this society, at least, more unjust, irrelevant, and just plain stupid?\n\u201cI think we had better, for our own safety, reinstate puberty ceremonies.\n\u201cI not only declare those about to graduate women and men. With all the powers vested in me, I pronounce them clarks, as well. Most of you know, I\u2019m sure, that all white people named Clark are descended from inhabitants of the British Isles who were remarkable for being able to read and write. A black person named Clark, of course, would be descended, most likely, from someone who was forced to work without pay or rights of any kind by a white person named Clark. An interesting family\u2014the Clarks.\n\u201cI realize that you graduaters are all specialized in some way. But you have spent most of the past sixteen or more years learning to read and write. People who can read and write expertly, as you can, are miracles and, in my opinion, entitle us to suspect that we may be civilized after all. It is terribly hard to learn to read and write. It takes forever. When we scold our schoolteachers about the low reading scores of their students, we pretend that it is the easiest thing in the world: to teach a person to read and write. Try it sometime, and you will discover that it is nearly impossible.\n\u201cWhat good is being a dark, now that we have computers and movies and television? Clarking, a wholly human enterprise, is sacred. Machinery is not. Clarking is the most profound and effective form of meditation practiced on this planet, and far surpasses any dream experienced by a Hindu on a mountaintop. Why? Because clarks, by reading well, can think the thoughts of the wisest and most interesting human minds throughout all history. When clarks meditate, even if they themselves have only mediocre intellects, they do it with the thoughts of angels.

The truth was that she was only in her middle forties when they started to come, and the sunset of her life was still far away. She had all of her teeth and needed her steel-rimmed spectacles only for reading.\nShe felt old because her husband, Ed, who really was old, had died and left her alone on the hog farm in northern Indiana. When Ed died, she had sold the livestock, rented the flat, black, rich land to neighbors, read her Bible, watered her houseplants, fed her chickens, tended her small vegetable garden, or simply rocked\u2014waiting patiently and without rancor for the Bright Angel of Death. Ed had left her plenty of money, so she wasn\u2019t goaded into doing anything more, and the people in the area, the only area Annie knew, made her feel that she was doing the right thing, the customary thing, the only thing.\nThough she was without relatives, she wasn\u2019t without callers.

Nobody will even speak to me.\u201d\nShe asked me if I had seen any acts of kindness anywhere. I reflected on this and I realized that I had encountered almost nothing but kindness since leaving prison. I told her so.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s the way I look,\u201d she said. This was surely so. There was a limit to how much reproachful ugliness most people could bear to look at, and Mary Kathleen and all her shopping-bag sisters had exceeded that limit.\nShe was eager to know about individual acts of kindness toward me, to have it confirmed that Americans could still be good-hearted. So I was glad to tell her about my first twenty-four hours as a free man, starting with the kindness shown to me by Clyde Carter, the guard, and then by Dr. Robert Fender, the supply clerk and science-fiction writer. After that, of course, I was given a ride in a limousine by Cleveland Lawes.\nMary Kathleen exclaimed over these people, repeated their names to make sure she had them right. \u201cThey\u2019re saints!\u201d she said. \u201cSo there are still saints around!\u201d\nThus encouraged, I embroidered on the hospitality offered to me by Dr. Israel Edel, the night clerk at the Arapahoe, and then by the employees at the Coffee Shop of the Hotel Royalton on the following morning.

This wonder was a regular stop on the tours Halyard conducted for a bizarre variety of foreign potentates, whose common denominator was that their people represented untapped markets for America\u2019s stupendous industrial output.\nA rubber-wheeled electric car came to a stop by the elevator, where the Shah\u2019s party stood, and an Army major, armed with a pistol, dismounted and examined their credentials slowly, thoroughly.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t we speed this up a little, Major?\u201d said Halyard. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to miss the ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said the major. \u201cBut, as officer of the day, I\u2019m responsible for nine billion dollars worth of government property, and if something should happen to it somebody might be rather annoyed with me. The ceremony has been delayed, anyway, so you won\u2019t miss anything. The President hasn\u2019t showed up yet.\u201d\nThe major was satisfied at last, and the party boarded the open vehicle.", 0.08909443269908388], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["big", 0.05555555555555555], ["helmholtz", 0.046296296296296294], ["selma", 0.046296296296296294], ["floyd", 0.046296296296296294], ["groper", 0.037037037037037035], ["schroeder", 0.037037037037037035], ["cafeteria", 0.027777777777777776], ["ritter", 0.018518518518518517], ["sitting", 0.018518518518518517], ["eldred", 0.018518518518518517], ["crane", 0.018518518518518517], ["thing", 0.018518518518518517], ["popular", 0.018518518518518517], ["wonderingly", 0.009259259259259259], ["bars", 0.009259259259259259], ["love", 0.009259259259259259], ["help", 0.009259259259259259], ["office", 0.009259259259259259], ["plate", 0.009259259259259259], ["imaginary", 0.009259259259259259], ["ruefully", 0.009259259259259259], ["manage", 0.009259259259259259], ["period", 0.009259259259259259], ["remembered", 0.009259259259259259], ["shuddered", 0.009259259259259259], ["separated", 0.009259259259259259], ["file", 0.009259259259259259], ["small", 0.009259259259259259], ["happen", 0.009259259259259259], ["find", 0.009259259259259259], ["principal", 0.009259259259259259], ["looked", 0.009259259259259259], ["resigned", 0.009259259259259259], ["hal", 0.009259259259259259], ["thinking", 0.009259259259259259], ["quizzically", 0.009259259259259259], ["hopeful", 0.009259259259259259], ["george", 0.009259259259259259], ["students", 0.009259259259259259], ["squirmed", 0.009259259259259259], ["going", 0.009259259259259259], ["department", 0.009259259259259259], ["scowled", 0.009259259259259259], ["massive", 0.009259259259259259], ["real", 0.009259259259259259], ["wouldn", 0.009259259259259259], ["head", 0.009259259259259259], ["affair", 0.009259259259259259], ["confidential", 0.009259259259259259], ["depress", 0.009259259259259259], ["prodigiously", 0.009259259259259259], ["bourbeau", 0.009259259259259259], ["lunch", 0.009259259259259259], ["glass", 0.009259259259259259], ["inexpressibly", 0.009259259259259259], ["bent", 0.009259259259259259], ["student", 0.009259259259259259], ["scanning", 0.009259259259259259], ["eats", 0.009259259259259259], ["nodded", 0.009259259259259259], ["eat", 0.009259259259259259], ["pull", 0.009259259259259259], ["thrill", 0.009259259259259259], ["hour", 0.009259259259259259], ["inarticulate", 0.009259259259259259], ["brilliant", 0.009259259259259259], ["shy", 0.009259259259259259], ["boy", 0.009259259259259259], ["partition", 0.009259259259259259], ["dejected", 0.009259259259259259], ["quiet", 0.009259259259259259], ["face", 0.009259259259259259], ["thought", 0.009259259259259259], ["regular", 0.009259259259259259], ["teachers", 0.009259259259259259], ["iron", 0.009259259259259259], ["english", 0.009259259259259259]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI thought Schroeder might help to pull Big Floyd and Selma up,\u201d said Groper.

man down in Scipio. The Provost wished that he or somebody knew the name of the man, so that the police could question him.\nIn another story, Barber told a reporter that he had planned to take his family to Europe that summer but would stay in Scipio instead, in order to do all he could to clear up the mystery of what had become of Letitia Smiley. Such dedication to duty!\nHe had a wife and 2 kids, and he sent them to Europe without him. Since the campus was virtually deserted in the summertime, except for the maintenance staff, which took orders from him, he could easily have ensured his own privacy by sending the workmen to another part of the campus while he buried small parts of Letitia, possibly using a posthole digger.\nI HAVE TO wonder, too, in light of my own experiences in public-relations hocus pocus and the recent history of my Government, if there weren\u2019t a lot of people back in 1922 who could put 2 and 2 together as easily as I have now. For the sake of the reputation of what had become Scipio\u2019s principal business, the college, there could have been a massive cover-up.\nKensington Barber would have a nervous breakdown at the end of the summer, and be committed, as I\u2019ve said, to Batavia. The President of Tarkington at that time, who was Herbert Van Arsdale, no relation to Whitey VanArsdale, the dishonest mechanic, ascribed the Provost\u2019s crackup to exhaustion brought on by his tireless efforts to solve the mystery of the disappearance of the golden-haired Lilac Queen.\n25\nMY LAWYER FOUND only one thing really interesting in my theory about the Lilac Queen, and that was about the broad purple hair ribbons worn by all the girls in that footrace, right up to the last race before the prison break. The escaped convicts discovered spools and spools of that ribbon in a closet in the office of the Dean of Women. Alton Darwin had them cut it up into armbands as a sort of uniform, a quick way to tell friend from foe. Of course, skin color already did a pretty good job of that.\nThe significance of the purple armbands, my lawyer says, is that I never put one on. This would help to prove that I was truly neutral.\nTHE CONVICTS DIDN\u2019T create a new flag. They flew the Stars and Stripes from the bell tower.

If you will look just below the eagle, you will find that the oak leaf in the ornamentation can be pressed in and turned. Turn it so that the stem points up at the eagle\u2019s left claw. Then, press down on the acorn just above the eagle, and\u2026\u201d\nAs he read, I followed my own directions. I pressed on the leaf and turned it, and there was a click. I pushed the acorn with my thumb, and the front of a small drawer popped out a fraction of an inch, just enough to let a person get a grip on it and pull it out the rest of the way.\n\u201cSeems to be stuck,\u201d I said. I reached up under the desk, and snipped a strand of piano wire hooked to the back of the drawer. \u201cThere!\u201d I pulled the drawer out the rest of the way. \u201cYou see?\u201d\nCaptain Donnini laughed. \u201cMajor Evans would have loved it. Wonderful!\u201d Appreciatively, he slid the drawer back and forth several times, wondering at how its front blended so perfectly with the ornamentation. \u201cMakes me wish I had secrets.\u201d\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many people in Europe without them,\u201d I said. He turned his back for a moment. I reached under the commandant\u2019s desk again, slipped a pin into the detonator, and removed the bomb.\nArmageddon in Retrospect\nDear Friend:\nMay I have a minute of your time? We have never met, but I am taking the liberty of writing to you because a mutual friend has spoken of you highly as being far above average in intellect and concern for your fellow men.\nThe impact of each day\u2019s news being as great as it is, it is very easy for us to forget quickly major events of a few days before. Let me, then, refresh your memory on an event that shook the world five short years ago, and which is now all but forgotten, save by a few of us. I refer to what has come to be known, for good biblical reasons, as Armageddon.\nYou will remember, perhaps, the hectic beginnings at the Pine Institute. I confess that I went to work as administrator of the Institute with a sense of shame and foolishness, and for no other reason than money. I had many other offers, but the recruiter from the Institute offered to pay me twice as much as the best of them. I was in debt after three years of poverty as a graduate student, so I took the job, telling myself that I would stay one year, pay off my debts and build my savings, get a respectable job, and deny ever after that I\u2019d been within a hundred miles of Verdigris, Oklahoma.", 0.2353872053872054], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
