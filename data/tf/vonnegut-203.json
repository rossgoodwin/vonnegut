In the dazzling instant, Peter saw that the slopes still seethed with the digging horde. \u201cPerhaps I should give up speaking altogether, Josef.\u201d\n\u201cI ask only that you think out what you say. For your own good, Peter. Please, just stop and think.\u201d\n\u201cEverything you\u2019ve called me down for saying has been the truth. The paper I had to apologize for was the truth.\u201d Peter waited for a rolling barrage of thunder to subside. \u201cI mustn\u2019t speak the truth?\u201d\nJosef peered apprehensively around the corner, squinted into the darkness beneath the eaves. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t speak certain kinds of truth,\u201d he whispered, \u201cnot if you want to go on living.\u201d He dug his hands deep in his pockets, hunched his shoulders. \u201cGive in a little, Peter. Learn to overlook certain things. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d\nTogether, without exchanging another word, the brothers returned to the glare and suffocation of the barracks, their feet making sucking noises in their drenched shoes and socks.\n\u201cToo bad all our things are locked up until morning, Peter,\u201d said Josef loudly.\nPeter hung his coat on a nail to dry, dropped heavily on his hard bunk, and pulled his shoes off. His movements were clumsy, his nerves dulled by a vast aching sensation of pity, of loss. Just as the lightning had revealed for a split second the gray men and gouged mountainsides\u2014so had this talk suddenly revealed in a merciless flash the naked, frightened soul of his brother. Now Peter saw Josef as a frail figure in a whirlpool, clinging desperately to a raft of compromises. Peter looked down at his unsteady hands. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way,\u201d Josef had said, and Josef was right.\nJosef pulled a thin blanket over his head to screen out the light. Peter tried to lose himself in contemplation of the fossil ant again. Involuntarily, his powerful fingers clamped down on the white chip. The chip and priceless ant snapped in two. Ruefully, Peter examined the faces of the break, hoping to glue them together again. On one of the faces he saw a tiny gray spot, possibly a mineral deposit. Idly, he focused his magnifying glass on it.\n\u201cJosef!\u201d\nSleepily, Josef pushed the blanket away from his face. \u201cYes, Peter?\u201d", 0.01576530612244898], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["pops", 0.05357142857142857], ["leghorn", 0.05357142857142857], ["chicken", 0.05357142857142857], ["jerry", 0.03571428571428571], ["pistol", 0.03571428571428571], ["feed", 0.017857142857142856], ["pound", 0.017857142857142856], ["saving", 0.017857142857142856], ["fired", 0.017857142857142856], ["people", 0.017857142857142856], ["national", 0.017857142857142856], ["africa", 0.017857142857142856], ["gun", 0.017857142857142856], ["society", 0.017857142857142856], ["guard", 0.017857142857142856], ["college", 0.017857142857142856], ["hate", 0.017857142857142856], ["considers", 0.017857142857142856], ["humane", 0.017857142857142856], ["size", 0.017857142857142856], ["sir", 0.017857142857142856], ["draws", 0.017857142857142856], ["bangladesh", 0.017857142857142856], ["interesting", 0.017857142857142856], ["guts", 0.017857142857142856], ["long", 0.017857142857142856], ["birds", 0.017857142857142856], ["going", 0.017857142857142856], ["call", 0.017857142857142856], ["lot", 0.017857142857142856], ["sale", 0.017857142857142856], ["dominate", 0.017857142857142856], ["shortages", 0.017857142857142856], ["india", 0.017857142857142856], ["moscow", 0.017857142857142856], ["met", 0.017857142857142856], ["sally", 0.017857142857142856], ["remember", 0.017857142857142856], ["exits", 0.017857142857142856], ["blows", 0.017857142857142856], ["beg", 0.017857142857142856], ["heck", 0.017857142857142856], ["shots", 0.017857142857142856], ["cake", 0.017857142857142856], ["barrel", 0.017857142857142856], ["gumshoe", 0.017857142857142856], ["protein", 0.017857142857142856], ["left", 0.017857142857142856]], "sentiment": ["LEGHORN: A hundred-and-eighty-pound chicken would feed about two hundred people.
