We traveled and looted our way through Sudetenland and Saxony for eight days, living like kings. The Russians are crazy about Americans. The Russians picked us up in Dresden. We rode from there to the American lines at Halle in Lend-Lease Ford trucks. We\u2019ve since been flown to Le Havre.\nI\u2019m writing from a Red Cross Club in the Le Havre P.O.W. Repatriation Camp.

I know they took several long walking trips, just the two of them. I learned of their good times together from Mother. When I was old enough to be curious about Father\u2019s past, World War Two was about to break out, and Father had developed lockjaw as far as his friendship with Hitler was concerned.\nThink of that: My father could have strangled the worst monster of the century, or simply let him starve or freeze to death. But he became his bosom buddy instead.\nThat is my principal objection to life, I think: It is too easy, when alive, to make perfectly horrible mistakes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe painting Father bought from Hitler was a water-color which is now generally acknowledged as having been the best thing the monster ever did as a painter, and it hung for many years over my parents\u2019 bed in Midland City, Ohio. Its title was: \u201cThe Minorite Church of Vienna.\u201d\n2\nFATHER WAS so well received in Vienna, known to one and all as an American millionaire disguised as a ragged genius, that he roistered there for nearly four years. When the First World War broke out in August of 1914, he imagined that the fancy dress ball was to become a fancy dress picnic, that the party was to be moved out into the countryside. He was so happy, so naive, so self-enchanted, that he asked influential friends if they couldn\u2019t get him a commission in the Hungarian Life Guard, whose officers\u2019 uniforms included a panther skin.\nHe adored that panther skin.\nHe was summoned by the American ambassador to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Henry Clowes, who was a Cleveland man and an acquaintance of Father\u2019s parents. Father was then twenty-two years old. Clowes told Father that he would lose his American citizenship if he joined a foreign army, and that he had made inquiries about Father, and had learned that Father was not the painter he pretended to be, and that Father had been spending money like a drunken sailor, and that he had written to Father\u2019s parents, telling them that their son had lost all touch with reality, and that it was time Father was summoned home and given some honest work to do.\n\u201cWhat if I refuse?\u201d said Father.", 0.08908045977011496], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "god-bless-you-dr-kevorkian": {"tfidf":

Admiral Burke, by then retired of course, died a year before that at the age of ninety-nine. They met on a blind date in 1919, when he was in his first year at the Naval Academy. On that date, she was a last minute substitute for her older sister. Fate.\nThey married four years later. If past performance is any indication, they will surely stay married there at the far end of the blue tunnel throughout all eternity. She said to me, \u201cWhy fool around?\u201d President Clinton told her at her husband\u2019s funeral, when she still had a year to live, \u201cYou have blessed America with your service and set an example not only for navy wives today, and to come, but for all Americans.\u201d\nThe simple epitaph Roberta Gorsuch Burke chose for her tombstone here on Earth: \u201cA Sailor\u2019s Wife.\u201d\ndr. jack kevorkian has again\nunstrapped me from what has become my personal gurney, here, in the lethal injection facility at Huntsville, Texas. Jack has now supervised fifteen controlled near-death experiences for me. Hey, Jack, way to go! On this morning\u2019s trip down the blue tunnel to the pearly gates, Clarence Darrow, the great American defense attorney, dead for sixty years now, came looking for me. He wanted WNYC\u2019s listeners to hear his opinions of television cameras in courtrooms. \u201cI welcome them,\u201d he said, if you can believe it. This man with the reputation of a giant, comes from a rinky-dink little farm town in Ohio.\n\u201cThe presence of those cameras finally acknowledges,\u201d he said to me, \u201cthat justice systems anywhere, anytime, have never cared whether justice was achieved or not. Like Roman games, justice systems are ways for unjust governments\u2014and there is no other sort of government\u2014to be enormously entertaining with real lives at stake.\u201d\nI thanked Mr. Darrow for having made American history much more humane than it would have been otherwise, with his eloquent defenses in court of early organizers of labor unions, of teachers of unpopular scientific truths, and for his vociferous contempt for racism, and for his loathing of the death penalty. And the late, great lawyer Clarence Darrow said only this to me: \u201cI did my best to entertain.\u201d\nSigning off now. Hey, Jack, waddaya say we go downtown for some of that good old Tex-Mex cuisine?\nduring what has been almost\na year of interviewing completely dead people, while only half dead myself, I asked Saint Peter again and again if I could meet a particular hero of mine. He is my fellow Hoosier, the late Eugene Victor Debs of Terre Haute, Indiana. He was five times the Socialist Party\u2019s candidate for president back when this country still had a strong Socialist Party.", 0.1190179573512907], "title": "God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian"},

0.0028089887640449437]], "sentiment": ["The General seemed satisfied that his story was carrying the proper impact. \u201cWhen World War II broke out, this man was immediately made an officer. Everybody expected him to win the war single-handedly. But when the going got tough over there in France, he cracked up completely. It turned out he didn\u2019t know the first thing about leadership, and he couldn\u2019t even take care of himself, so he was sick all the time.\u201d The General lowered his voice. \u201cThe morale in his company was so bad that all his men had thrown away their gas masks rather than carry them on marches. The first thing you know, the Jerries dropped mustard-gas shells all over them. Zip! One whole company wiped out! And I\u2019ll always say it was a library card that killed them. See my point?\u201d\n\u201cYessir, I think so. He was one-sided. Is that it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it in a nutshell,\u201d said the General, beaming. \u201cYou expressed it perfectly. That\u2019s why I brought my whole family out here to the farm to live after the war, to keep us all from getting soft, from getting one-sided. Now spruce up for supper. People with dirty fingernails don\u2019t get to eat around here.\u201d\nII.\nAt 2 a.m. Central Standard Time, as reckoned by the parlor mantel clock in the home of Brigadier General William Cooley, retired, a light beam left the burning sun. At 2:08 it glanced from the lip of a moon crater, and a second later died on earth, in the staring eyes of Haley Brandon.\nHaley lay sleepless between cool sheets, his thin arms folded behind his head, his eyes fixed on the window through which the wistful moonlight streamed. He felt wholly a stranger. None of the old, seemingly sweetly reasonable patterns of the past now applied. He was not actively melancholy\u2014it was too soon for that. Rather, he was like a settler on his first day in a foreign land, bemused by his initial contacts with unfamiliar customs, not yet ready to admit that it would be those customs instead of his own that would enable him to remain and prosper.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see to it that you earn your way as best you can\u2014with good, old-fashioned work. Sounds harsh, maybe, but you\u2019ll thank us for it in later years. We\u2019ll put some meat on you, too,\u201d the General had said at supper. The sweat- and sinew-worship that seemed to pervade life at Ardennes Farm was a great curiosity to Haley. Robust was the password. As a Manhattan cliff-dweller, he had won the loyalty of his small circle of friends\u2014most of them adults and fellow musicians\u2014with the cleverness of his fingers on a piano keyboard, with his promise as a concert pianist. Now, he reflected, the emphasis had been changed to the cleanliness of his fingers, to whether he could move a piano.\nHaley thought about the peculiar man into whose hands he had been delivered for guidance. The General, he knew from having heard his mother talk about him, was a competent manager, a brave soldier, and well off financially, though not given to exhibiting the last-named quality. He had taken over management of the old Cooley farmstead, run by tenants for nearly a generation, after his retirement from the Army. Haley remembered a few discussions between his mother and father as to the truth of his mother\u2019s contention that the General, \u201cdown deep,\u201d had a heart of gold. His mother had never been able to produce much evidence for the affirmative. His father, on the other hand, had always had dozens of incidents to recall, which seemed to back up his opinion that the General was a \u201cpompous, selfish old teddy bear with sawdust for brains.\u201d As he lay abed for his first night in his new home, Haley thought he liked the General. The man was gruff, certainly, but he always gave sound reasons for the things he did.\nHaley flexed his fingers and recalled the dreamlike quality his music had given his life in the past; and a pleasurable shudder passed over him as he reminded himself that that part of his life would begin anew in thirty days\u2014for the General had promised that he might go to Chicago to resume his studies then. That was all that really mattered, Haley decided. Knowing that that much of the future was assured, he decided that he could adjust to any of the new order\u2019s rigors and get along with just about anyone.\nIt was certainly to the General\u2019s credit as a man of compassion that he should understand the importance of music to his new charge, Haley thought, for the man was as tone-deaf as a sparrow, and so were two of his three daughters. Judging from the whistling and humming they did, he had concluded that only Hope was able to carry a tune. Haley had heard that this was a hereditary trait. His mother, or, as Annie had reminded him, his foster mother, had been similarly afflicted. In this thought Haley found some consolation for his not being a blood relative of the Cooleys. There were apparently no instruments on the farm, and the evening\u2019s choice of radio programs had indicated that the General and his family found homicide far more entertaining than music. As Haley had undressed for bed, he had been surprised to hear an excellent, if untrained, tenor voice singing hymns in the barn, and he had wondered who it might have been. It could not have been a Cooley, at any rate. He decided to ask about it in the morning.", 0.13591974755767855], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["general", 0.04950495049504951], ["banghart", 0.04950495049504951], ["haley", 0.039603960396039604], ["singing", 0.0297029702970297], ["annie", 0.0297029702970297], ["night", 0.0297029702970297], ["flemming", 0.019801980198019802], ["board", 0.019801980198019802], ["bulletin", 0.019801980198019802], ["sake", 0.019801980198019802], ["ardennes", 0.009900990099009901], ["longer", 0.009900990099009901], ["set", 0.009900990099009901], ["glare", 0.009900990099009901], ["agreement", 0.009900990099009901], ["irritably", 0.009900990099009901], ["ages", 0.009900990099009901], ["confused", 0.009900990099009901], ["roy", 0.009900990099009901], ["bawled", 0.009900990099009901], ["motorcycle", 0.009900990099009901], ["soothingly", 0.009900990099009901], ["table", 0.009900990099009901], ["breakfast", 0.009900990099009901], ["shrugged", 0.009900990099009901], ["pleasantry", 0.009900990099009901], ["absolute", 0.009900990099009901], ["gratitude", 0.009900990099009901], ["looked", 0.009900990099009901], ["heaven", 0.009900990099009901], ["clock", 0.009900990099009901], ["recalling", 0.009900990099009901], ["hope", 0.009900990099009901], ["hammered", 0.009900990099009901], ["blacksmiths", 0.009900990099009901], ["startled", 0.009900990099009901], ["asked", 0.009900990099009901], ["minute", 0.009900990099009901], ["time", 0.009900990099009901], ["ordered", 0.009900990099009901], ["swelled", 0.009900990099009901], ["filled", 0.009900990099009901], ["nice", 0.009900990099009901], ["week", 0.009900990099009901], ["hymn", 0.009900990099009901], ["handing", 0.009900990099009901], ["good", 0.009900990099009901], ["farm", 0.009900990099009901], ["reproachfully", 0.009900990099009901], ["lungs", 0.009900990099009901], ["started", 0.009900990099009901], ["rock", 0.009900990099009901], ["kitty", 0.009900990099009901], ["regiment", 0.009900990099009901], ["mine", 0.009900990099009901], ["step", 0.009900990099009901], ["backwards", 0.009900990099009901], ["coffee", 0.009900990099009901], ["commanding", 0.009900990099009901], ["seat", 0.009900990099009901], ["nodded", 0.009900990099009901], ["man", 0.009900990099009901], ["resumed", 0.009900990099009901], ["reaction", 0.009900990099009901], ["sister", 0.009900990099009901], ["bellows", 0.009900990099009901], ["room", 0.009900990099009901], ["slept", 0.009900990099009901], ["powerful", 0.009900990099009901], ["stay", 0.009900990099009901], ["morning", 0.009900990099009901], ["will", 0.009900990099009901], ["justice", 0.009900990099009901], ["range", 0.009900990099009901], ["seething", 0.009900990099009901], ["stopped", 0.009900990099009901], ["three", 0.009900990099009901], ["fidgeted", 0.009900990099009901], ["situation", 0.009900990099009901], ["voice", 0.009900990099009901]], "sentiment": ["Haley was startled by the reaction his pleasantry had started. He had never before set a man seething with gratitude, and the situation confused him. \u201cRock of Ages is very nice,\u201d he said at last, recalling that Mr. Banghart had done justice to this hymn the night before.\nMr. Banghart\u2019s lungs swelled like blacksmiths\u2019 bellows, and the room was filled with his powerful singing voice. Haley took a step backwards. The General hammered on the table. \u201cNot during breakfast!\u201d he bawled above the singing, as though he were commanding a regiment.\nMr. Banghart stopped his singing immediately. \u201cNow you\u2019re against me,\u201d he said reproachfully.\n\u201cOh, for Heaven\u2019s sake, I am not against you,\u201d said the General irritably, \u201cbut I certainly will be if you do that again.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Mr. Banghart, \u201cbut more for your sake than for mine.\u201d He shrugged, and resumed his seat by the range.\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d said the General soothingly. He looked up at the clock and fidgeted. \u201cNow Where\u2019s that Kitty?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat time did she get in last night, Annie?\u201d\n\u201cThree in the morning,\u201d said Annie, handing Mr. Banghart his coffee. \u201cShe was out with that Roy Flemming again,\u201d she added.

It wasn\u2019t a famous air raid back then in America. Not many Americans knew how much worse it had been than Hiroshima, for instance. I didn\u2019t know that, either. There hadn\u2019t been much publicity.\nI happened to tell a University of Chicago professor at a cocktail party about the raid as I had seen it, about the book I would write. He was a member of a thing called The Committee on Social Thought. And he told me about the concentration camps, and about how the Germans had made soap and candles out of the fat of dead Jews and so on. All I could say was, \u201cI know, I know.

And I became a public relations man for General Electric in Schenectady, New York, and a volunteer fireman in the village of Alplaus, where I bought my first home. My boss there was one of the toughest guys I ever hope to meet. He had been a lieutenant colonel in public relations in Baltimore. While I was in Schenectady he joined the Dutch Reformed Church, which is a very tough church, indeed.\nHe used to ask me sneeringly sometimes why I hadn\u2019t been an officer, as though I\u2019d done something wrong.\nMy wife and I had lost our baby fat. Those were our scrawny years. We had a lot of scrawny veterans and their scrawny wives for friends. The nicest veterans in Schenectady, I thought, the kindest and funniest ones, the ones who hated war the most, were the ones who\u2019d really fought.\nI wrote the Air Force back then, asking for details about the raid on Dresden, who ordered it, how many planes did it, why they did it, what desirable results there had been and so on. I was answered by a man who, like myself, was in public relations. He said that he was sorry, but that the information was top secret still.\nI read the letter out loud to my wife, and I said, \u201cSecret?

One day, I remember, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.\u201d He said this about graduation addresses: \u201cI think it would be better if colleges spread out the really important stuff over four years, instead of saving it all up for the very end.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get from me: All the really important stuff at the very end.\nI am so smart I know what is wrong with the world. Everybody asks during and after our wars, and the continuing terrorist attacks all over the globe, \u201cWhat\u2019s gone wrong?\u201d\nWhat has gone wrong is that too many people, including high school kids and heads of state, are obeying the Code of Hammurabi, a King of Babylonia who lived nearly four thousand years ago. And you can find his code echoed in the Old Testament, too. Are you ready for this?\n\u201cAn eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u201d\nA categorical imperative for all who live in obedience to the Code of Hammurabi, which includes heroes of every cowboy show and gangster show you ever saw, is this: Every injury, real or imagined, shall be avenged. Somebody\u2019s going to be really sorry.\n(Horrible laugh.)\nBombs away\u2014or whatever.\nWhen Jesus Christ was nailed to a cross, he said, \u201cForgive them, Father, they know not what they do.\u201d What kind of a man was that? Any real man, obeying the Code of Hammurabi, would have said, \u201cKill them, Dad, and all their friends and relatives, and make their deaths slow and painful.\u201d\nHis greatest legacy to us, in my humble opinion, consists of only twelve words.

Each bedroom had a floor-to-ceiling wall of glass looking westward\u2014toward the waterfront for deep-draft vessels dredged in the delta three kilometers away.\nIn the past, that waterfront had teemed with commerce, and ships from all over the planet had delivered meat and grain and vegetables and fruit and vehicles and clothing and machinery and household appliances, and so on, and carried away, in fair exchange, Ecuadorian coffee and cocoa and sugar and petroleum and gold, and Indian arts and crafts, including \u201cPanama\u201d hats, which had always come from Ecuador and not from Panama.\nBut there were only two ships out there now, as James Wait sat in the bar, nursing a rum and Coca-Cola. He was not a drinker, actually, since he lived by his wits, and could not afford to have the delicate switches of the big computer in his skull short-circuited by alcohol. His drink was a theatrical prop\u2014like the price tag on his ridiculous shirt.\nHe was in no position to judge whether the state of affairs at the waterfront was normal or not. Until two days before, he had never even heard of Guayaquil, and this was the first time in his life he had ever been below the equator. As far as he was concerned, the El Dorado was no different from all the other characterless hostelries he had used as hideouts in the past\u2014in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, in San Ignacio, Mexico, in Watervliet, New York, and on and on.", 0.05010517260517261], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["woman", 0.0375], ["husband", 0.0375], ["house", 0.025], ["years", 0.025], ["couldn", 0.025], ["brain", 0.025], ["cherchez", 0.0125], ["live", 0.0125], ["months", 0.0125], ["help", 0.0125], ["absolutely", 0.0125], ["moved", 0.0125], ["hearing", 0.0125], ["ready", 0.0125], ["good", 0.0125], ["dear", 0.0125], ["hell", 0.0125], ["hemorrhage", 0.0125], ["work", 0.0125], ["find", 0.0125], ["biography", 0.0125], ["femme", 0.0125], ["autobiography", 0.0125], ["uninvited", 0.0125], ["abe", 0.0125], ["la", 0.0125], ["authoritative", 0.0125], ["twenty", 0.0125], ["writes", 0.0125], ["selected", 0.0125], ["young", 0.0125], ["long", 0.0125], ["scares", 0.0125], ["write", 0.0125], ["amazing", 0.0125], ["going", 0.0125], ["died", 0.0125], ["berman", 0.0125], ["place", 0.0125], ["three", 0.0125], ["war", 0.0125], ["friend", 0.0125], ["pants", 0.0125], ["life", 0.0125], ["energetic", 0.0125], ["voluptuous", 0.0125], ["big", 0.0125], ["knew", 0.0125], ["bear", 0.0125], ["nation", 0.0125], ["colonels", 0.0125], ["men", 0.0125], ["nice", 0.0125], ["surgeon", 0.0125], ["day", 0.0125], ["change", 0.0125], ["ago", 0.0125], ["forty", 0.0125], ["generals", 0.0125], ["remember", 0.0125], ["career", 0.0125], ["leave", 0.0125], ["inspired", 0.0125], ["army", 0.0125], ["thought", 0.0125], ["opinionated", 0.0125], ["empty", 0.0125], ["marriage", 0.0125], ["baltimore", 0.0125], ["edith", 0.0125], ["circe", 0.0125], ["widow", 0.0125]], "sentiment": ["What has inspired this amazing career change by one so old?

There are reallife situations so hopeless that no relief is imaginable.\nWhile we were being bombed in Dresden, sitting in a cellar with our arms over our heads in case the ceiling fell, one soldier said as though he were a duchess in a mansion on a cold and rainy night, \u201cI wonder what the poor people are doing tonight.\u201d Nobody laughed, but we were still all glad he said it.

We appear to be standing more or less in a row. It was the Great Depression which made us similarly edgy and watchful. It was World War II which lined us up so nicely, whether we were men or women, whether we were ever in uniform or not. It was an era of romantic anarchy in publishing which gave us money and mentors, willy-nilly, when we were young\u2014while we learned our craft. Words printed on pages were still the principal form of long-distance communication and stored information in America when we were young.\nNo more.\nNor are there many publishers and editors and agents left who are eager to find some way to get money and other forms of encouragement to young writers who write as clumsily as members of my literary generation did when we started out. The wild and wonderful and expensive guess was made back then that, we might acquire some wisdom and learn how to write halfway decently by and by. Writers were needed that much back then.\nIt was an amusing and instructive time for writers\u2014for hundreds of them.", 0.15865384615384615], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["jenny", 0.06321839080459771], ["george", 0.034482758620689655], ["kid", 0.028735632183908046], ["knew", 0.017241379310344827], ["sultan", 0.017241379310344827], ["wasn", 0.017241379310344827], ["spirit", 0.017241379310344827], ["years", 0.011494252873563218], ["controls", 0.011494252873563218], ["going", 0.011494252873563218], ["treating", 0.011494252873563218], ["truth", 0.011494252873563218], ["crowd", 0.011494252873563218], ["body", 0.011494252873563218], ["men", 0.011494252873563218], ["care", 0.011494252873563218], ["love", 0.011494252873563218], ["three", 0.011494252873563218], ["man", 0.011494252873563218], ["woman", 0.011494252873563218], ["inside", 0.011494252873563218], ["heartline", 0.011494252873563218], ["thing", 0.011494252873563218], ["midget", 0.011494252873563218], ["bottle", 0.011494252873563218], ["time", 0.011494252873563218], ["laboratory", 0.005747126436781609], ["half", 0.005747126436781609], ["bright", 0.005747126436781609], ["scientist", 0.005747126436781609], ["radio", 0.005747126436781609], ["human", 0.005747126436781609], ["gh", 0.005747126436781609], ["alla", 0.005747126436781609], ["treasury", 0.005747126436781609], ["lionel", 0.005747126436781609], ["real", 0.005747126436781609], ["good", 0.005747126436781609], ["shell", 0.005747126436781609], ["big", 0.005747126436781609], ["baghdad", 0.005747126436781609], ["ambition", 0.005747126436781609], ["feet", 0.005747126436781609], ["audience", 0.005747126436781609], ["works", 0.005747126436781609], ["shaking", 0.005747126436781609], ["ears", 0.005747126436781609], ["someday", 0.005747126436781609], ["nuttiest", 0.005747126436781609], ["challenged", 0.005747126436781609], ["dead", 0.005747126436781609], ["slave", 0.005747126436781609], ["girl", 0.005747126436781609], ["opened", 0.005747126436781609], ["purple", 0.005747126436781609], ["willpower", 0.005747126436781609], ["capital", 0.005747126436781609], ["burned", 0.005747126436781609], ["bought", 0.005747126436781609], ["business", 0.005747126436781609], ["seconds", 0.005747126436781609], ["1933", 0.005747126436781609], ["fabled", 0.005747126436781609], ["change", 0.005747126436781609], ["bakar", 0.005747126436781609], ["joke", 0.005747126436781609], ["trial", 0.005747126436781609], ["kingdom", 0.005747126436781609], ["asked", 0.005747126436781609], ["brought", 0.005747126436781609], ["bust", 0.005747126436781609], ["appliances", 0.005747126436781609], ["constant", 0.005747126436781609], ["heads", 0.005747126436781609], ["working", 0.005747126436781609], ["twenty", 0.005747126436781609], ["oooooo", 0.005747126436781609], ["secret", 0.005747126436781609], ["bloodshed", 0.005747126436781609], ["affectionate", 0.005747126436781609], ["lived", 0.005747126436781609], ["explanation", 0.005747126436781609], ["exactly", 0.005747126436781609], ["sore", 0.005747126436781609], ["broke", 0.005747126436781609], ["baby", 0.005747126436781609], ["glad", 0.005747126436781609], ["women", 0.005747126436781609], ["locked", 0.005747126436781609], ["work", 0.005747126436781609], ["rickets", 0.005747126436781609], ["rigged", 0.005747126436781609], ["voice", 0.005747126436781609], ["beautiful", 0.005747126436781609], ["heart", 0.005747126436781609], ["crazy", 0.005747126436781609], ["proved", 0.005747126436781609], ["household", 0.005747126436781609], ["turned", 0.005747126436781609], ["general", 0.005747126436781609], ["honey", 0.005747126436781609], ["guessed", 0.005747126436781609], ["curious", 0.005747126436781609], ["trip", 0.005747126436781609], ["court", 0.005747126436781609], ["provide", 0.005747126436781609], ["grand", 0.005747126436781609], ["answer", 0.005747126436781609], ["boob", 0.005747126436781609], ["company", 0.005747126436781609], ["poor", 0.005747126436781609], ["pain", 0.005747126436781609], ["thrilled", 0.005747126436781609], ["wisest", 0.005747126436781609], ["wrong", 0.005747126436781609], ["fell", 0.005747126436781609], ["mad", 0.005747126436781609], ["president", 0.005747126436781609], ["magician", 0.005747126436781609], ["grow", 0.005747126436781609], ["refrigerator", 0.005747126436781609], ["ago", 0.005747126436781609], ["scurvy", 0.005747126436781609], ["eats", 0.005747126436781609], ["face", 0.005747126436781609], ["person", 0.005747126436781609], ["honestly", 0.005747126436781609], ["pleasure", 0.005747126436781609]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI\u2019m certainly glad to see you taking care of yourself for a change,\u201d Jenny said.

Here George had proved there wasn\u2019t anything inside Jenny, and here the crowd was, twenty seconds later, treating her like a real human being again. The women were shaking their heads to let Jenny know they knew what a trial it was to get a man to take care of himself. And the men were giving George secret looks to let him know they knew what a good pain it was to have a woman always treating you like a baby.\nThe only person who wasn\u2019t going along with the act, who wasn\u2019t being a boob for the pleasure of it, was the kid who\u2019d guessed there was a midget inside. He was sore about being wrong, and his big ambition was to bust up the act with truth\u2014Truth with a capital T. He\u2019ll grow up to be a scientist someday. \u201cAll right,\u201d the kid said, \u201cif there isn\u2019t a midget in there, then I know exactly how it works.\u201d\n\u201cHow, honey?\u201d said Jenny. She was all ears for whatever bright little thing this kid was going to say. She really burned him up.\n\u201cRadio controls!\u201d the kid said.\n\u201cOooooo!\u201d said Jenny. She was thrilled. \u201cThat would be a grand way to do it!\u201d\nThe kid turned purple. \u201cYou can joke around all you want,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s the answer and you know it.\u201d He challenged George. \u201cWhat\u2019s your explanation?\u201d he said.\n\u201cThree thousand years ago,\u201d said George, \u201cthe sultan of Alla-Bakar fell in love with the wisest, most affectionate, most beautiful woman who ever lived. She was Jenny, a slave girl.\n\u201cThe old sultan knew there would be constant bloodshed in his kingdom,\u201d said George, \u201cbecause men who saw Jenny always went mad for her love. So the old sultan had his court magician take Jenny\u2019s spirit out of her body and put it in a bottle. This he locked up in his treasury.\n\u201cIn 1933,\u201d said George, \u201cLionel O. Heartline, president of the General Household Appliances Company, bought a curious bottle while on a business trip to fabled Baghdad. He brought it home, opened it, and out came the spirit of Jenny\u2014three thousand years old. I was working in the Research Laboratory of GH at the time, and Mr. Heartline asked me what I could provide in the way of a new body for Jenny. So I rigged the shell of a refrigerator with a face, a voice, and feet\u2014and with spirit controls, which work on Jenny\u2019s willpower alone.\u201d", 0.13459990530303031], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["died", 0.045454545454545456], ["good", 0.045454545454545456], ["alcoholic", 0.030303030303030304], ["relatives", 0.030303030303030304], ["indianapolis", 0.030303030303030304], ["alex", 0.030303030303030304], ["insane", 0.015151515151515152], ["gates", 0.015151515151515152], ["temporarily", 0.015151515151515152], ["cancer", 0.015151515151515152], ["preserving", 0.015151515151515152], ["rest", 0.015151515151515152], ["son", 0.015151515151515152], ["rate", 0.015151515151515152], ["paper", 0.015151515151515152], ["shepherded", 0.015151515151515152], ["fashioned", 0.015151515151515152], ["uncle", 0.015151515151515152], ["peter", 0.015151515151515152], ["brothers", 0.015151515151515152], ["standing", 0.015151515151515152], ["wandered", 0.015151515151515152], ["guess", 0.015151515151515152], ["denial", 0.015151515151515152], ["alcohol", 0.015151515151515152], ["aunts", 0.015151515151515152], ["drunkards", 0.015151515151515152], ["secret", 0.015151515151515152], ["paternal", 0.015151515151515152], ["grandmother", 0.015151515151515152], ["parts", 0.015151515151515152], ["saint", 0.015151515151515152], ["jobs", 0.015151515151515152], ["vonnegut", 0.015151515151515152], ["uncles", 0.015151515151515152], ["time", 0.015151515151515152], ["machine", 0.015151515151515152], ["intent", 0.015151515151515152], ["marriages", 0.015151515151515152], ["poisoning", 0.015151515151515152], ["sisters", 0.015151515151515152], ["interchangeable", 0.015151515151515152], ["trouble", 0.015151515151515152], ["pearly", 0.015151515151515152], ["nieces", 0.015151515151515152], ["nephews", 0.015151515151515152], ["atheist", 0.015151515151515152], ["loneliness", 0.015151515151515152], ["harder", 0.015151515151515152], ["taint", 0.015151515151515152], ["will", 0.015151515151515152], ["genteel", 0.015151515151515152], ["simply", 0.015151515151515152], ["dread", 0.015151515151515152], ["mother", 0.015151515151515152], ["making", 0.015151515151515152], ["introduced", 0.015151515151515152], ["american", 0.015151515151515152]], "sentiment": ["Yes, and the paper\u2019s genteel denial of his ever having had trouble with alcohol had the old-fashioned intent of preserving from taint all the rest of us who had the same last name.\nWe would all have a harder time making good Indianapolis marriages or getting good Indianapolis jobs, if it were known for certain that we had had relatives who were once drunkards, or who, like my mother and my son, had gone at least temporarily insane.\nIt was even a secret that my paternal grandmother died of cancer.\nThink of that.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAt any rate, if Uncle Alex, the atheist, found himself standing before Saint Peter and the Pearly Gates after he died, I am certain he introduced himself as follows:\n\u201cMy name is Alex Vonnegut.

We few, we happy few, we band of brothers\u2014joined in the serious business of keeping our food, shelter, clothing and loved ones from combining with oxygen. I tell you, boys, I used to belong to a volunteer fire department, and I'd belong to one now, if there were such a human thing, such a humane thing, in New York City.\" This was bunk about Eliot's having been a fireman. The closest he had ever come to that was during his annual childhood visits to Rosewater County, to the family fief. Sycophants among the townies had flattered little Eliot by making him mascot of the Volunteer Fire Department of Rosewater. He had never fought a fire.\n\"I tell you, boys,\" he went on, \"if those Russian landing barges come barging in some day, and there isn't any way to stop 'em, all the phony bastards who get all the good jobs in this country by kissing ass will be down to meet the conquerers with vodka and caviar, offering to do any kind of work the Russians have in mind. And you know who'll take to the woods with hunting knives and Springfields, who'll go on fighting for a hundred years, by God? The volunteer firemen, that's who.\"\nEliot was locked up in Swarthmore on a drunk and disorderly charge. When he awoke the next morning, the police called his wife. He apologized to her, slunk home.\nBut he was off again in a month, carousing with firemen in Clover Lick, West Virginia, one night, and in New Egypt, New Jersey, the next. And on that trip he traded clothes with another man, swapped a four-hundred-dollar suit for a 1939 double-breasted blue chalkstripe, with shoulders like Gibraltar, lapels like the wings of the Archangel Gabriel, and with the creases in the trousers permanently sewed in.\n\"You must be crazy,\" said the New Egypt fireman.\n\"I don't want to look like me,\" Eliot replied. \"I want to look like you. You're the salt of the earth, by God. You're what's good about America, men in suits like that. You're the soul of the U.S. Infantry.\"\nAnd Eliot eventually traded away everything in his wardrobe but his tails, his dinner jacket, and one gray flannel suit. His sixteen-foot closet became a depressing museum of coveralls, overalls, Robert Hall Easter specials, field jackets, Eisenhower jackets, sweatshirts and so on. Sylvia wanted to burn them, but Eliot told her, \"Burn my tails, my dinner jacket and my gray flannel suit instead.\"\nEliot was a flamboyantly sick man, even then, but there was no one to hustle him off for treatment, and no one was as yet entranced by the profits to be made in proving him insane. Little Norman Mushari was only twelve in those troubled days, was assembling plastic model airplanes, masturbating, and papering his room with pictures of Senator Joe Mc-Carthy and Roy Cohn. Eliot Rosewater was the farthest thing from his mind.\nSylvia, raised among rich and charming eccentrics, was too European to have him put away. And the Senator was in the political fight of his life, rallying the Republican forces of reaction that had been shattered by the election of Dwight David Eisenhower. When told of his son's bizarre way of life, the Senator refused to worry, on the grounds that the boy was well-bred. \"He's got fiber, he's got spine,\" the Senator said. \"He's experimenting. He'll come back to his senses any time he's good and ready. This family never produced and never will produce a chronic drunk or a chronic lunatic.\"\nHaving said that, he went into the Senate Chamber to deliver his fairly famous speech on the Golden Age of Rome, in which he said, in part:", 0.039101903387617654], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["hapgood", 0.05785123966942149], ["judge", 0.03305785123966942], ["moon", 0.024793388429752067], ["powers", 0.024793388429752067], ["court", 0.024793388429752067], ["claycomb", 0.024793388429752067], ["father", 0.01652892561983471], ["labor", 0.01652892561983471], ["kingdom", 0.01652892561983471], ["righteousness", 0.01652892561983471], ["alcohol", 0.01652892561983471], ["heaven", 0.01652892561983471], ["god", 0.01652892561983471], ["receive", 0.01652892561983471], ["sermon", 0.01652892561983471], ["mount", 0.01652892561983471], ["days", 0.01652892561983471], ["high", 0.01652892561983471], ["problems", 0.01652892561983471], ["remember", 0.01652892561983471], ["derring", 0.008264462809917356], ["telling", 0.008264462809917356], ["earth", 0.008264462809917356], ["fine", 0.008264462809917356], ["find", 0.008264462809917356], ["choose", 0.008264462809917356], ["pretty", 0.008264462809917356], ["peacemakers", 0.008264462809917356], ["lunch", 0.008264462809917356], ["sons", 0.008264462809917356], ["son", 0.008264462809917356], ["easily", 0.008264462809917356], ["school", 0.008264462809917356], ["schools", 0.008264462809917356], ["married", 0.008264462809917356], ["morning", 0.008264462809917356], ["people", 0.008264462809917356], ["unmarried", 0.008264462809917356], ["prediction", 0.008264462809917356], ["pornography", 0.008264462809917356], ["encouraged", 0.008264462809917356], ["christ", 0.008264462809917356], ["fascinated", 0.008264462809917356], ["public", 0.008264462809917356], ["gathered", 0.008264462809917356], ["persecuted", 0.008264462809917356], ["inspired", 0.008264462809917356], ["adventures", 0.008264462809917356], ["called", 0.008264462809917356], ["sake", 0.008264462809917356], ["asked", 0.008264462809917356], ["presumably", 0.008264462809917356], ["family", 0.008264462809917356], ["character", 0.008264462809917356], ["comforted", 0.008264462809917356], ["jesus", 0.008264462809917356], ["taboo", 0.008264462809917356], ["remains", 0.008264462809917356], ["question", 0.008264462809917356], ["live", 0.008264462809917356], ["final", 0.008264462809917356], ["sort", 0.008264462809917356], ["adjourned", 0.008264462809917356], ["exactly", 0.008264462809917356], ["spirit", 0.008264462809917356], ["homes", 0.008264462809917356], ["mercifully", 0.008264462809917356], ["meek", 0.008264462809917356], ["stories", 0.008264462809917356], ["treated", 0.008264462809917356], ["distinguished", 0.008264462809917356], ["history", 0.008264462809917356], ["heart", 0.008264462809917356], ["turned", 0.008264462809917356], ["education", 0.008264462809917356], ["hungered", 0.008264462809917356], ["sir", 0.008264462809917356], ["sufferings", 0.008264462809917356], ["book", 0.008264462809917356], ["merciful", 0.008264462809917356], ["pure", 0.008264462809917356], ["nice", 0.008264462809917356], ["poor", 0.008264462809917356], ["unselfish", 0.008264462809917356], ["man", 0.008264462809917356], ["mourned", 0.008264462809917356], ["inherit", 0.008264462809917356], ["classmate", 0.008264462809917356], ["serious", 0.008264462809917356], ["tales", 0.008264462809917356]], "sentiment": ["It turned out that he had been telling stories all morning in court, too. The judge was fascinated, and almost everybody else in court was, too\u2014presumably by such unselfish high adventures. The judge had encouraged Hapgood, I gathered, to go on and on. Labor history was pornography of a sort in those days, and even more so in these days. In public schools and in the homes of nice people it was and remains pretty much taboo to tell tales of labor\u2019s sufferings and derring-do.\nI remember the name of the judge. It was Claycomb. I am able to remember it so easily because I had been a high-school classmate of the judge\u2019s son, \u201cMoon.\u201d\nMoon Claycomb\u2019s father, according to Powers Hapgood, asked him this final question just before lunch: \u201cMr. Hapgood,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy would a man from such a distinguished family and with such a fine education choose to live as you do?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Hapgood, according to Hapgood. \u201cBecause of the Sermon on the Mount, sir.\u201d\nAnd Moon Claycomb\u2019s father said this: \u201cCourt is adjourned until two P.M.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhat, exactly, was the Sermon on the Mount?\nIt was the prediction by Jesus Christ that the poor in spirit would receive the Kingdom of Heaven; that all who mourned would be comforted; that the meek would inherit the Earth; that those who hungered for righteousness would find it; that the merciful would be treated mercifully; that the pure in heart would see God; that the peacemakers would be called the sons of God; that those who were persecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake would also receive the Kingdom of Heaven; and on and on.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe character in this book inspired by Powers Hapgood is unmarried and has problems with alcohol. Powers Hapgood was married and, so far as I know, had no serious problems with alcohol.", 0.15124163715072805], "title": "Jailbird"}, "petrified-ants": {"tfidf": [["josef", 0.05511811023622047], ["peter", 0.047244094488188976], ["pincers", 0.03937007874015748], ["ants", 0.03937007874015748], ["rock", 0.031496062992125984], ["house", 0.023622047244094488], ["survival", 0.015748031496062992], ["packed", 0.015748031496062992], ["box", 0.015748031496062992], ["camp", 0.015748031496062992], ["selection", 0.007874015748031496], ["years", 0.007874015748031496], ["fear", 0.007874015748031496], ["shrugged", 0.007874015748031496], ["susceptible", 0.007874015748031496], ["starlike", 0.007874015748031496], ["scythes", 0.007874015748031496], ["unpleasant", 0.007874015748031496], ["happened", 0.007874015748031496], ["good", 0.007874015748031496], ["paleontology", 0.007874015748031496], ["fragment", 0.007874015748031496], ["swallows", 0.007874015748031496], ["bigger", 0.007874015748031496], ["blanched", 0.007874015748031496], ["rocks", 0.007874015748031496], ["softly", 0.007874015748031496], ["enclosing", 0.007874015748031496], ["side", 0.007874015748031496], ["hard", 0.007874015748031496], ["gatherings", 0.007874015748031496], ["rate", 0.007874015748031496], ["books", 0.007874015748031496], ["expect", 0.007874015748031496], ["chippings", 0.007874015748031496], ["loathing", 0.007874015748031496], ["subject", 0.007874015748031496], ["pronounced", 0.007874015748031496], ["balefully", 0.007874015748031496], ["numerous", 0.007874015748031496], ["disappeared", 0.007874015748031496], ["losing", 0.007874015748031496], ["steering", 0.007874015748031496], ["wait", 0.007874015748031496], ["chipped", 0.007874015748031496], ["earlobe", 0.007874015748031496], ["studied", 0.007874015748031496], ["doorway", 0.007874015748031496], ["diggers", 0.007874015748031496], ["silence", 0.007874015748031496], ["eyebrows", 0.007874015748031496], ["raised", 0.007874015748031496], ["suddenly", 0.007874015748031496], ["congregate", 0.007874015748031496], ["somethingest", 0.007874015748031496], ["thoughtfully", 0.007874015748031496], ["extinct", 0.007874015748031496], ["composure", 0.007874015748031496], ["matchsticks", 0.007874015748031496], ["wonderful", 0.007874015748031496], ["calm", 0.007874015748031496], ["regained", 0.007874015748031496], ["type", 0.007874015748031496], ["sort", 0.007874015748031496], ["building", 0.007874015748031496], ["head", 0.007874015748031496], ["shell", 0.007874015748031496], ["russian", 0.007874015748031496], ["hurry", 0.007874015748031496], ["word", 0.007874015748031496], ["pincerless", 0.007874015748031496], ["matter", 0.007874015748031496], ["ruggedest", 0.007874015748031496], ["minutes", 0.007874015748031496], ["blurted", 0.007874015748031496], ["huskily", 0.007874015748031496], ["borgorov", 0.007874015748031496], ["ant", 0.007874015748031496], ["guarding", 0.007874015748031496], ["tugged", 0.007874015748031496], ["cross", 0.007874015748031496], ["reeducation", 0.007874015748031496], ["immune", 0.007874015748031496], ["split", 0.007874015748031496], ["unwilling", 0.007874015748031496], ["object", 0.007874015748031496], ["wrong", 0.007874015748031496], ["fell", 0.007874015748031496], ["posters", 0.007874015748031496], ["revealed", 0.007874015748031496], ["ago", 0.007874015748031496], ["natural", 0.007874015748031496], ["third", 0.007874015748031496], ["crowded", 0.007874015748031496], ["disease", 0.007874015748031496], ["fittest", 0.007874015748031496], ["clean", 0.007874015748031496], ["precedent", 0.007874015748031496], ["fact", 0.007874015748031496]], "sentiment": ["Peter found himself looking at the third box with fear and loathing. \u201cYou look, Josef,\u201d he said at last.\nJosef shrugged. \u201cAll right.\u201d He studied the rocks in silence for several minutes. \u201cWell, as you might expect, the pincers are even more pronounced, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd the gatherings are bigger and more crowded, and there are no books, and the posters are as numerous as the ants!\u201d Peter blurted suddenly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d said Josef.\n\u201cAnd the wonderful ants without pincers are gone, aren\u2019t they, Josef?\u201d said Peter huskily.\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d said Josef. \u201cYou\u2019re losing your head over something that happened a thousand thousand years ago\u2014or more.\u201d He tugged thoughtfully at his earlobe. \u201cAs a matter of fact, the pincerless ants do seem extinct.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cAs far as I know, it\u2019s without precedent in paleontology.

There was nothing in sight to divert him, nothing but asphalt, a perspective of blank, numbered fa\u00e7ades, and wisps of cold cirrus clouds in a strip of blue sky. Paul glimpsed the only life visible through a narrow canyon between Buildings 57 and 59, a canyon that opened onto the river and revealed a bank of gray porches in Homestead. On the topmost porch an old man rocked in a patch of sunlight. A child leaned over the railing and launched a square of paper in a lazy, oscillating course to the river\u2019s edge. The youngster looked up from the paper to meet Paul\u2019s gaze. The old man stopped rocking and looked, too, at the curiosity, a living thing in the Ilium Works.\nAs Paul passed Katharine Finch\u2019s desk on his way into his office, she held out his typewritten speech. \u201cThat\u2019s very good, what you said about the Second Industrial Revolution,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOld, old stuff.\u201d\n\u201cIt seemed very fresh to me\u2014I mean that part where you say how the First Industrial Revolution devalued muscle work, then the second one devalued routine mental work. I was fascinated.\u201d\n\u201cNorbert Wiener, a mathematician, said all that way back in the nineteen-forties. It\u2019s fresh to you because you\u2019re too young to know anything but the way things are now.\u201d\n\u201cActually, it is kind of incredible that things were ever any other way, isn\u2019t it? It was so ridiculous to have people stuck in one place all day, just using their senses, then a reflex, using their senses, then a reflex, and not really thinking at all.\u201d\n\u201cExpensive,\u201d said Paul, \u201cand about as reliable as a putty ruler. You can imagine what the scrap heap looked like, and what hell it was to be a service manager in those days. Hangovers, family squabbles, resentments against the boss, debts, the war\u2014every kind of human trouble was likely to show up in a product one way or another.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd happiness, too. I can remember when we had to allow for holidays, especially around Christmas. There wasn\u2019t anything to do but take it. The reject rate would start climbing around the fifth of December, and up and up it\u2019d go until Christmas. Then the holiday, then a horrible reject rate; then New Year\u2019s, then a ghastly reject level. Then things would taper down to normal\u2014which was plenty bad enough\u2014by January fifteenth or so. We used to have to figure in things like that in pricing a product.\u201d\n\u201cDo you suppose there\u2019ll be a Third Industrial Revolution?\u201d", 0.047499298540965205], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["henry", 0.05325443786982249], ["microphone", 0.029585798816568046], ["ellen", 0.029585798816568046], ["confido", 0.023668639053254437], ["market", 0.01775147928994083], ["voice", 0.01775147928994083], ["played", 0.01775147928994083], ["big", 0.011834319526627219], ["hands", 0.011834319526627219], ["em", 0.011834319526627219], ["loudspeaker", 0.011834319526627219], ["movie", 0.011834319526627219], ["hearing", 0.011834319526627219], ["working", 0.011834319526627219], ["ear", 0.011834319526627219], ["aid", 0.011834319526627219], ["billion", 0.011834319526627219], ["amplifier", 0.005917159763313609], ["satisfied", 0.005917159763313609], ["existing", 0.005917159763313609], ["grandly", 0.005917159763313609], ["brain", 0.005917159763313609], ["uneasiness", 0.005917159763313609], ["human", 0.005917159763313609], ["earth", 0.005917159763313609], ["find", 0.005917159763313609], ["clapped", 0.005917159763313609], ["minute", 0.005917159763313609], ["woman", 0.005917159763313609], ["bowers", 0.005917159763313609], ["lucky", 0.005917159763313609], ["famous", 0.005917159763313609], ["background", 0.005917159763313609], ["day", 0.005917159763313609], ["gem", 0.005917159763313609], ["cool", 0.005917159763313609], ["lincoln", 0.005917159763313609], ["magic", 0.005917159763313609], ["lost", 0.005917159763313609], ["whispers", 0.005917159763313609], ["confidos", 0.005917159763313609], ["small", 0.005917159763313609], ["fixed", 0.005917159763313609], ["husband", 0.005917159763313609], ["ears", 0.005917159763313609], ["someday", 0.005917159763313609], ["ten", 0.005917159763313609], ["people", 0.005917159763313609], ["artists", 0.005917159763313609], ["louder", 0.005917159763313609], ["connect", 0.005917159763313609], ["picked", 0.005917159763313609], ["measure", 0.005917159763313609], ["laboratory", 0.005917159763313609], ["best", 0.005917159763313609], ["wonder", 0.005917159763313609], ["living", 0.005917159763313609], ["profit", 0.005917159763313609], ["hooked", 0.005917159763313609], ["mere", 0.005917159763313609], ["waiting", 0.005917159763313609], ["felt", 0.005917159763313609], ["job", 0.005917159763313609], ["invented", 0.005917159763313609], ["boy", 0.005917159763313609], ["accident", 0.005917159763313609], ["ahead", 0.005917159763313609], ["universe", 0.005917159763313609], ["dollars", 0.005917159763313609], ["times", 0.005917159763313609], ["thing", 0.005917159763313609], ["american", 0.005917159763313609], ["blessings", 0.005917159763313609], ["mouth", 0.005917159763313609], ["primitive", 0.005917159763313609], ["divide", 0.005917159763313609], ["simple", 0.005917159763313609], ["einstein", 0.005917159763313609], ["humming", 0.005917159763313609], ["stumble", 0.005917159763313609], ["raise", 0.005917159763313609], ["question", 0.005917159763313609], ["tiny", 0.005917159763313609], ["start", 0.005917159763313609], ["friend", 0.005917159763313609], ["heels", 0.005917159763313609], ["fleeting", 0.005917159763313609], ["huh", 0.005917159763313609], ["hoped", 0.005917159763313609], ["accousti", 0.005917159763313609], ["child", 0.005917159763313609], ["astonished", 0.005917159763313609], ["eat", 0.005917159763313609], ["colleagues", 0.005917159763313609], ["wise", 0.005917159763313609], ["hour", 0.005917159763313609], ["inside", 0.005917159763313609], ["trick", 0.005917159763313609], ["uh", 0.005917159763313609], ["cards", 0.005917159763313609], ["discoveries", 0.005917159763313609], ["claim", 0.005917159763313609], ["ready", 0.005917159763313609], ["full", 0.005917159763313609], ["sales", 0.005917159763313609], ["states", 0.005917159763313609], ["imagination", 0.005917159763313609], ["performed", 0.005917159763313609], ["hearted", 0.005917159763313609], ["watched", 0.005917159763313609], ["backslappers", 0.005917159763313609], ["earpiece", 0.005917159763313609], ["sat", 0.005917159763313609], ["united", 0.005917159763313609], ["russians", 0.005917159763313609], ["noises", 0.005917159763313609], ["snow", 0.005917159763313609], ["actor", 0.005917159763313609], ["laughed", 0.005917159763313609], ["waved", 0.005917159763313609], ["ball", 0.005917159763313609], ["knew", 0.005917159763313609], ["delight", 0.005917159763313609], ["connected", 0.005917159763313609], ["plenty", 0.005917159763313609], ["fair", 0.005917159763313609], ["man", 0.005917159763313609], ["lunch", 0.005917159763313609], ["counter", 0.005917159763313609], ["dollar", 0.005917159763313609], ["trembling", 0.005917159763313609], ["looked", 0.005917159763313609], ["joshed", 0.005917159763313609], ["time", 0.005917159763313609]], "sentiment": ["\u201cEverything about the universe is magic,\u201d said Henry grandly, \u201cand Einstein would be the first to tell you so. All I\u2019ve done is stumble on a trick that\u2019s always been waiting to be performed. It was an accident, like most discoveries, and none other than Henry Bowers is the lucky one.\u201d\nEllen clapped her hands. \u201cOh, Henry, they\u2019ll make a movie of it someday!\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Russians\u2019ll claim they invented it,\u201d laughed Henry. \u201cWell, let \u2019em. I\u2019ll be big about it. I\u2019ll divide up the market with \u2019em. I\u2019ll be satisfied with a mere billion dollars from American sales.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Ellen was lost in the delight of seeing in her imagination a movie about her famous husband, played by an actor that looked very much like Lincoln. She watched the simple-hearted counter of blessings, slightly down at the heels, humming and working on a tiny microphone with which he hoped to measure the minute noises inside the human ear. In the background, colleagues played cards and joshed him for working during the lunch hour. Then he placed the microphone in his ear, connected it to an amplifier and loudspeaker, and was astonished by Confido\u2019s first whispers on earth:\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never get anywhere around here, Henry,\u201d the first, primitive Confido had said. \u201cThe only people who get ahead at Accousti-gem, boy, are the backslappers and snow-job artists. Every day somebody gets a big raise for something you did. Wise up! You\u2019ve got ten times as much on the ball as anybody else in the whole laboratory. It isn\u2019t fair.\u201d\nWhat Henry had done after that was to connect the microphone to a hearing aid instead of a loudspeaker. He fixed the microphone on the earpiece, so that the small voice, whatever it was, was picked up by the microphone, and played back louder by the hearing aid.

I was named at the behest of my maternal grandfather, Benjamin Wills, who was a Socialist and an Atheist, and nothing but a groundskeeper at Butler University, in Indianapolis, Indiana, in honor of Eugene Debs of Terre Haute, Indiana. Debs was a Socialist and a Pacifist and a Labor Organizer who ran several times for the Presidency of the United States of America, and got more votes than has any other candidate nominated by a third party in the history of this country.\nDebs died in 1926, when I was a negative 14 years of age.\nThe year is 2001 now.\nIf all had gone the way a lot of people thought it would, Jesus Christ would have been among us again, and the American flag would have been planted on Venus and Mars.\nNo such luck!\nAT LEAST THE World will end, an event anticipated with great joy by many. It will end very soon, but not in the year 2000, which has come and gone. From that I conclude that God Almighty is not heavily into Numerology.\nGRANDFATHER BENJAMIN WILLS died in 1948, when I was a plus 8 years of age, but not before he made sure that I knew by heart the most famous words uttered by Debs, which are:\n\u201cWhile there is a lower class I am in it.

Indiana.\nDear people:\nI\u2019m told that you were probably never informed that I was anything other than \u201cmissing in action.\u201d Chances are that you also failed to receive any of the letters I wrote from Germany. That leaves me a lot of explaining to do -- in precis:\nI\u2019ve been a prisoner of war since December 19th, 1944, when our division was cut to ribbons by Hitler\u2019s last desperate thrust through Luxemburg and Belgium. Seven Fanatical Panzer Divisions hit us and out us off from the rest of Hodges\u2019 First Army. The other American Divisions on our flanks managed to pull out: We were obliged to stay and fight. Bayonets aren't much good against tanks: Our ammunition, food and medical supplies gave out and our casualties out-numbered those who could still fight - so we gave up. The 106th got a presidential Citation and some British Decoration from Montgomery for it, I\u2019m told, but I\u2019ll be damned if it was worth it. I was one of the few who weren\u2019t wounded. For that much thank God.\nWell, the supermen marched us, without food, water or sleep to Limberg, a distance of about sixty miles, I think, where we were loaded and locked up, sixty men to each small, unventilated, unheated box car. There were no sanitary accommodations -- the floors were covered with fresh cow dung. There wasn\u2019t room for all of us to lie down. Half slept while the other half stood. We spent several days, including Christmas, on that Limberg siding. On Christmas eve the Royal Air Force bombed and strafed our unmarked train. They killed about one-hundred-and-fifty of us. We got a little water Christmas Day and moved slowly across Germany to a large P.O.W. Camp in Muhlburg, South of Berlin. We were released from the box cars on New Year\u2019s Day. The Germans herded us through scalding delousing showers. Many men died from shock in the showers after ten days of starvation, thirst and exposure. But I didn\u2019t.\nUnder the Geneva Convention, Officers and Non-commissioned Officers are not obliged to work when taken prisoner. I am, as you know, a Private. One-hundred-and-fifty such minor beings were shipped to a Dresden work camp on January 10th. I was their leader by virtue of the little German I spoke. It was our misfortune to have sadistic and fanatical guards. We were refused medical attention and clothing: We were given long hours at extremely hard labor. Our food ration was two-hundred-and-fifty grams of black bread and one pint of unseasoned potato soup each day. After desperately trying to improve our situation for two months and having been met with bland smiles I told the guards just what I was going to do to them when the Russians came. They beat me up a little. I was fired as group leader. Beatings were very small time: -- one boy starved to death and the SS Troops shot two for stealing food.\nOn about February 14th the Americans came over, followed by the R.A.F. their combined labors killed 250,000 people in twenty-four hours and destroyed all of Dresden -- possibly the world\u2019s most beautiful city. But not me.\nAfter that we were put to work carrying corpses from Air-Raid shelters; women, children, old men; dead from concussion, fire or suffocation. Civilians cursed us and threw rocks as we carried bodies to huge funeral pyres in the city.\nWhen General Patton took Leipzig we were evacuated on foot to Hellexisdorf on the Saxony-Czechoslovakian border. There we remained until the war ended. Our guards deserted us. On that happy day the Russians were intent on mopping up isolated outlaw resistance in our sector. Their planes (P-39\u2019s) strafed and bombed us, killing fourteen but not me.\nEight of us stole a team and wagon. we traveled and looted our way through Sudetenland and Saxony for eight days, living like kings. The Russians are crazy about Americans. The Russians picked us up in Dresden. We rode from there to the American lines at Halle in Lend-Lease Ford trucks. We\u2019ve since been flown to Le Havre.", -0.033511232775938656], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
