The only reading she had found to be really cool in the past several years centered around vampires, and I was curious to know if high school teachers had resorted to using tales from the crypt. Karina couldn\u2019t remember the name of the story or the name of the author, but she said it was about this time when everyone had to wear weights so everyone could be equal, but there was this one guy who didn\u2019t like it, and he threw off his weights and told everyone else to do the same.\n\u201cWas the guy who didn\u2019t want to wear the weights named Harrison Bergeron?\u201d I asked her.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d she said. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cThe guy who wrote it went to my high school,\u201d I said. \u201cA guy named Vonnegut.\u201d\nJanuary 1, 2000\n[Northampton, MA]\nTO EDIE VONNEGUT\nDearest Edie\u2014\nWhat a good-looking and honorable family we continue to be. I am so heartened by that supremely dignified photograph of Will. I only wish his name was Vonnegut.\nIn the same mail with that picture I received from a stranger a photograph of my father when he was Will\u2019s age\u2014in 1902. Born in Indianapolis, as was his father Bernard, he nonetheless went to a high school for Americans in Strasbourg, France, for I think one year. That is where the picture was taken. I don\u2019t have to tell you Kurt Senior is the one on the picture\u2019s right. These faces live on and on. Father, like you, was a good citizen, a founder, among other virtuous activities, of the Children\u2019s Museum of Indianapolis, one of the best in the world, and designer of a landmark clock at the corner of Washington and Meridian Streets, in the precise center of town, which intersection was and may still be called \u201cThe Crossroads of America.\u201d I was in Indianapolis last June, and I walked under that clock, and I looked up at it, and I said out loud, \u201cHi, Dad.\u201d", 0.13948311688311688], "title": "Letters"}}
