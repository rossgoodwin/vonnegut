Jill is giving a small party here for me tonight, and Andrej Voznesenski has promised to drop by. He has beautiful Italian clothes and gets to fuck just about anybody he likes, I expect.\nSam Lawrence and I went into Leningrad by rail from Helsinki, got searched by border guards at three in the morning. I had all sorts of stuff that might have troubled them, but they didn\u2019t find any of it. It was spooky how they made such a careful search, and yet found nothing. I brought Rita a fancy dictating machine and a huge magnifying glass. I guess she really is in big trouble with her eyes. Her bosses, incidentally, sent contracts along with her, made her their sole negotiator, instructed her to tell us to accept their terms or go to hell, that they weren\u2019t all that interested in publishing me anyhow. Their offer was a generous one by Russian standards, but the shabbiness of making Rita close the deal was dishonorable in the extreme. We all felt as though we were coming down with influenza. One really great Leningrad experience, though: Sam and I saw a new production of Dead Souls at the Pushkin Theater, and it was so brilliantly done that Sam and I almost got nosebleeds from laughing. We needed no interpreter. Amazingly, as I discovered a week later, Sam had never read Dead Souls.\nSam and I were a good deal more troubled by Munich than by Leningrad. We had the shit scared out of us at Oktober Fest, where, about forty years before, Thomas Wolfe was brained with a beer stein. He eventually died as a result. Sam and I didn\u2019t get into any fights, but it was clear to us that the Germans still deserve their reputation of being the most warlike people on Earth. We got the feeling that the West Germans would enjoy having a go at the East Germans some day soon. Young people told us that they were getting out of the country while they still could.\nCheers\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut\nNovember 12, 1977\nNew York City", 0.11753137434955616], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["dear", 0.16], ["woodly", 0.08], ["will", 0.08], ["orifice", 0.04], ["penelope", 0.04], ["harold", 0.04], ["eardrums", 0.04], ["mess", 0.04], ["laughs", 0.04], ["find", 0.04], ["heard", 0.04], ["won", 0.04], ["dearie", 0.04], ["awful", 0.04], ["clean", 0.04], ["crack", 0.04], ["intend", 0.04], ["hallucination", 0.04], ["voice", 0.04], ["bleed", 0.04]], "sentiment": ["What an hallucination!\n(laughs)\nOh, dear, dear, dear, dear.
