But I didn\u2019t let myself lose touch with reality.\u201d\nLasher, Paul realized, was the only one who hadn\u2019t lost touch with reality. He, alone of the four leaders, seemed unshocked by the course of events, undisturbed by them, even, inexplicably, at peace. Paul, perhaps, had been the one most out of touch, having had little time for reflection, having been so eager to join a large, confident organization with seeming answers to the problems that had made him sorry to be alive.\nFinnerty was covering his initial surprise at Lasher\u2019s statement, so perfect an apostle was he. Most of all, apparently, he wanted to remain intellectually as one with the dynamic Lasher, and he, too, now looked at Paul as though surprised to find that Paul wasn\u2019t sure what was going on.\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have a chance, then what on earth was the sense of\u2014?\u201d Paul left the sentence unfinished, and included the ruins of Ilium in a sweep of his hand.\nLasher was fully awake now, and he stood, and paced up and down the room, apparently irritated that he should have to explain something so obvious. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we win or lose, Doctor. The important thing is that we tried. For the record, we tried!\u201d He walked behind Paul\u2019s old desk and faced Paul and Finnerty across it.\n\u201cWhat record?\u201d said Paul.\nSuddenly Lasher underwent a transformation. He showed a side of himself he had mentioned, but which Paul had found impossible to imagine.\nAnd, with the transformation, the desk became a pulpit.\n\u201cRevolutions aren\u2019t my main line of business,\u201d said Lasher, his voice deep and rolling. \u201cI\u2019m a minister, Doctor, remember?
