He was tried and convicted. Thus was he transmogrified from a fish peddler into a known criminal before he and Sacco were tried for murder.\nWas Vanzetti guilty of this lesser crime? Possibly so, but it did not matter much. Who said it did not matter much? The judge who tried the case said it did not matter much. He was Webster Thayer, a graduate of Dartmouth College and a descendent of many fine New England families. He told the jury, \u201cThis man, although he may not have actually committed the crime attributed to him, is nevertheless morally culpable, because he is the enemy of our existing institutions.\u201d\nWord of honor: This was said by a judge in an American court of law. I take the quotation from a book at hand: Labor\u2019s Untold Story, by Richard O. Boyer and Herbert M. Morais. (United Front: San Francisco, 1955.)\nAnd then this same Judge Thayer got to try Sacco and the known criminal Vanzetti for murder. They were found guilty about one year after their arrest\u2014in July of Nineteen-hundred and Twenty-one, when I was eight years old.\nThey were finally electrocuted when I was fifteen. If I heard anybody in Cleveland say anything about it, I have forgotten now.\nI talked to a messenger boy in an elevator in the RAMJAC Building the other morning. He was about my age. I asked him if he remembered anything about the execution when he was a boy. He said that, yes, he had heard his father say he was sick and tired of people talking about Sacco and Vanzetti all the time, and that he was glad it was finally over with.\nI asked him what line of work his father had been in.\n\u201cHe was a bank president in Montpelier, Vermont,\u201d he said.

Of these 276 were hits. These hits not only vaporized the bridgehead\u2014they rendered the moon unfit for human occupation for at least ten million years.\nAnd, in a freak of war, one wild shot missed the moon and hit an incoming formation of space ships that carried 15,671 Martian Imperial Commandos. That took care of all the Martian Imperial Commandos there were.\nThey wore knee spikes, and glossy black uniforms, and carried 14-inch, saw-toothed knives in their boots. Their insignia was a skull and crossbones.\nTheir motto was Per aspera ad astra, the same as the motto of Kansas, U.S.A., Earth, Solar System, Milky Way.\nThere was then a lull of thirty-two days, the length of time it took for the main Martian striking force to cross the void between the two planets. This hammer blow consisted of 81,932 troops in 2,311 ships. Every military unit, save for the Martian Imperial Commandos, was represented. Earth was spared suspense as to when this terrible armada might arrive. The Martian broadcasters on the moon, before being vaporized, had promised the arrival of this irresistible force in thirty-two days.\nIn thirty-two days, four hours, and fifteen minutes, the Martian Armada flew into a radar-directed thermo-nuclear barrage. The official estimate of the number of thermo-nuclear anti-aircraft rockets fired at the Martian armada is 2,542,670. The actual number of rockets fired is of little interest when one can express the power of that barrage in another way, in a way that happens to be both poetry and truth. The barrage turned the skies of Earth from heavenly blue to a hellish burnt orange. The skies remained burnt orange for a year and a half.\nOf the mighty Martian Armada, only 761 ships carrying 26,635 troops survived the barrage and landed on Earth.", -0.006388888888888883], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["mona", 0.03278688524590164], ["frank", 0.02459016393442623], ["papa", 0.02459016393442623], ["peace", 0.01639344262295082], ["small", 0.01639344262295082], ["bokonon", 0.01639344262295082], ["uniform", 0.01639344262295082], ["long", 0.01639344262295082], ["white", 0.01639344262295082], ["eyes", 0.01639344262295082], ["understand", 0.01639344262295082], ["wore", 0.01639344262295082], ["plenty", 0.01639344262295082], ["man", 0.01639344262295082], ["customary", 0.00819672131147541], ["gold", 0.00819672131147541], ["pointed", 0.00819672131147541], ["yellow", 0.00819672131147541], ["shape", 0.00819672131147541], ["karass", 0.00819672131147541], ["mentioned", 0.00819672131147541], ["blocked", 0.00819672131147541], ["deathly", 0.00819672131147541], ["personal", 0.00819672131147541], ["bounceless", 0.00819672131147541], ["hoenikker", 0.00819672131147541], ["brown", 0.00819672131147541], ["woman", 0.00819672131147541], ["hilarious", 0.00819672131147541], ["hoptoad", 0.00819672131147541], ["fat", 0.00819672131147541], ["breast", 0.00819672131147541], ["hands", 0.00819672131147541], ["snare", 0.00819672131147541], ["shoulder", 0.00819672131147541], ["melting", 0.00819672131147541], ["joined", 0.00819672131147541], ["steps", 0.00819672131147541], ["view", 0.00819672131147541], ["insane", 0.00819672131147541], ["crowd", 0.00819672131147541], ["observed", 0.00819672131147541], ["books", 0.00819672131147541], ["girl", 0.00819672131147541], ["pale", 0.00819672131147541], ["blouse", 0.00819672131147541], ["god", 0.00819672131147541], ["finger", 0.00819672131147541], ["lard", 0.00819672131147541], ["stopped", 0.00819672131147541], ["loose", 0.00819672131147541], ["greedy", 0.00819672131147541], ["difficulty", 0.00819672131147541], ["members", 0.00819672131147541], ["drumming", 0.00819672131147541], ["drum", 0.00819672131147541], ["thing", 0.00819672131147541], ["franklin", 0.00819672131147541], ["heartbroken", 0.00819672131147541], ["narrow", 0.00819672131147541], ["major", 0.00819672131147541], ["rapturously", 0.00819672131147541], ["love", 0.00819672131147541], ["simple", 0.00819672131147541], ["feet", 0.00819672131147541], ["holster", 0.00819672131147541], ["chromium", 0.00819672131147541], ["fast", 0.00819672131147541], ["creamy", 0.00819672131147541], ["shouldered", 0.00819672131147541], ["flat", 0.00819672131147541], ["warm", 0.00819672131147541], ["child", 0.00819672131147541], ["true", 0.00819672131147541], ["wristed", 0.00819672131147541], ["bodyguard", 0.00819672131147541], ["balls", 0.00819672131147541], ["soul", 0.00819672131147541], ["thin", 0.00819672131147541], ["played", 0.00819672131147541], ["general", 0.00819672131147541], ["eighteen", 0.00819672131147541], ["reviewing", 0.00819672131147541], ["dress", 0.00819672131147541], ["45", 0.00819672131147541], ["plated", 0.00819672131147541], ["drummer", 0.00819672131147541], ["stand", 0.00819672131147541], ["poor", 0.00819672131147541], ["simplicity", 0.00819672131147541], ["serene", 0.00819672131147541], ["thrilled", 0.00819672131147541], ["hair", 0.00819672131147541], ["sandals", 0.00819672131147541], ["medal", 0.00819672131147541], ["forever", 0.00819672131147541], ["weapon", 0.00819672131147541], ["lank", 0.00819672131147541], ["unreasonable", 0.00819672131147541], ["looked", 0.00819672131147541], ["greek", 0.00819672131147541], ["bedtime", 0.00819672131147541], ["dream", 0.00819672131147541], ["trembled", 0.00819672131147541]], "sentiment": ["PEACE AND PLENTY\nAND THEN THE CROWD was deathly still again.\n\u201cPapa\u201d and Mona and Frank joined us on the reviewing stand.

(as, Do like I do), though occasionally found in good writers, is a provincialism and contrary to good usage.\" \"M-W-2\" says that the same thing \"is freely used only in illiterate speech and is now regarded as incorrect.\" \"M-W-3\" issues no warnings whatsoever, and flaunts models of current, O.K. usage from the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Independent, \"wore his clothes like he was ... afraid of getting dirt on them,\" and Art Linkletter, \"impromptu programs where they ask questions much like I do on the air.\" \"M-W-3,\" incidentally, came out during the dying days of the Eisenhower Administration, when simply everybody was talking like Art Linkletter.\nRandom House, in the catbird seat, since it gets to recite last, declares in 1966, \"The use of like in place of as is universally condemned by teachers and editors, notwithstanding its wide currency, especially in advertising slogans. Do as I say, not as I do does not admit of like instead of as. In an occasional idiomatic phrase, it is somewhat less offensive when substituted for as if (He raced down the street like crazy), but this example is clearly colloquial and not likely to be found in any but the most informal written contexts.\" I find this excellent. It even tells who will hurt you if you make a mistake, and it withholds aid and comfort from those friends of cancer and money, those greedy enemies of the language who teach our children to say after school, \"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.\"\nRandom House is damned if it will set that slogan in type.\nAs you rumple through this new dictionary, looking for dirty words and schoolmarmisms tempered by worldliness, you will discover that biographies and major place names and even the names of famous works of art are integrated with the vocabulary: A Streetcar Named Desire, Ralph Ellison, Mona Lisa, Kiselevsk. I worry about the biographies and the works of art, since they seem a mixed bag, possibly locked for all eternity in a matrix of type. Norman Mailer is there, for instance, but not William Styron or James Jones or Vance Bourjaily or Edward Lewis Wallant. And are we to be told throughout eternity this and no more about Alger Hiss: \"born 1904, U.S. public official\"? And why is there no entry for Whittaker Chambers? And who promoted Peress?\nIt is the biographical inclusions and exclusions, in fact, which make this dictionary an ideal gift for the paranoiac on everybody\u2019s Christmas list. He will find dark entertainments without end between pages i and 2,059. Why are we informed about Joe Kennedy, Sr., and Jack and Bobby, but not about Teddy or Jacqueline? What is somebody trying to tell us when T. S. Eliot is called a British poet and W. H. Auden is called an English poet? (Maybe the distinction aims at accounting for Auden\u2019s American citizenship.) And when Robert Welch Jr., is tagged as a \"retired U.S. candy manufacturer,\" is this meant to make him look silly? And why is the memory of John Dillinger perpetuated, while of Adolf Eichmann there is neither gibber nor squeak?\nWhoever decides to crash the unabridged dictionary game next\u2014and it will probably be General Motors or Ford\u2014 they will winnow this work heartlessly for bloopers. There can\u2019t be many, since Random House has winnowed its noble predecessors. The big blooper, it seems to me, is not putting the biographies and works of art in an appendix, where they can be cheaply revised or junked or added to.\nHave I made it clear that this book is a beauty? You can\u2019t beat the contents, and you can\u2019t beat the price. Somebody will beat both sooner or later, of course, because that is good old Free Enterprise, where the consumer benefits from battles between jolly green giants.\nAnd, as I\u2019ve said, one dictionary is as good as another for most people. Homo Americanus is going to go on speaking and writing the way he always has, no matter what dictionary he owns. Consider the citizen who was asked recently what he thought of President Johnson\u2019s use of the slang expression \"cool it\" in a major speech:\n\"It\u2019s fine with me,\" he replied. \"Now\u2019s not the time for the President of the United States to worry about the King\u2019s English. After all, we\u2019re living in an informal age. Politicians don\u2019t go around in top hats any more. There\u2019s no reason why the English language shouldn\u2019t wear sports clothes, too.

Selma Ritter had fainted dead away.\nHALL OF MIRRORS\nThere was a parking lot, and then a guitar school, and then Fred\u2019s O.K. Used Car Lot, and then the hypnotist\u2019s house, and then a vacant lot with the foundation of a mansion still on it, and then the Beeler Brothers\u2019 Funeral Home. Autumn winds, experimenting with the idea of a hard winter, made little twists of soot and paper, made the plastic propellers over the used car lot go frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.\nThe city was Indianapolis, the largest city not on a navigable waterway in the world.\nIt was to the hypnotist\u2019s house that the two city detectives came. They were Detectives Carney and Foltz, Carney young and dapper, Foltz middle-aged and rumpled. Carney went up the hypnotist\u2019s steps like a tap dancer. Foltz, though he was going to do all the talking, trudged far behind. Carney\u2019s interest was specific. He was going straight for the hypnotist. Foltz\u2019s attention was diffused. He marveled at the monstrous architecture of the hypnotist\u2019s twenty-room house, let his mournful eyes climb the tower at one corner of the house. There had to be a ballroom at the top of the tower. There were ballrooms at the tops of all the towers that the rich had abandoned.\nFoltz reached the hypnotist\u2019s door at last, rang the bell. The only hint of quackery was a small sign over the doorbell. K. HOLLOMON WEEMS, it said, HYPNOTIC THERAPY.\nWeems himself came to the door. He was in his fifties, small, narrow-shouldered, neat. His nose was long, his lips full and red, and his bald head had a seeming phosphorescence.

I think it is just the other way around. Those countries have a religion called Communism, and the Free World is where sustaining religions are in very short supply.\n\u201cI am about to make my own ancestral guess as to what Ufe is all about, and what young people should do with it. I will again issue the caveat that I am as full of baloney as anybody, and that anybody who says for sure what life is all about might as well lecture on Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, and tooth fairies, as well.\n\u201cI am, incidentally, the world\u2019s greatest authority on tooth fairies. That is how most of my life has been spent: in the study of tooth fairies. That should be carved on my tombstone. I was the one who discovered that tooth fairies are cannibals. Mostly, Tooth Fairies eat june bugs, of course. But under crowded conditions and in an atmosphere rich in carbon monoxide, tooth fairies eat each other, too.\n\u201cAnd who can blame them?\n\u201cOkay.\n\u201cWhat should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured. Young people should also identify and expound theories about life in which sane human beings almost everywhere can believe.\n\u201cI suggest that we need a new religion. If suggesting that we need a new religion is sacrilege, then the emperor Constantine was guilty of sacrilege, and the emperor Nero was an admirably pious man. And I want to point out that it is impossible to discard an old religion entirely. The religion of Nero survives today, determining as it does the dates and even moods of so many of our so-called Christian holidays.\n\u201cEaster is a time for the renewal of life, and it always has been, apparently, even when people ate mastodon meat. Nothing is more human than to wish for renewal when springtime comes. And, out of respect for our ancestors, it is in the area of spiritual renewal that we are the most conservative. We must become less conservative.\n\u201cWhat makes me think we need a new religion? That\u2019s easy. An effective religion allows people to imagine from moment to moment what is going on and how they should behave. Christianity used to be like that. Our country is now jammed with human beings who say out loud that life is chaos to them, and that it doesn\u2019t seem to matter what anybody does next. This is worse than being seasick.\n\u201cMight not we do without religion entirely? Plenty of people have tried\u2014not in Communist countries, as I\u2019ve already said, but here. A lot of people have been forced to do without it\u2014because the old-time religions they know of are too superstitious, too full of magic, too ignorant about biology and physics to harmonize with

since he had notarized the affidavits in my portfolio. But he never mentioned them to me, or so far as I know to anyone. He was the soul of discretion.\nLyle was probably the best-liked man in this valley. Townies were so fond of him, men and women alike, that I never heard one call the Black Cat Caf\u00e9 a whorehouse. Up on the hill, of course, it was called almost nothing else.\nThe Townies protected the image he had of himself, in spite of State Police raids and visits from the County Health Department, as a family man who ran a place of refreshment whose success depended entirely on the quality of the drinks and snacks he served. This kindly conspiracy protected Lyle\u2019s son Charlton, as well. Charlton grew to be 2 meters tall, and was a New York State High School All-Star basketball center in his senior year at Scipio High School, and all he ever had to say about his father was that he ran a restaurant.\nCharlton was such a phenomenal basketball player that he was invited to try out for the New York Knickerbockers, which were still owned by Americans back then. He accepted a full scholarship to MIT instead, and became a top scientist running the huge subatomic particle accelerator called \u201cthe Supercollider\u201d outside Waxahachie, Texas.\nAS I UNDERSTAND it, the scientists down there forced invisible particles to reveal their secrets by making them go splat on photographic plates. That isn\u2019t all that different from the way we treated suspected enemy agents in Vietnam sometimes.\nHave I already said that I threw one out of a helicopter?\nTHE TOWNIES DIDN\u2019T have to protect the sensibilities of Lyle\u2019s wife by never saying why the Black Cat Caf\u00e9 was so prosperous. She had left him. She discovered in midlife that she was a lesbian, and ran off with the high school\u2019s girls\u2019 gym teacher to Bermuda, where they gave and probably still give sailing lessons.\nI made a pass at her one time at an Annual Town-and-Gown Mixer up on the hill. I knew she was a lesbian before she did.\nAT THE VERY end of his life 2 years ago, though, when Lyle Hooper was a prisoner of the escaped convicts up in the bell tower, he was addressed by his captors as \u201cPimp.\u201d It was, \u201cHey, Pimp, how you like the view?\u201d and \u201cWhat you think we ought to do with you, Pimp?\u201d and so on. It was cold and wet up there. Snow or rain blown into the belfry fell down through a myriad of bullet holes in the ceiling. Those had been made from below by escaped convicts when they realized that a sniper was up there among the bells.", 0.10200975269940789], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["mother",

It was in a dazzlingly sunny patients\u2019 lounge. The unexpected beauty was in the form of Celia Hoover, n\u00e9e Hildreth, again. She had fallen asleep on a couch, and her eleven-year-old son was watching over her. She had evidently brought him with her to the hospital, rather than leave him alone at home in the blizzard.\nHe was seated stiffly on the edge of the couch. Even in sleep, she was keeping him captive. She was holding his hand. I had the feeling that, if he had tried to get up, she would have awakened enough to make him sit back down again.\nThat seemed all right with him.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYes\u2014well\u2014and ten years later, in 1970, that same boy would be a notorious homosexual, living away from home in the old Fairchild Hotel. His father, Dwayne Hoover, had disowned him. His mother had become a recluse. He eked out a living as a piano player at night in the Tally-ho Room of the new Holiday Inn.\nI was again what I had been before the fiasco of my play in New York, the all-night man at Schramm\u2019s Drugstore. Father was buried in Calvary Cemetery, not all that far from Eloise Metzger. We buried him in a painter\u2019s smock, and with his left thumb hooked through a palette. Why not?\nThe city had taken the old carriage house for fifteen years of back taxes. The first floor now sheltered the carcasses of trucks and buses which were being cannibalized for parts. The upper floors were dead storage for documents relating to transactions by the city before the First World War.\nMother and I inhabited a little two-bedroom shitbox out in the Maritimo Brothers development known as \u201cAvondale.\u201d Mother and I moved into it about three months after Father died. It was virtually a gift from Gino and Marco Maritimo. We didn\u2019t even have a down payment. Mother and I were both dead broke, and Felix hadn\u2019t started to make really big money yet, and he was about to pay alimony to two ex-wives instead of one. Old Gino and Marco told us to move in anyway, and not to worry. The price they were asking, it turned out, was so far below the actual value of the house that we had no trouble getting a mortgage. It had been a model house, too, which meant it was already landscaped, and there were Venetian blinds already on all the windows, and a flagstone walk running up to the front door, and a post lantern out front, and all sorts of expensive options which most Avondale buyers passed up, like a full basement and genuine tile in the bathroom, and a cedar closet in Mother\u2019s bedroom, and a dishwasher and a garbage disposal unit and a wall oven and a built-in breakfast nook in the kitchen, and a fireplace with an ornate mantelpiece in the living room, and an outdoor barbecue, and an eight-foot cedar fence around the backyard, and on and on.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo, in 1970, at the age of thirty-eight, I was still cooking for my mother, and making her bed every day, and doing her laundry, and so on.

This was it:\nAnd now I drew a symbol whose meaning Dwayne had known for a few years in school, a meaning which had since eluded him. The symbol would have looked like the end of a table in a prison dining hall to Wayne. It represented the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. This ratio could also be expressed as a number, and even as Dwayne and Wayne and Karabekian and Beatrice Keedsler and all the rest of us went about our business, Earthling scientists were monotonously radioing that number into outer space. The idea was to show other inhabited planets, in case they were listening, how intelligent we were. We had tortured circles until they coughed up this symbol of their secret lives:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd I made an invisible duplicate on my Formica tabletop of a painting by Rabo Karabekian, entitled The Temptation of Saint Anthony. My duplicate was a miniature of the real thing, and mine was not in color, but I had captured the picture\u2019s form and the spirit, too. This is what I drew.\nThe original was twenty feet wide and sixteen feet high. The field was Hawaiian Avocado, a green wall paint manufactured by the O\u2019Hare Paint and Varnish Company in Hellertown, Pennsylvania. The vertical stripe was dayglo orange reflecting tape. This was the most expensive piece of art, not counting buildings and tombstones, and not counting the statue of Abraham Lincoln in front of the old Nigger high school.\nIt was a scandal what the painting cost. It was the first purchase for the permanent collection of the Mildred Barry Memorial Center for the Arts. Fred T. Barry, the Chairman of the Board of Barrytron, Ltd., had coughed up fifty thousand dollars of his own for the picture.\nMidland City was outraged.
