That other person was named Salo. He was old. Salo was eleven million Earthling years old.\nSalo was from another galaxy, from the Small Magellanic Cloud. He was four and a half feet tall.\nSalo had a skin with the texture and color of the skin of an Earthling tangerine.\nSalo had three light deer-like legs. His feet were of an extraordinarily interesting design, each being an inflatable sphere. By inflating these spheres to the size of German batballs, Salo could walk on water. By reducing them to the size of golf balls, Salo could bound over hard surfaces at high speeds. When he deflated the spheres entirely, his feet became suction cups. Salo could walk up walls.\nSalo had no arms. Salo had three eyes, and his eyes could perceive not only the so-called visible spectrum, but infrared and ultraviolet and X-rays as well. Salo was punctual\u2014that is, he lived one moment at a time\u2014and he liked to tell Rumfoord that he would rather see the wonderful colors at the far ends of the spectrum than either the past or the future.\nThis was something of a weasel, since Salo had seen, living a moment at a time, far more of the past and far more of the Universe than Rumfoord had. He remembered more of what he had seen, too.\nSalo\u2019s head was round and hung on gimbals.\nHis voice was an electric noise-maker that sounded like a bicycle horn. He spoke five thousand languages, fifty of them Earthling languages, thirty-one of them dead Earthling languages.\nSalo didn\u2019t live in a palace, though Rumfoord had offered to have one built for him. Salo lived in the open, near the space ship that had brought him to Titan two hundred thousand years before. His space ship was a flying saucer, the prototype for the Martian invasion fleet.\nSalo had an interesting history.", 0.11056344696969696], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["feet", 0.031578947368421054], ["frank", 0.031578947368421054], ["papa", 0.031578947368421054], ["room", 0.031578947368421054], ["table", 0.021052631578947368], ["hatbox", 0.021052631578947368], ["bell", 0.021052631578947368], ["anteroom", 0.021052631578947368], ["walls", 0.021052631578947368], ["card", 0.021052631578947368], ["firm", 0.010526315789473684], ["spiritual", 0.010526315789473684], ["square", 0.010526315789473684], ["people", 0.010526315789473684], ["wall", 0.010526315789473684], ["oubliette", 0.010526315789473684], ["von", 0.010526315789473684], ["supported", 0.010526315789473684], ["fata", 0.010526315789473684], ["ready", 0.010526315789473684], ["guard", 0.010526315789473684], ["benches", 0.010526315789473684], ["mirage", 0.010526315789473684], ["listless", 0.010526315789473684], ["chicken", 0.010526315789473684], ["muttered", 0.010526315789473684], ["attendance", 0.010526315789473684], ["stood", 0.010526315789473684], ["floor", 0.010526315789473684], ["pictures", 0.010526315789473684], ["rings", 0.010526315789473684], ["butcher", 0.010526315789473684], ["bench", 0.010526315789473684], ["laid", 0.010526315789473684], ["going", 0.010526315789473684], ["morgana", 0.010526315789473684], ["suite", 0.010526315789473684], ["96", 0.010526315789473684], ["knife", 0.010526315789473684], ["told", 0.010526315789473684], ["flattered", 0.010526315789473684], ["thirty", 0.010526315789473684], ["prosper", 0.010526315789473684], ["christian", 0.010526315789473684], ["electric", 0.010526315789473684], ["torture", 0.010526315789473684], ["chamber", 0.010526315789473684], ["care", 0.010526315789473684], ["ruler", 0.010526315789473684], ["arose", 0.010526315789473684], ["sort", 0.010526315789473684], ["bible", 0.010526315789473684], ["fan", 0.010526315789473684], ["manhole", 0.010526315789473684], ["decorations", 0.010526315789473684], ["half", 0.010526315789473684], ["brass", 0.010526315789473684], ["dr", 0.010526315789473684], ["schlichter", 0.010526315789473684], ["couldn", 0.010526315789473684], ["drilled", 0.010526315789473684], ["physician", 0.010526315789473684], ["stone", 0.010526315789473684], ["lid", 0.010526315789473684], ["rugged", 0.010526315789473684], ["kindly", 0.010526315789473684], ["hour", 0.010526315789473684], ["windows", 0.010526315789473684], ["furnished", 0.010526315789473684], ["cover", 0.010526315789473684], ["holes", 0.010526315789473684], ["wait", 0.010526315789473684], ["asked", 0.010526315789473684], ["book", 0.010526315789473684], ["dinner", 0.010526315789473684], ["intervals", 0.010526315789473684], ["iron", 0.010526315789473684], ["fixed", 0.010526315789473684], ["koenigswald", 0.010526315789473684], ["waited", 0.010526315789473684], ["minister", 0.010526315789473684]], "sentiment": ["And I flattered myself that I was going to be a firm, just, and kindly ruler, and that my people would prosper.\nFata Morgana.\nMirage!\n96\nBELL, BOOK, AND CHICKEN IN A HATBOX\nFRANK AND I couldn\u2019t get right in to see \u201cPapa.\u201d Dr. Schlichter von Koenigswald, the physician in attendance, muttered that we would have to wait about half an hour.\nSo Frank and I waited in the anteroom of \u201cPapa\u2019s\u201d suite, a room without windows.

No sooner were Paul\u2019s hands on the staff than he saw the ranks of his protectors split wide open. Berringer, his head lowered, his thick legs driving, charged him.\nIn the scuffle, Paul swung at the informality-maddened Berringer, missed, and was knocked, hors de combat, off the bandstand and halfway through the kitchen doors.\n\u201cPlease!

One of the cooks, who had been watching with disdain, turned away quickly when Paul looked at him, and disappeared into the big meat locker.\nAs Paul\u2019s teammates carried him back to his seat, he realized fleetingly, as a fragment of a nightmare, that the cook had been Alfy, the master of silent television.\n\u201cNow, now,\u201d said the loudspeaker. \u201cNo more rough stuff, or well have to call off the rest of the fun.

it\u2019s Sunday morning,\" I said. \"We\u2019ve been here twelve hours!\" It was Monday morning.\nThe Western Union boy was thunderstruck. \"Sunday morning? I walked in here on a Sunday night.\" He stared around the room. \"Looks like them newsreels of Buchenwald, don\u2019t it?\"\nThe chief of the Beaver Patrol, with the incredible stamina of the young, was the hero of the day. He fell in his men in two ranks, haranguing them like an old Army top-kick. While the rest of us lay draped around the room, whimpering about hunger, cold, and thirst, the patrol started the furnace again, brought blankets, applied compresses to Fred\u2019s head and countless barked shins, blocked off the broken window, and made buckets of cocoa and coffee.\nWithin two hours of the time that the power and the euphio went off, the house was warm and we had eaten. The serious respiratory cases\u2014the parents who had sat near the broken window for twenty-four hours\u2014had been pumped full of penicillin and hauled off to the hospital. The milkman, the Western Union boy, and the trooper had refused treatment and gone home. The Beaver Patrol had saluted smartly and left. Outside, repairmen were working on the power line. Only the original group remained\u2014Lew, Fred, and Marion, Susan and myself, and Eddie. Fred, it turned out, had some pretty important-looking contusions and abrasions, but no concussion.\nSusan had fallen asleep right after eating.

I know nothing about the negotiations for my story until now. I am embarrassed that those who claim to represent me treated you so badly. That was wrong. You have been a good friend of mine.\nI have been a freelance for a long time, as you know. I have found that the most unpleasant, friendship-straining negotiations always have to do with anthologies. The anthologist invites me to demonstrate whether I am a gentleman or not. My union implores me to hold out for high fees, in order that my brother writers will also be paid well for contributing to anthologies.\nI am not greedy. Also, I am growing old and find myself in need of all the friends I can retain, and I am no longer up to untangling double and triple binds. So I am removing myself from the anthology business entirely. I have already told Rust Hills, for instance, that I do not want to be in an anthology of his on any terms. I am instructing my publisher in the same mail with this letter that nothing of mine is for sale to any anthologist at any price. Word of honor: I do not lust after the money or the fame.\nAs some old man in Plato\u2019s dialogues said about not feeling the sex urge any more: I feel as though I were at last allowed to dismount from a wild horse.\nI hope I have conveyed friendliness somewhere in this business letter, since I like you a lot and admire what you do.\nYours truly,\nKurt Vonnegut, Jr.", 0.09074380165289259], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["harold", 0.15], ["paul", 0.1], ["dad", 0.05], ["selling", 0.05], ["arranged", 0.05], ["die", 0.05], ["cleaners", 0.05], ["amazing", 0.05], ["preparation", 0.05], ["doorway", 0.05], ["mouth", 0.05], ["adventure", 0.05], ["vacuum", 0.05], ["shuttle", 0.05], ["true", 0.05], ["appears", 0.05], ["best", 0.05]], "sentiment": ["HAROLD\nSelling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.\nSHUTTLE\nI just want one true adventure before I die.\nHAROLD\nThat can be arranged.\nPAUL appears at the mouth of the doorway.
