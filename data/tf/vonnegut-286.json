He was professor of English at Webster University in St. Louis and taught courses on the novels of Kurt Vonnegut, Native American literature, and Latin American literature.\nDear Harry\u2014\nI put this in a private letter, since I have a German name, and since I have said that Dresden should not have been bombed, and since there are a lot of people who on scant evidence would like to peg me for a neo-Nazi apologist.\nSomeone must say publicly, however, that holocaust studies, with the best possible intentions, are in danger of making reputable the quack physical anthropology and cultural anthropology of Hitler\u2019s time. Hitler had emotional reasons for wishing to make Jews easily distinguished from the general population of Europe. No reputable scientist then or now could make such a distinction. When I studied anthropology at the University of Chicago immediately after the Second World War, I was told that there was no way a Jew could be described or identified. Jews in Europe were just more Europeans, physically and intellectually. Their skeletons and skulls were just more European skeletons and skulls. Their life stories were just more European life stories. The only way Hitler could find Jews to kill, finally, was to go looking for people who said they were Jews, or who were known to have ancestors who said they were Jews.\nHitler made a harmless admission a capital crime.\nHolocaust studies may again make Jews as seemingly distinctive as Hitler cruelly imagined them to be. It should be remembered, too, that once his quack anthropologists got to work seeking distinctions, they were able to generalize loathsomely about Slavs and Blacks and Gypsies and Homosexuals and on and on.", 0.11085043988269794], "title": "Letters"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["flag", 0.06976744186046512], ["mom", 0.06976744186046512], ["beautiful", 0.023255813953488372], ["agreed", 0.023255813953488372], ["idea", 0.023255813953488372], ["ant", 0.023255813953488372], ["lowe", 0.023255813953488372], ["milk", 0.023255813953488372], ["best", 0.023255813953488372], ["wonder", 0.023255813953488372], ["mccabe", 0.023255813953488372], ["hated", 0.023255813953488372], ["addled", 0.023255813953488372], ["send", 0.023255813953488372], ["balled", 0.023255813953488372], ["crying", 0.023255813953488372], ["poet", 0.023255813953488372], ["regrets", 0.023255813953488372], ["fool", 0.023255813953488372], ["plant", 0.023255813953488372], ["hazel", 0.023255813953488372], ["plans", 0.023255813953488372], ["farm", 0.023255813953488372], ["frank", 0.023255813953488372], ["men", 0.023255813953488372], ["wishes", 0.023255813953488372], ["124", 0.023255813953488372], ["peak", 0.023255813953488372], ["mice", 0.023255813953488372], ["true", 0.023255813953488372], ["younger", 0.023255813953488372], ["saddest", 0.023255813953488372], ["mount", 0.023255813953488372], ["studied", 0.023255813953488372], ["thing", 0.023255813953488372], ["good", 0.023255813953488372], ["place", 0.023255813953488372], ["finishing", 0.023255813953488372], ["spilt", 0.023255813953488372]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI wish now I\u2019d studied everything more.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all got regrets, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cNo use crying over spilt milk.\u201d\n\u201cAs the poet said, Mom, \u2018Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, \u201cIt might have been.\u201d \u2019\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so beautiful, and so true.\u201d\n124\nFRANK\u2019S ANT FARM\nI HATED TO SEE HAZEL finishing the flag, because I was all balled up in her addled plans for it.

They seem to be scared to death of us, though being scared of amphibians makes as much sense as being scared of the sunrise. They could have the whole world, except the storage centers, for all the amphibians care. But they bunch together as though we were going to come whooping out of the sky and do something terrible to them at any moment.\nThey\u2019ve got contraptions all over the place that are supposed to detect amphibians. The gadgets aren\u2019t worth a nickel, but they seem to make the enemy feel good\u2014like they were lined up against great forces, but keeping their nerve and doing important, clever things about it. Know-how\u2014all the time they\u2019re patting each other about how much know-how they\u2019ve got, and about how we haven\u2019t got anything by comparison. If know-how means weapons, they\u2019re dead right.\nI guess there is a war on between them and us. But we never do anything about holding up our side of the war, except to keep our parade sites and our storage centers secret, and to get out of bodies every time there\u2019s an air raid, or the enemy fires a rocket, or something.\nThat just makes the enemy madder, because the raids and rockets and all cost plenty, and blowing up things nobody needs anyway is a poor return on the taxpayer\u2019s money. We always know what they\u2019re going to do next, and when and where, so there isn\u2019t any trick to keeping out of their way.\nBut they are pretty smart, considering they\u2019ve got bodies to look after besides doing their thinking, so I always try to be cautious when I go over to watch them. That\u2019s why I wanted to clear out when Madge and I saw a storage center in the middle of one of their fields. We hadn\u2019t talked to anybody lately about what the enemy was up to, and the center looked awfully suspicious.\nMadge was optimistic, the way she\u2019s been ever since she borrowed that burlesque queen\u2019s body, and she said the storage center was a sure sign that the enemy had seen the light, that they were getting ready to become amphibious themselves.\nWell, it looked like it. There was a brand-new center, stocked with bodies and open for business, as innocent as you please. We circled it several times, and Madge\u2019s circles got smaller and smaller, as she tried to get a close look at what they had in the way of ladies\u2019 ready-to-wear.\n\"Let\u2019s beat it,\" I said.\n\"I\u2019m just looking,\" said Madge. \"No harm in looking.\"\nThen she saw what was in the main display case, and she forgot where she was or where she\u2019d come from.", 0.0373809523809524], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["woodly", 0.06451612903225806], ["going", 0.06451612903225806], ["harold", 0.06451612903225806], ["hurt", 0.06451612903225806], ["pocketknife", 0.03225806451612903], ["quietly", 0.03225806451612903], ["years", 0.03225806451612903], ["discovered", 0.03225806451612903], ["violent", 0.03225806451612903], ["ridiculous", 0.03225806451612903], ["armed", 0.03225806451612903], ["botanist", 0.03225806451612903], ["1893", 0.03225806451612903], ["will", 0.03225806451612903], ["languages", 0.03225806451612903], ["famous", 0.03225806451612903], ["explored", 0.03225806451612903], ["analyzed", 0.03225806451612903], ["talent", 0.03225806451612903], ["kindness", 0.03225806451612903], ["magic", 0.03225806451612903], ["blankly", 0.03225806451612903], ["harvard", 0.03225806451612903], ["jungle", 0.03225806451612903], ["quixote", 0.03225806451612903], ["root", 0.03225806451612903], ["gesture", 0.03225806451612903]], "sentiment": ["WOODLY\nThe magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.
