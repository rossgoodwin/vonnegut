He wrote and produced the movie based on Mother Night, starring Nick Nolte.\nDear Robert Weide\u2014\nI\u2019ve been out of town for most of this summer, and so read your friendly letter of a month ago only this morning. It turns out that I already know something of your work. I saw the Marx Brothers tribute, and liked it a lot. Who wouldn\u2019t?\nI am honored by your interest in my work, and I will talk to you some, if you like, about making some sort of film based on it. But there is sure no great footage to start with. Slaughterhouse-Five is the only good movie having anything to do with me. Also: Harold Mantell made a documentary of me mostly talking seven years ago or so, which he rents out to schools. You might take a look at that. And a movie based on Slapstick, starring Jerry Lewis and Madeline Kahn as twins, has just been completed out there by Steven Paul Productions, whose number must be in the phonebook. He\u2019s on Hollywood Boulevard. I left my address book out in the country. Maybe Steven will show you some of it. It could be awful. I haven\u2019t seen any of it yet.\nAnything that is any good of mine is on a printed page, not film. Maybe you have some ideas as to what to do about that. I don\u2019t.
