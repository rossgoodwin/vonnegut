Army and sent to Dresden, where he survived the firebombing of the city in an underground meat locker with other prisoners. He wrote in his \u201cbiographical\u201d letter to Klinkowitz that \u201cpractically all my fellow prisoners were stockpiled in ASTP. Our own suspicion afterwards, since we had so little ammunition and were still awaiting winter equipment, and never saw an American plane or tank, and were not warned that the Germans were massing large numbers of tanks for one last major attack, is that the 106th was bait in a trap. In chess this is called a gambit. Take the exposed pawn and you\u2019ve lost the game.\u201d\nKurt\u2019s lifelong friend Victor Jose, who went to Swarthmore with Jane Cox, believes that when Kurt was home on leave in 1944 he went to see Jane, whom he had met in kindergarten and dated when they went to Shortridge High School together. Victor remembers that Kurt \u201cappeared on the scene just in time\u201d to persuade her to break off her relationship with a college boyfriend and wait for him till he came home from the war. Kurt later wrote a fictionalized version of such an encounter in his short story \u201cLong Walk to Forever\u201d (collected in Welcome to the Monkey House).\nAfter being honorably discharged from the Army in July of 1945 and awarded the Purple Heart, Kurt married Jane that September in a Quaker ceremony (Jane and her family were Quakers). A voracious reader, Jane had graduated from Swarthmore College as a Phi Beta Kappa the year before and was awarded a prize for having the best personal library of any graduating student. Kurt later told a friend that the books Jane brought to their marriage were her \u201cdowry.\u201d Kurt wrote in Fates Worse Than Death that, during their honeymoon, \u201cShe had me read The Brothers Karamazov.\u2026 She considered it the greatest of all novels.\u201d\nKurt and Jane were both accepted into graduate programs at the University of Chicago and moved to that city in December of 1945. (Jane dropped out of her classes in Slavic languages and literature when she became pregnant in 1946.) Like many returning veterans, Kurt used his G.I. Bill to supplement his education, studying for a master\u2019s degree in anthropology, and also worked as a reporter at the Chicago News Bureau. When his thesis was rejected\u2014a comparative study of the Ghost Dance Society of the Plains Indians and the Cubist painters\u2014and his first son, Mark, was born in 1947, Kurt decided to drop out and apply for jobs to support his family. (Their daughter Edith was added two years later, and their third child and second daughter, Nanette, was born in 1954.) Kurt turned down an offer from Bobbs-Merrill publishers in Indianapolis to accept a position in public relations for General Electric in Schenectady, New York, where his older brother, Bernard, worked as an atmospheric physicist. The pay was better, and both Kurt and Jane wanted a change of scene. Kurt\u2019s classmate Victor Jose told me that \u201cIf they stayed in Indianapolis, they feared that Jane would be expected by her family to join the Junior League, and she and Kurt didn\u2019t like that \u2018socialite\u2019 kind of life. They both were rebels even then.\u201d\nWorking in public relations by day, Kurt wrote short stories at night and on weekends and sent them out to the leading popular and well-paying magazines of the era. This was \u201cthe golden age of magazines,\u201d when William Faulkner published stories in Collier\u2019s, F. Scott Fitzgerald appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, John Steinbeck in the Woman\u2019s Home Companion, and Ernest Hemingway in Esquire. Four weeklies and six monthlies published three or four stories in every issue, and \u201cthe Vonnegut boy\u201d was able to make a (precarious) living, support his family, and begin his career as a writer, selling short stories to those magazines.\nUnlike his mother\u2019s failed efforts in the same enterprise, Vonnegut succeeded. The break came when Knox Burger, a Cornell graduate who\u2019d gone on to become fiction editor at Collier\u2019s magazine, recognized Kurt\u2019s name on a story submission. He asked in a scrawled note at the bottom of a rejection slip if he was the Kurt Vonnegut who\u2019d gone to Cornell and written for The Cornell Sun. It turned out to be the start of a relationship that led to acceptance of his first short story and launched his career as a writer.\nMay 29, 1945\n[Le Havre]\nFROM: PFC. K.

For a quick sample of how good it can be, a visitor might stop off at St. Mary\u2019s Church on Main Street, which has, unadvertised anywhere, the most enchanting church garden in America. The garden is the work of one man, Robert Nicholson, an Episcopalian minister, a good man who died young.\nAt a village cocktail party one time\u2014and the villagers do drink a lot\u2014Father Nicholson was talking to a Roman Catholic and a Jew, trying to find a word to describe the underlying spiritual unity of Barnstable.

They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.\nSome things about living still weren\u2019t quite right, though. April, for instance, still drove people crazy by not being springtime. And it was in that clammy month that the H-G men took George and Hazel Bergeron\u2019s fourteen-year-old son, Harrison, away.\nIt was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn\u2019t think about it very hard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn\u2019t think about anything except in short bursts. And George, while his intelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his ear. He was required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains.\nGeorge and Hazel were watching television. There were tears on Hazel\u2019s cheeks, but she\u2019d forgotten for the moment what they were about.\nOn the television screen were ballerinas.\nA buzzer sounded in George\u2019s head.

Quite simply, for it puts at finger tips a symbol that was never used on a typewriter before the Third German Reich, a symbol that will never be used on a typewriter again.\nThe symbol is the twin lightning strokes used for the dreaded S.S., the Schutzstaffel, the most fanatical wing of Nazism.\nI used such a typewriter in Germany all through the war. Whenever I had occasion to write of the Schutzstaffel, which I did often and with enthusiasm, I never abbreviated it as \u201cS.S.,\u201d but always struck the typewriter key for the far more frightening and magical twin lightning strokes.\nAncient history.\nI am surrounded by ancient history.

experience I am almost literally heartbroken that there was no way for me to take a tape recorder down the blue tunnel to Heaven and back again. Never before had there been a New Orleans\u2013style brass band, led by the late Louis Armstrong, to greet a new arrival with a rousing rendition of \u201cWhen the Saints Come Marching In.\u201d The recipient of this very rare and merry honor, accorded to only one in ten million newly dead people, I\u2019m told, was an Australian Aborigine, with some white blood, named Birnum Birnum.\nWhen white settlers came in the nineteenth century, the natives of Australia and nearby Tasmania had the simplest and most primitive cultures of any people then on Earth. They were regarded as vermin, with no more minds and souls than rats, say. They were shot; they were poisoned. Only in 1967, practically the day before yesterday, were the surviving Australian Aborigines granted citizenship, thanks to demonstrations led by Birnum Birnum. He was the first of his people to attend law school.\nThere were no survivors on Tasmania. I asked him for a sound bite about the Tasmanians to take back to WNYC. He said they were victims of the only completely successful genocide of which we know. Louis Armstrong broke into our conversation to say the Tasmanians were as gifted and intelligent as anybody, given good teachers. Two members of his current band, he said, were Tasmanians. One played clarinet; the other one played a mean gutbucket, or slide trombone.\nThis is Kurt Vonnegut, WNYC\u2019s reporter on the Afterlife, signing off.\ntoday\u2019s controlled near-death\nexperience was a real honey! I interviewed John Brown\u2014whose body lies a-moulderin\u2019 in the grave, but whose truth goes marchin\u2019 on. One hundred forty years ago, come October 2, he was hanged for treason against the United States of America. At the head of a force of only eighteen other antislavery fanatics, he captured the virtually unguarded Federal Armory at Harper\u2019s Ferry, Virginia. His plan? To pass out weapons to slaves, so they could overthrow their masters. Suicide.\nLaw-abiding citizens opened fire from all sides, killing eight of his men, two of them his sons. He himself was taken prisoner by a force of United States Marines, sworn to uphold the Constitution. Their commander was Colonel Robert E. Lee.\nJohn Brown wears a hangman\u2019s noose for a necktie up in Heaven. I asked him about it, and he said, \u201cWhere\u2019s yours? Where\u2019s yours?\u201d\nHis eyes were like glowing coins. \u201cWithout shedding of blood,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no remission of sin.\u201d It turns out that\u2019s in the New Testament, Hebrews 9:22.", 0.1115465258647077], "title": "God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian"}, "we-are-what-we-pretend-to-be": {"tfidf": [["chair", 0.10805128066901548], ["care", 0.09415434675431143], ["nearer", 0.07115256990224895], ["arm", 0.05819654783570793], ["simply", 0.05402564033450774], ["haley", 0.0477743583033033], ["yessir", 0.0477364396499991], ["turtle", 0.042054295984394995], ["fetched", 0.042054295984394995], ["slap", 0.042054295984394995], ["gaped", 0.042054295984394995], ["cares", 0.042054295984394995], ["grasping", 0.042054295984394995], ["ducked", 0.042054295984394995], ["instinctively", 0.042054295984394995], ["chanted", 0.042054295984394995], ["shelter", 0.042054295984394995], ["intrude", 0.042054295984394995], ["disturbance", 0.042054295984394995], ["scuffled", 0.042054295984394995], ["uncle", 0.042054295984394995], ["jovially", 0.042054295984394995], ["scare", 0.042054295984394995], ["man", 0.04153699802271218], ["bobbed", 0.03557628495112448], ["hiding", 0.03557628495112448], ["add", 0.03557628495112448], ["repeat", 0.03557628495112448], ["bully", 0.03557628495112448], ["sheepishly", 0.03557628495112448], ["thrust", 0.03557628495112448], ["bared", 0.03557628495112448], ["interrupted", 0.03557628495112448], ["movies", 0.03557628495112448], ["slow", 0.03178689141740332], ["seized", 0.03178689141740332], ["glare", 0.03178689141740332], ["smiled", 0.03178689141740332], ["stairs", 0.03178689141740332], ["wheeled", 0.03178689141740332], ["chuckled", 0.03178689141740332], ["upstairs", 0.029098273917853964], ["foot", 0.029098273917853964], ["eh", 0.029098273917853964], ["hoped", 0.029098273917853964], ["month", 0.02701282016725387], ["thoughtfully", 0.02701282016725387], ["wonderful", 0.02701282016725387], ["marched", 0.02701282016725387], ["yelled", 0.02701282016725387], ["brandon", 0.0253088803841328], ["smile", 0.0253088803841328], ["cousin", 0.0253088803841328], ["happen", 0.0253088803841328], ["smart", 0.02386821982499955], ["ardennes", 0.02262026288458345], ["big", 0.02262026288458345], ["sir", 0.02151948685041164], ["hurt", 0.02151948685041164], ["teeth", 0.02151948685041164], ["understand", 0.02053480913398336], ["supper", 0.02053480913398336], ["family", 0.019644059790017702], ["girls", 0.019644059790017702], ["walked", 0.018830869350862284], ["red", 0.018082806662324563], ["sort", 0.018082806662324563], ["bad", 0.01739020879172903], ["tonight", 0.01739020879172903], ["great", 0.01739020879172903], ["sunroom", 0.016142251851312933], ["general", 0.015924786101101103], ["call", 0.015575666600692045], ["farm", 0.015041475817141122], ["high", 0.013166048756747187], ["hope", 0.012143216235891707], ["house", 0.01197134435011275], ["young", 0.01197134435011275], ["turned", 0.01197134435011275], ["thing", 0.010584241498540103], ["looked", 0.009376655223026028]], "sentiment": ["Haley gaped as the man seized Hope by the arm and fetched her a smart slap on her behind. \u201cDidn\u2019t hurt,\u201d she yelled.

"sentiment": ["It was certainly to the General\u2019s credit as a man of compassion that he should understand the importance of music to his new charge, Haley thought, for the man was as tone-deaf as a sparrow, and so were two of his three daughters. Judging from the whistling and humming they did, only Hope was able to carry a tune. Haley had heard that this was a hereditary trait. His mother, or, as Annie had reminded him, his foster mother, had been similarly afflicted. In this thought Haley found some consolation for his not being a blood relative of the Cooleys. There were apparently no instruments on the farm, and the evening\u2019s choice of radio programs had indicated that the General and his family found homicide far more entertaining than music. As Haley had undressed for bed, he had been surprised to hear an excellent, if untrained, tenor voice singing hymns in the barn, and had wondered who it might have been. It could not have been a Cooley, at any rate. He decided to ask about it in the morning.\nTomorrow his new life would begin in earnest, in the vast, unfamiliar flatness of the Plain \u2014 a world of strange sounds and sights and attitudes. He was, the General had said, to help with the haying.\nHe turned over, pulled the sheet over his head, and closed his eyes. Haley dreamed of saying goodnight to his mother and father, of wishing them, handsome and young in evening clothes, a pleasant time at their party. He dreamed of the friends who had come to get him the next morning, to tell him that he must stay with them for a little while, that there had been an automobile accident, that he mustn\u2019t cry, that he must be a man\u2026. He had cried.\nIII.\nHaley was awakened the next morning by a banging on his door, a shout by his ear, and the shock of a cold washcloth on his face. He sat upright, and saw the General standing at the foot of the cot, squat, fat, and laughing. A towel was knotted about the man\u2019s abdomen; with another he was rubbing his bare chest to a glowing pink. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the music business, boy; you\u2019re a farmer now. Take a cold shower, and be down for breakfast in ten minutes, or you don\u2019t eat,\u201d he trumpeted.\n\u201cYessir,\u201d said Haley. Ten minutes later he was seated, puffing and shivering, at the long kitchen table, ducking his head now and then to avoid the flying elbows of Annie, who was energetically making flapjacks on the range behind him. The hot water faucet in the shower stall had been a cruel fraud, he reflected resentfully. The glare from the naked bulb that hung over the table hurt his eyes. He looked away from it to the blackness outside the windows, and realized with sleepy awe that he would be seeing a sunrise for the first time in his life. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, after waiting fruitlessly for someone \u2014 Annie, Hope, or the General \u2014 to acknowledge his presence.\nThe General and Hope sat across the table from him. Both gave him cursory nods. Hope\u2019s expression was sullen, and the General\u2019s boisterous spirits of a few minutes ago seemed to have fled. Haley supposed that they were still nourishing the unpleasantness of the previous afternoon. Uncomfortable in that sort of silence, Haley tried to break it again. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice morning,\u201d he said.\nThe General looked up. \u201cBrush your teeth this morning, boy?\u201d\n\u201cYessir.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the General firmly. \u201cDirtiest place in the world, next to the fingernails, the human mouth is.\u201d", 0.02829496891996891], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["chicago", 0.10180333109425327], ["teaching", 0.09378093152925092], ["sandy", 0.09378093152925092], ["shift", 0.09378093152925092], ["supported", 0.07324612239526757], ["department", 0.07324612239526757], ["police", 0.060290100328726524], ["listing", 0.04689046576462546], ["michigan", 0.04689046576462546], ["coast", 0.04689046576462546], ["recorded", 0.04689046576462546], ["reporter", 0.04689046576462546], ["anthropology", 0.04689046576462546], ["search", 0.04689046576462546], ["stations", 0.04689046576462546], ["likes", 0.04689046576462546], ["courts", 0.04689046576462546], ["anthropologist", 0.04689046576462546], ["ap", 0.04689046576462546], ["villain", 0.04689046576462546], ["institutions", 0.04689046576462546], ["dog", 0.04583795288511004], ["switched", 0.04041245473135494], ["sooner", 0.04041245473135494], ["pneumatic", 0.04041245473135494], ["deal", 0.04041245473135494], ["streets", 0.04041245473135494], ["asks", 0.04041245473135494], ["studying", 0.04041245473135494], ["student", 0.04041245473135494], ["talk", 0.03687397007647666], ["difference", 0.03662306119763378], ["disgusting", 0.03662306119763378], ["program", 0.03662306119763378], ["drinking", 0.03662306119763378], ["university", 0.03662306119763378], ["bureau", 0.03662306119763378], ["newspapers", 0.03662306119763378], ["operator", 0.03662306119763378], ["shortly", 0.03662306119763378], ["cover", 0.03662306119763378], ["tubes", 0.03662306119763378], ["college", 0.033934443698084425], ["music", 0.033934443698084425], ["education", 0.033934443698084425], ["roses", 0.033934443698084425], ["smell", 0.033934443698084425], ["mustard", 0.033934443698084425], ["radio", 0.031848989947484335], ["ridiculous", 0.031848989947484335], ["town", 0.031848989947484335], ["straight", 0.031848989947484335], ["boston", 0.031848989947484335], ["week", 0.031848989947484335], ["connected", 0.031848989947484335], ["sixteen", 0.030145050164363262], ["taught", 0.030145050164363262], ["stand", 0.030145050164363262], ["absolutely", 0.028704389605230005], ["lake", 0.028704389605230005], ["listen", 0.028704389605230005], ["sir", 0.028704389605230005], ["guard", 0.027456432664813908], ["turn", 0.027456432664813908], ["wrote", 0.026355656630642103], ["worked", 0.026355656630642103], ["dollars", 0.026355656630642103], ["mind", 0.026355656630642103], ["hours", 0.025370978914213818], ["news", 0.024480229570248167], ["gas", 0.024480229570248167], ["time", 0.023747783257609067], ["second", 0.02291897644255502], ["learned", 0.02291897644255502], ["twenty", 0.02291897644255502], ["bad", 0.022226378571959488], ["york", 0.021581585380492655], ["fire", 0.021581585380492655], ["story", 0.02097842163154339], ["working", 0.020411836380922505], ["city", 0.01937234446400452], ["died", 0.01937234446400452], ["wife", 0.0188929678809433], ["famous", 0.01843698503823833], ["father", 0.016440965409284507], ["bed", 0.014797127404951196], ["things", 0.014212825003256485], ["day", 0.013662913788088883], ["night", 0.013662913788088883], ["good", 0.013143569384772893], ["thing", 0.012894333430734003], ["war", 0.012347121684585655], ["told", 0.009610241030379905]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir.

Sometimes I don\u2019t know, and I say, \u201cSearch me.\u201d\nI think about my education sometimes. I went to the University of Chicago for a while after the Second World War. I was a student in the Department of Anthropology. At that time, they were teaching that there was absolutely no difference between anybody. They may be teaching that still.\nAnother thing they taught was that nobody was ridiculous or bad or disgusting. Shortly before my father died, he said to me, \u201cYou know\u2014you never wrote a story with a villain in it.\u201d\nI told him that was one of the things I learned in college after the war.\nWhile I was studying to be an anthropologist, I was also working as a police reporter for the famous Chicago City News Bureau for twenty-eight dollars a week.

Mrs. Rumfoord\u2019s husband had insisted on her doing something very much against her own judgment, and she in turn was insisting that Malachi Constant behave, as best he could, like the gentleman he was not.\nMalachi Constant had never been to Titan. He had never, so far as he knew, been outside the gaseous envelope of his native planet, the Earth. Apparently he was about to learn otherwise.\nThe turns in the path were many, and the visibility was short. Constant was following a damp green path the width of a lawn mower\u2014what was in fact the swath of a lawn mower. Rising on both sides of the path were the green walls of the jungle the gardens had become.\nThe mower\u2019s swath skirted a dry fountain. The man who ran the mower had become creative at this point, had made the path fork. Constant could choose the side of the fountain on which he preferred to pass. Constant stopped at the fork, looked up. The fountain itself was marvelously creative. It was a cone described by many stone bowls of decreasing diameters. The bowls were collars on a cylindrical shaft forty feet high.\nImpulsively, Constant chose neither one fork nor the other, but climbed the fountain itself He climbed from bowl to bowl, intending when he got to the top to see whence he had come and whither he was bound.\nStanding now in the topmost, in the smallest of the baroque fountain\u2019s bowls, standing with his feet in the ruins of birds\u2019 nests, Malachi Constant looked out over the estate, and over a large part of Newport and Narragansett Bay. He held up his watch to sunlight, letting it drink in the wherewithal that was to solar watches what money was to Earth men.\nThe freshening sea breeze ruffled Constant\u2019s blue-black hair. He was a well-made man\u2014a light heavyweight, dark-skinned, with poet\u2019s lips, with soft brown eyes in the shaded caves of a Cro-Magnon brow-ridge. He was thirty-one.\nHe was worth three billion dollars, much of it inherited.\nHis name meant faithful messenger.\nHe was a speculator, mostly in corporate securities.", 0.14699855699855702], "title":

Every primitive society ever studied has had a puberty ceremony, at which former children became unchallengeably women and men. Some Jewish communities still honor this old practice, of course, and benefit from it, in my opinion. But, by and large, ultramodern, massively industrialized societies like ours have decided to do without puberty ceremonies\u2014unless you want to count the issuance of drivers\u2019 licenses at the age of 16. If you want to count that as a puberty ceremony, then it has a highly unusual feature: a judge can take your puberty away again, even if you\u2019re as old as I am.\nAnother event in the lives of American and European males which might be considered a puberty ceremony is war. If a male comes home from a war, especially with serious wounds, everybody agrees: Here indeed is a man. When I came home to Indianapolis from the Second World War in Germany, an uncle of mine said to me, \u201cBy golly\u2014you look like a man now.\u201d I wanted to strangle him. If I had, he would have been the first German I\u2019d killed. I was a man before I went to war, but he was damned if he would say so.\nI suggest to you that the withholding of a puberty ceremony from young males in our society is a scheme, devised cunningly but subconsciously, to make those males eager to go to war, no matter how terrible or unjust a war may be. There are just wars, too, of course. The war I was eager to go to happened to be a just one.\nAnd when does a female stop being a little girl and become a woman, with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto? We all know the answer in our bones: When she has a baby in wedlock, of course. If she has that first baby out of wedlock, she is still a child. What could be simpler or more natural and more obvious than that\u2014or, in these days and in this society, at least, more unjust, irrelevant, and just plain stupid?\nI think we had better, for our own safety, reinstate puberty ceremonies.\nI not only pronounce those about to graduate as women and men. With all the powers vested in me, I pronounce them Clarks, as well. Most of you know, I\u2019m sure, that all white people named Clark are descended from inhabitants of the British Isles who were remarkable for being able to read and write. A black person named Clark, of course, would be descended, most likely, from someone who was forced to work without pay or rights of any kind by a white person named Clark. An interesting family\u2014the Clarks.\nI realize that you graduates are all specialized in some way. But you have spent most of the past sixteen or more years learning to read and write. People who can do those things well, as you can, are miracles and, in my opinion, entitle us to suspect that we may be civilized after all. It is terribly hard to learn to read and write. It takes simply forever. When we scold our schoolteachers about the low reading scores of their students, we pretend that it is the easiest thing in the world: To teach a person to read and write. Try it sometime, and you will discover that it is nearly impossible.\nWhat good is being a Clark, now that we have computers and movies and television? Clarking, a wholly human enterprise, is sacred. Machinery is not. Clarking is the most profound and effective form of meditation practiced on this planet, and far surpasses any dream experienced by a Hindu on a mountaintop. Why? Because Clarks, by reading well, can think the thoughts of the wisest and most interesting human minds throughout all history. When Clarks meditate, even if they themselves have only mediocre intellects, they do it with the thoughts of angels. What could be more sacred than that?\nSo much for puberty and Clarking. Only two major subjects remain to be covered: Loneliness and boredom.

But scientists using their big brains and cunning instruments had by 1986 made maps of the ocean floor. There wasn\u2019t a trace, they said, of an intervening land mass of any kind.\nOther people back in that era of big brains and fancy thinking asserted that the islands had once been part of the mainland, and had been split off by some stupendous catastrophe.\nBut the islands didn\u2019t look as though they had been split off from anything. They were clearly young volcanoes, which had been vomited up right where they were. Many of them were such newborns out there that they could be expected to blow again at any time. Back in 1986, they hadn\u2019t even sprouted much coral yet, and so were without blue lagoons and white beaches, amenities many human beings used to regard as foretastes of an ideal afterlife.\nA million years later, they do possess white beaches and blue lagoons. But when this story begins, they were still ugly humps and domes and cones and spires of lava, brittle and abrasive, whose cracks and pits and bowls and valleys brimmed over not with rich topsoil or sweet water, but with the finest, driest volcanic ash.\nAnother theory back then was that God Almighty had created all those creatures where the explorers found them, so they had had no need for transportation.\nAnother theory was that they had been shooed ashore there two by two\u2014down the gangplank of Noah\u2019s ark.\nIf there really was a Noah\u2019s ark, and there may have been\u2014I

happen.\nThe members of my other big synthetic family, the Abstract Expressionists, are mostly dead now, having been killed by everything from mere old age to suicide. The few survivors, like my blood relatives, no longer speak to me.\n\u201cSo be it! So be it!\u201d I cry in this manicured wilderness. \u201cWho gives a damn!\u201d Excuse this outburst.\nAll of our servants quit soon after Edith died. They said it had simply become too lonely here. So I hired some new ones, paying them a great deal of money to put up with me and all the loneliness. When Edith was alive, and the house was alive, the gardener and the two maids and the cook all lived here. Now only the cook, and, as I say, a different cook, lives in, and has the entire servants\u2019 quarters on the third floor of the ell to herself and her fifteen-year-old daughter. She is a divorced woman, a native of East Hampton, about forty, I would say. Her daughter. Celeste, does no work for me, but simply lives here and eats my food, and entertains her loud and willfully ignorant friends on my tennis courts and in my swimming pool and on my private oceanfront.\nShe and her friends ignore me, as though I were a senile veteran from some forgotten war, daydreaming away what little remains of his life as a museum guard. Why should I be offended? This house, in addition to being a home, shelters what is the most important collection of Abstract Expressionist paintings still in private hands. Since I have done no useful work for decades, what else am I, really, but a museum guard?\nAnd, just as a paid museum guard would have to do, I answer as best I can the question put to me by visitor after visitor, stated in various ways, of course: \u201cWhat are these pictures supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThese paintings, which are about absolutely nothing but themselves, were my own property long before I married Edith. They are worth at least as much as all the real estate and stocks and bonds, including a one-quarter share in the Cincinnati Bengals professional football team, which Edith left to me. So I cannot be stigmatized as an American fortune-hunter.\nI may have been a lousy painter, but what a collector I turned out to be!\n2", 0.06704545454545457], "title": "Bluebeard"},

This book combines the tidal power of a major novel with the bone-rattling immediacy of front-line journalism\u2014which is old stuff now, God knows, God knows. But I have also intertwined the flashy enthusiasms of musical theater, the lethal left jab of the short story, the sachet of personal letters, the oompah of American history, and oratory in the bow-wow style.\nThis book is so broad and deep that it reminds me of my brother Bernard\u2019s early experiments with radio. He built a transmitter of his own invention, and he hooked it up to a telegraph key, and he turned it on. He called up our cousin Richard, about two miles away, and he told Richard to listen to his radio, to tune it back and forth across the band, to see if he could pick up my brother\u2019s signals anywhere. They were both about fifteen.\nMy brother tapped out an easily recognizable message, sending it again and again and again. It was \u201cSOS.\u201d This was in Indianapolis, the world\u2019s largest city not on a navigable waterway.\nCousin Richard telephoned back. He was thrilled. He said that Bernard\u2019s signals were loud and clear simply everywhere on the radio band, drowning out music or news or drama, or whatever the commercial stations were putting out at the time.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis is certainly that kind of masterpiece, and a new name should be created for such an all-frequencies assault on the sensibilities. I propose the name blivit. This is a word which during my adolescence was defined by peers as \u201ctwo pounds of shit in a one-pound bag.\u201d\nI would not mind if books simpler than this one, but combining fiction and fact, were also called blivits. This would encourage The New York Times Book Review to establish a third category for best sellers, one long needed, in my opinion. If there were a separate list for blivits, then authors of blivits could stop stepping in the faces of mere novelists and historians and so on.\nUntil that happy day, however, I insist, as only a great author can, that this book be ranked in both the fiction and nonfiction competitions. As for the Pulitzer prizes: this book should be eligible for a mega-grand slam, sweeping fiction, drama, history, biography, and journalism. We will wait and see.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis book is not only a blivit but a collage. It began with my wish to collect in one volume most of the reviews and speeches and essays I had written since the publication of a similar collection, Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons, in 1974. But as I arranged those fragments in this order and then that one, I saw that they formed a sort of autobiography, especially if I felt free to include some pieces not written by me. To give life to such a golem, however, I would have to write much new connective tissue.

eyelids get all droopy.\u201d\nJenny and George were starting their first show of the day when I got out to the Hoosier Appliance Mart. It was a swell morning. George was on the sidewalk in the sunshine, leaning on the fender of the moving van that had Jenny\u2019s brains in it. He and Jenny were singing a duet. They were singing the \u201cIndian Love Call.\u201d They were pretty good. George would sing, \u201cI\u2019ll be calling you-hoo,\u201d in a gravel baritone. Then Jenny would answer back from the doorway of the Mart in a thin, girlish soprano.\nSully Harris, who owned the Mart, was standing by Jenny with one arm draped over her. He was smoking a cigar and counting the house.\nGeorge had on the dress suit and yellow spats Hal Flourish had laughed so hard about. George\u2019s coattails dragged on the ground. His white vest was buttoned down around his knees. His shirt bosom was rolled up under his chin like a window blind. And he had on trick shoes that looked like bare feet the size of canoe paddles. The toenails were painted fire-engine red.\nBut Hal Flourish is the kind of man who thinks anything that\u2019s supposed to be funny is funny. George wasn\u2019t funny if you looked at him closely. And I had to look at him closely because I wasn\u2019t there for a good time. I was bringing him sad news. I looked at him closely, and I saw a small man getting on in years and all alone in this vale of tears. I saw a small man with a big nose and brown eyes that were just sick about something.\nBut most people in the crowd thought he was a howl. Just here and there you\u2019d see a few people who saw what I saw. Their smiles weren\u2019t making fun of George. Their smiles were kind of queer and sweet. Their smiles mostly seemed to ask how Jenny worked.\nJenny was radio-controlled, and the controls were in those trick shoes of George\u2019s\u2014under his toes. He would punch buttons with his toes, and the shoes would send out signals to Jenny\u2019s brains in the moving van. Then the brains would signal Jenny what to do. There weren\u2019t any wires between Jenny and George and the van.\nIt was hard to believe George had anything to do with what Jenny was up to. He had a little pink earphone in his ear, so he could hear everything anybody said to Jenny, even when she was a hundred feet away. And he had little rearview mirrors on the frames of his glasses, so he could turn his back to her and still see everything she did.\nWhen they stopped singing, Jenny picked me out to kid around with. \u201cHello, tall, dark, and handsome,\u201d she said to me. \u201cDid the old icebox drive you out of the house?\u201d She had a sponge rubber face at the top of the door, with springs embedded in it and a loudspeaker behind it. Her face was so real, I almost had to believe there was a beautiful woman inside the refrigerator\u2014with her face stuck through a hole in the door.\nI kidded her back. \u201cLook, Mrs. Frankenstein,\u201d I said to her, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go off in a corner somewhere and make some ice cubes? I want to have a private talk with your boss.\u201d", 0.08685966810966812], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["german", 0.12114465609090264], ["cottages", 0.10934649294967166], ["homes", 0.08669469318331888], ["family", 0.08278218730122666], ["american", 0.08239940964259228], ["summer", 0.07616220609536031], ["thousands", 0.07616220609536031], ["war", 0.061870511650825355], ["silverware", 0.05467324647483583], ["comfortable", 0.05467324647483583], ["businesses", 0.05467324647483583], ["paraguay", 0.05467324647483583], ["unsheathed", 0.05467324647483583], ["deprived", 0.05467324647483583], ["tens", 0.05467324647483583], ["europe", 0.05467324647483583], ["eastern", 0.05467324647483583], ["owned", 0.05467324647483583], ["crippled", 0.05467324647483583], ["inherit", 0.05467324647483583], ["honest", 0.05467324647483583], ["hatred", 0.05467324647483583], ["dealing", 0.04752739925256835], ["encouraged", 0.04752739925256835], ["village", 0.04752739925256835], ["depression", 0.04752739925256835], ["literature", 0.04752739925256835], ["wander", 0.04752739925256835], ["permanently", 0.04752739925256835], ["taught", 0.04752739925256835], ["reputations", 0.04752739925256835], ["admire", 0.04752739925256835], ["crystal", 0.04752739925256835], ["shore", 0.04752739925256835], ["germany", 0.04752739925256835], ["things", 0.04381960984971402], ["belong", 0.04334734659165944], ["art", 0.04334734659165944], ["machine", 0.04334734659165944], ["music", 0.04334734659165944], ["mountains", 0.04334734659165944], ["interchangeable", 0.04334734659165944], ["sane", 0.04334734659165944], ["science", 0.04334734659165944], ["sister", 0.04139109365061333], ["brother", 0.04139109365061333], ["foreign", 0.040381552030300874], ["entered", 0.040381552030300874], ["easy", 0.040381552030300874], ["interesting", 0.040381552030300874], ["delight", 0.040381552030300874], ["born", 0.040381552030300874], ["growing", 0.040381552030300874], ["years", 0.03921871188447259], ["faithful", 0.038081103047680157], ["maxinkuckee", 0.038081103047680157], ["lake", 0.038081103047680157], ["dollars", 0.038081103047680157], ["reason", 0.036201499369391966], ["sudden", 0.03461231710313157], ["parts", 0.03461231710313157], ["learn", 0.03461231710313157], ["short", 0.03461231710313157], ["lost", 0.03461231710313157], ["raised", 0.0332357048080334], ["longer", 0.0332357048080334], ["china", 0.03202144670848306], ["second", 0.029952676652172217], ["lot", 0.029055652147124487], ["indianapolis", 0.02746646988086409], ["school", 0.02746646988086409], ["country", 0.02746646988086409], ["left", 0.02675520316450377], ["servants", 0.026089857585765923], ["time", 0.022346334080061217], ["great", 0.02108462237152158], ["children", 0.020695546825306665], ["relatives", 0.018944010363498444], ["course", 0.01862677676899583], ["good", 0.018319014262298084]], "sentiment": ["There were good things to inherit, too, of course\u2014sane businesses, comfortable homes and faithful servants, growing mountains of china and crystal and silverware, reputations for honest dealing, cottages on Lake Maxinkuckee, along whose eastern shore my family once owned a village of summer homes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut the delight the family took in itself was permanently crippled, I think, by the sudden American hatred for all things German which unsheathed itself when this country entered the First World War, five years before I was born.\nChildren in our family were no longer taught German.

I have just been told that he could not come because he could not afford to leave his job! And what job does this society give its greatest prophet?\" Eliot choked up, and, for a few moments, he couldn't make himself name Trout's job. \"They have made him a stock clerk in a trading stamp redemption center in Hyannis!\"\nThis was true. Trout, the author of eighty-seven paperback books, was a very poor man, and unknown outside the science-fiction field. He was sixty-six years old when Eliot spoke so warmly of him.\n\"Ten thousand years from now,\" Eliot predicted boozily, \"the names of our generals and presidents will be forgotten, and the only hero of our time still remembered will be the author of 2BRO2B.\" This was the title of a book by Trout, a title which, upon examination, turned out to be the famous question posed by Hamlet.\nMushari dutifully went looking for a copy of the book for his dossier on Eliot. No reputable bookseller had ever heard of Trout. Mushari made his last try at a smut-dealer's hole in the wall. There, amidst the rawest pornography, he found tattered copies of every book Trout had ever written. 2BRO2B, which had been published at twenty-five cents, cost him five dollars, which was what The Kama Sutra of Vitsayana cost, too.\nMushari glanced through the Kama Sutra, the long-suppressed oriental manual on the art and techniques of love, read this:\nIf a man makes a sort of jelly with the juices of the fruit cassia fistula and eugenie jambolina and mixes the powder of the plants soma, veronia anthelminica, eclipta prostata, lohopa-juihirka, and applies this mixture to the yoni of a woman with whom he is about to have intercourse, he will instantly cease to love her.\nMushari didn't see anything funny in that. He never saw anything funny in anything, so deeply immured was he by the utterly unplayful spirit of the law.\nAnd he was witless enough, too, to imagine that Trout's books were very dirty books, since they were sold for such high prices to such queer people in such a place. He didn't understand that what Trout had in common with pornography wasn't sex but fantasies of an impossibly hospitable world.\nSo Mushari felt swindled as he wallowed through the garish prose, lusted for sex, learned instead about automation. Trout's favorite formula was to describe a perfectly hideous society, not unlike his own, and then, toward the end, to suggest ways in which it could be improved. In 2BRO2B he hypothecated an America in which almost all of the work was done by machines, and the only people who could get work had three or more Ph.D's. There was a serious overpopulation problem, too.\nAll serious diseases had been conquered. So death was voluntary, and the government, to encourage volunteers for death, set up a purple-roofed Ethical Suicide Parlor at every major intersection, right next door to an orange-roofed Howard John-son's. There were pretty hostesses in the parlor, and Barca-Loungers, and Muzak, and a choice of fourteen painless ways to die.

It insisted on being a very unfriendly story, so I quit writing it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd now, in July of 1945, Father came into Stegemeier\u2019s Restaurant, still very much alive. He was about the age that I am now, a widower with no interest in ever being married again and with no evident wish for a lover of any kind. He had a mustache like the one I have today. I was clean-shaven then.\nA terrible ordeal was ending\u2014a planetary economic collapse followed by a planetary war. Fighting men were starting to come home everywhere. You might think that Father would comment on that, however fleetingly, and on the new era that was being born. He did not.\nHe told instead, and perfectly charmingly, about an adventure he had had that morning. While driving into the city, he had seen an old house being torn down. He had stopped and taken a closer look at its skeleton. He noticed that the sill under the front door was an unusual wood, which he finally decided was poplar. I gathered that it was about eight inches square and four feet long. He admired it so much that the wreckers gave it to him. He borrowed a hammer from one of them and pulled out all the nails he could see.\nThen he took it to a sawmill\u2014to have it ripped into boards. He would decide later what to do with the boards. Mostly, he wanted to see the grain in this unusual wood. He had to promise the mill that there were no nails left in the timber. This he did. But there was still a nail in there. It had lost its head, and so was invisible. There was an earsplitting shriek from the circular saw when it hit the nail. Smoke came from the belt that was trying to spin the stalled saw.\nNow Father had to pay for a new sawblade and a new belt, too, and had been told never to come there with used lumber again. He was delighted somehow. The story was a sort of fairy tale, with a moral in it for everyone.\nUncle Alex and I had no very vivid response to the story. Like all of Father\u2019s stories, it was as neatly packaged and self-contained as an egg.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo we ordered more beers. Uncle Alex would later become a cofounder of the Indianapolis chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous, although his wife would say often and pointedly that he himself had never been an alcoholic. He began to talk now about The Columbia Conserve Company, a cannery that Powers Hapgood\u2019s father, William, also a Harvard man, had founded in Indianapolis in 1903. It was a famous experiment in industrial democracy, but I had never heard of it before.

They sank to their knees to pick over the fragments. The more durable contents of the house had been locked in rock for eons, only now to meet air and sunlight. The perishable furnishings had left their impressions.\n\u201cBooks\u2014dozens of them,\u201d said Peter, turning a fragment this way and that to count the now-familiar rectangular specks.\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s a painting.

What could this be but a stove?\u201d\n\u201cMillions of years before the first man\u2014before the first gorilla, chimp, or orangutan, or even the first monkey, Josef\u2014the ants had everything, everything.\u201d Peter stared ecstatically into the distance, shrinking in his imagination down to the size of a finger joint and living a full, rich life in a stately pleasure dome all his own.\nIt was high noon when Peter and Josef had completed a cursory examination of the rocks in box number one. In all, they found fifty-three of the houses, each different\u2014some large, some small, varying from domes to cubes, each one a work of individuality and imagination. The houses seemed to have been spaced far apart, and rarely were they occupied by more than a male and a female and young.\nJosef grinned foolishly, incredulously. \u201cPeter, are we drunk or crazy?\u201d He sat in silence, smoking a cigarette and periodically shaking his head. \u201cDo you realize it\u2019s lunchtime? It seems as though we\u2019ve been here about ten minutes.

He had been agitating a long time for permission to junk the group, without much luck. The lathes were of the old type, built originally to be controlled by men, and adapted during the war, clumsily, to the new techniques. The accuracy was going out of them, and, as the meter in Katharine\u2019s office had pointed out, rejects were showing up in quantity. Paul was willing to bet that the lathe group was ten per cent as wasteful as it had been in the days of human control and mountainous scrap heaps.\nThe group, five ranks of ten machines each, swept their tools in unison across steel bars, kicked out finished shafts onto continuous belts, stopped while raw bars dropped between their chucks and tailstocks, clamped down, and swept their tools across the bars, kicked out the finished shafts onto \u2026\nPaul unlocked the box containing the tape recording that controlled them all. The tape was a small loop that fed continuously between magnetic pickups. On it were recorded the movements of a master machinist turning out a shaft for a fractional horsepower motor. Paul counted back\u2014eleven, twelve, thirteen years ago, he\u2019d been in on the making of the tape, the master from which this one had been made\u2026.\nHe and Finnerty and Shepherd, with the ink hardly dry on their doctorates, had been sent to one of the machine shops to make the recording. The foreman had pointed out his best man\u2014what was his name?\u2014and, joking with the puzzled machinist, the three bright young men had hooked up the recording apparatus to the lathe controls. Hertz! That had been the machinist\u2019s name\u2014Rudy Hertz, an old-timer, who had been about ready to retire. Paul remembered the name now, and remembered the deference the old man had shown the bright young men.\nAfterward, they\u2019d got Rudy\u2019s foreman to let him off, and, in a boisterous, whimsical spirit of industrial democracy, they\u2019d taken him across the street for a beer. Rudy hadn\u2019t understood quite what the recording instruments were all about, but what he had understood, he\u2019d liked: that he, out of thousands of machinists, had been chosen to have his motions immortalized on tape.\nAnd here, now, this little loop in the box before Paul, here was Rudy as Rudy had been to his machine that afternoon\u2014Rudy, the turner-on of power, the setter of speeds, the controller of the cutting tool. This was the essence of Rudy as far as his machine was concerned, as far as the economy was concerned, as far as the war effort had been concerned. The tape was the essence distilled from the small, polite man with the big hands and black fingernails; from the man who thought the world could be saved if everyone read a verse from the Bible every night; from the man who adored a collie for want of children; from the man who \u2026 What else had Rudy said that afternoon? Paul supposed the old man was dead now\u2014or in his second childhood in Homestead.\nNow, by switching in lathes on a master panel and feeding them signals from the tape, Paul could make the essence of Rudy Hertz produce one, ten, a hundred, or a thousand of the shafts.\nPaul closed the box\u2019s door. The tape seemed in good condition, and so were the pickups. Everything, in fact, was as ship-shape as could be expected, considering the antiquity of the machines. There were just going to have to be rejects, and that was that. The whole group belonged in a museum, not a production setup. Even the box was archaic\u2014a vaultlike affair bolted to the floor, with a steel door and lock. At the time of the riots, right after the war, the master tapes had all been locked up in this way. Now, with the antisabotage laws as rigidly enforced as they were, the only protection the controls needed was from dust, cockroaches, and mice.\nAt the door, in the old part of the building once more, Paul paused for a moment to listen to the music of Building 58. He had had it in the back of his mind for years to get a composer to do something with it\u2014the Building 58 Suite. It was wild and Latin music, hectic rhythms, fading in and out of phase, kaleidoscopic sound. He tried to separate and identify the themes. There! The lathe groups, the tenors: \u201cFur-razz-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ak! ting! Furr-azz-ow-ow \u2026\u201d The welders, the baritones: \u201cVaaaaaaa-zuzip! Vaaaaaaa-zuzip!\u201d And, with the basement as a resonating chamber, the punch presses, the basses: \u201cAw-grumph! tonka-tonka. Aw-grump! tonka-tonka \u2026\u201d It was exciting music, and Paul, flushed, his vague anxieties gone, gave himself over to it.\nOut of the corner of his eye, a crazy, spinning movement caught his fancy, and he turned in his delight to watch a cluster of miniature maypoles braid bright cloth insulation about a black snake of cable. A thousand little dancers whirled about one another at incredible speeds, pirouetting, dodging one another, unerringly building their snug snare about the cable. Paul laughed at the wonderful machines, and had to look away to keep from getting dizzy. In the old days, when women had watched over the machines, some of the more simple-hearted had been found sitting rigidly at their posts, staring, long after quitting time.", 0.1277716057888472], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["confido", 0.1541224369503678], ["ellen", 0.10942724986017105], ["ear", 0.10642971347845236], ["halfway", 0.05455412164041856], ["deliberately", 0.05455412164041856], ["ohhhhhh", 0.05455412164041856], ["mosquito", 0.05455412164041856], ["concealed", 0.05455412164041856], ["drumming", 0.05455412164041856], ["overtone", 0.05455412164041856], ["slipped", 0.05455412164041856], ["depreciatively", 0.05455412164041856], ["hum", 0.05455412164041856], ["shushing", 0.05455412164041856], ["tissue", 0.05455412164041856], ["deserves", 0.05455412164041856], ["understands", 0.05455412164041856], ["aloud", 0.05455412164041856], ["cheerful", 0.04775856104669361], ["consciously", 0.04775856104669361], ["tinny", 0.04775856104669361], ["blouse", 0.04775856104669361], ["objected", 0.04775856104669361], ["comb", 0.04775856104669361], ["healthy", 0.04775856104669361], ["lousy", 0.04775856104669361], ["stretched", 0.04775856104669361], ["pinned", 0.04775856104669361], ["earphone", 0.04775856104669361], ["faintly", 0.04775856104669361], ["metal", 0.04775856104669361], ["cramped", 0.04775856104669361], ["nice", 0.04679346229362251], ["ambition", 0.04378341292798611], ["flat", 0.04378341292798611], ["gingerly", 0.04378341292798611], ["helplessly", 0.04378341292798611], ["wire", 0.040963000452968655], ["pleasant", 0.040963000452968655], ["surface", 0.040963000452968655], ["soft", 0.03877531857733915], ["easy", 0.03698785233426116], ["brave", 0.03698785233426116], ["filled", 0.03698785233426116], ["hurt", 0.03698785233426116], ["cleared", 0.03698785233426116], ["bring", 0.03547657115948412], ["waved", 0.03547657115948412], ["voice", 0.03535922140449277], ["throat", 0.0341674398592437], ["thought", 0.0332023411061726], ["surprise", 0.03301270421555367], ["speak", 0.03301270421555367], ["suppose", 0.03301270421555367], ["break", 0.031979757983614195], ["child", 0.031979757983614195], ["mark", 0.030192291740536205], ["poor", 0.030192291740536205], ["kid", 0.030192291740536205], ["whispered", 0.02940755931236428], ["box", 0.02940755931236428], ["morning", 0.028681010565759165], ["front", 0.028004609864906698], ["window", 0.027371879265518744], ["understand", 0.027371879265518744], ["inside", 0.027371879265518744], ["deep", 0.02677752022810272], ["hair", 0.026217143621828712], ["open", 0.026217143621828712], ["husband", 0.023813982268564158], ["good", 0.023432795193248465], ["left", 0.023396731146811255], ["paper", 0.02188544997203421], ["knew", 0.021209049271181744], ["love", 0.020887580419975956], ["henry", 0.020887580419975956], ["high", 0.020887580419975956], ["talk", 0.02057631867179379], ["help", 0.019981959634377766], ["turned", 0.01814655235900378], ["things", 0.017910301853326715], ["house", 0.017679610702246384], ["wasn", 0.0170184216748392], ["woman", 0.016200954920534777], ["head", 0.014745856831139943], ["going", 0.013628756249284864], ["time", 0.011350991765278828]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYou tell me, Henry.

He wrote in a library housing some eight hundred thousand volumes of interest to no one else. Most had never been read and probably never would be read, so there was nothing to stop him from tearing out their blank endpapers for stationery. This he did not do. Why he did not do this is not known. Whatever the reason, he wrote this book in pencil on everything from brown wrapping paper to the backs of business cards. The unconventional lines separating passages within chapters indicate where one scrap ended and the next began. The shorter the passage, the smaller the scrap.\nOne can speculate that the author, fishing through trash for anything to write on, may have hoped to establish a reputation for humility or insanity, since he was facing trial. It is equally likely, though, that he began this book impulsively, having no idea it would become a book, scribbling words on a scrap which happened to be right at hand. It could be that he found it congenial, then, to continue on from scrap to scrap, as though each were a bottle for him to fill. When he filled one up, possibly, no matter what its size, he could satisfy himself that he had written everything there was to write about this or that.\nHe numbered all the pages so there could be no doubt about their being sequential, nor about his hope that someone, undaunted by their disreputable appearance, would read them as a book. He in fact says here and there, with increasing confidence as he nears the end, that what he is doing is writing a book.\nThere are several drawings of a tombstone. The author made only one such drawing. The others are tracings of the original, probably made by superimposing translucent pieces of paper and pressing them against a sunlit library windowpane. He wrote words on the face of each burial marker, and in one case simply a question mark. These did not reproduce well on a printed page. So they have been set in type instead.\nThe author himself is responsible for the capitalization of certain words whose initial letters a meticulous editor might prefer to see in lowercase. So, too, did Eugene Debs Hartke choose for reasons unexplained to let numbers stand for themselves, except at the heads of sentences, rather than put them into words: for example, \u201c2\u201d instead of \u201dtwo.\u201d He may have felt that numbers lost much of their potency when diluted by an alphabet.\nTo virtually all of his idiosyncrasies I, after much thought, have applied what another author once told me was the most sacred word in a great editor\u2019s vocabulary. That word is \u201cstet.\u201d\nK.V.", 0.17261904761904762], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["character", 0.15001156999431306], ["teaching", 0.10000771332954203], ["creative", 0.10000771332954203], ["reader", 0.08221566028344193], ["writing", 0.07867543587967582], ["college", 0.05845303054320666], ["heller", 0.05673344094205204], ["22", 0.05673344094205204], ["4", 0.05673344094205204], ["2", 0.05673344094205204], ["reveal", 0.05673344094205204], ["3", 0.05673344094205204], ["7", 0.05673344094205204], ["101", 0.05673344094205204], ["sadist", 0.05673344094205204], ["maple", 0.05673344094205204], ["joseph", 0.05673344094205204], ["6", 0.05673344094205204], ["syrup", 0.05673344094205204], ["coughing", 0.05673344094205204], ["root", 0.05673344094205204], ["lend", 0.05673344094205204], ["city", 0.052583499050528344], ["exhaust", 0.050003856664771015], ["saab", 0.050003856664771015], ["advance", 0.050003856664771015], ["total", 0.050003856664771015], ["editor", 0.050003856664771015], ["pneumonia", 0.050003856664771015], ["5", 0.050003856664771015], ["blacked", 0.050003856664771015], ["war", 0.04742421427901367], ["hadn", 0.04678751869021773], ["parked", 0.04606730221711893], ["stranger", 0.04606730221711893], ["neighborhood", 0.04606730221711893], ["harvard", 0.04606730221711893], ["1", 0.04606730221711893], ["cleaning", 0.04606730221711893], ["characters", 0.04606730221711893], ["woods", 0.04327427238748999], ["innocent", 0.04327427238748999], ["iowa", 0.04327427238748999], ["oil", 0.04327427238748999], ["action", 0.04327427238748999], ["leading", 0.04327427238748999], ["wasted", 0.04327427238748999], ["will", 0.04232976254178084], ["sentence", 0.041107830141720966], ["ears", 0.041107830141720966], ["bottom", 0.041107830141720966], ["smoke", 0.041107830141720966], ["author", 0.041107830141720966], ["garden", 0.03933771793983791], ["hole", 0.03933771793983791], ["star", 0.03933771793983791], ["dry", 0.037841109397825694], ["tank", 0.037841109397825694], ["settled", 0.036544688110208966], ["speak", 0.034378245864439945], ["gas", 0.034378245864439945], ["indianapolis", 0.034378245864439945], ["write", 0.033452904312941636], ["happen", 0.033452904312941636], ["imagine", 0.033452904312941636], ["order", 0.033452904312941636], ["catch", 0.03260813366255688], ["awful", 0.03111152512054467], ["water", 0.03111152512054467], ["sweet", 0.03111152512054467], ["close", 0.030441691416787858], ["things", 0.03042482132068552], ["time", 0.03003961344637696], ["start", 0.028671579214904805], ["glass", 0.028671579214904805], ["person", 0.02764866158715892], ["york", 0.02717497067289259], ["story", 0.02717497067289259], ["started", 0.02717497067289259], ["black", 0.026291749525264172], ["open", 0.02548221934138989], ["window", 0.024381940843263648], ["matter", 0.023393759345108865], ["feel", 0.02167598547948675], ["couldn", 0.020679343207058755], ["business", 0.020445386395611564], ["left", 0.019353367139041757], ["love", 0.016664175067827847], ["day", 0.0163559352783659]], "sentiment": ["If you left a Saab parked for more than a day, the oil settled like maple syrup to the bottom of the gas tank. When you started it up, the exhaust would black out a whole neighborhood. One time I blacked out Woods Hole that way. I was coughing like everybody else, I couldn\u2019t imagine where all that smoke had come from.\nThen I took to teaching creative writing, first at Iowa, then at Harvard, and then at City College in New York. Joseph Heller, author of Catch-22, was teaching at City College also. He said to me that if it hadn\u2019t been for the war, he would have been in the dry-cleaning business. I said to him that if it hadn\u2019t been for the war, I would have been garden editor of The Indianapolis Star.\nNow lend me your ears. Here is Creative Writing 101:\n1. Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.\n2. Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.\n3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.\n4. Every sentence must do one of two things\u2014reveal character or advance the action.\n5.

They were bum poets as well.\nBut some of the nonsense was evil, since it concealed great crimes.
