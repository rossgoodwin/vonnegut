I haven\u2019t sold enough of our pictures during the past three years to cover the cost of frames for shows. We are not popular. My interest wanes.\nA German has turned Slaughterhouse-5 into an opera, which premieres in Munich on June 28. I have heard nothing from the composer. He apparently assumes I\u2019m dead. I was invited over, but said I had a previous engagement. Years ago, he asked my agent for permission, which was given, and that was the end of the correspondence. But the whole idea upsets me somehow. It would be a nightmare for me to be trapped in a theater, having to hear that language I barely understand, and which for me has unpleasant associations.", -0.022857142857142857], "title": "Letters"}}
