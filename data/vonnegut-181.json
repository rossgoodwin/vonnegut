There was nobody there anymore. \u201cNobody home.\u201d\nI found a mortician only one block away. I had him pick up the body and embalm it and put it into a serviceable casket. There was no funeral. I did not even accompany it to the grave, which was a crypt in a great concrete honeycomb in Morristown, New Jersey. The cemetery had advertised in the Times that morning. Each crypt had a tasteful little bronze door on which the tenant\u2019s name was engraved.\nLittle did I dream that the man who did the engraving of the doors would be arrested for drunken driving about two years later, and would comment on what an unusual name the arresting officer had. He had come across it only once before\u2014at his lugubrious place of work. The name of the officer, a Morris County deputy sheriff, actually, was Francis X. O\u2019Looney.\nO\u2019Looney would become curious as to how the woman in the crypt was related to him.\nO\u2019Looney, using the sparse documents at the cemetery, would trace Mary Kathleen back to the morgue in New York City. There he would get a set of her fingerprints. On the outside chance that she had been arrested or had spent time in a mental institution, he would send the prints to the F.B.I.\nThus would RAMJAC be brought tumbling down.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.04661386593204773], "title": "Jailbird"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["church", 0.1389176655354814], ["pulpit", 0.08271564470211659], ["redwine", 0.07859769738826292], ["wanderer", 0.07087085364978113], ["happy", 0.0694588327677407], ["weary", 0.06854147397216036], ["subtitle", 0.06854147397216036], ["prophecy", 0.06854147397216036], ["madly", 0.06854147397216036], ["suit", 0.05894827304119718], ["garment", 0.055143763134744395], ["arrive", 0.05163544517801536], ["miracle", 0.04891418235711037], ["circumstances", 0.04891418235711037], ["fit", 0.04669074873767189], ["bell", 0.04318243078094286], ["clothes", 0.041746052297328425], ["post", 0.040461167960037854], ["utterly", 0.040461167960037854], ["hung", 0.03929884869413146], ["indifferent", 0.0372616037592148], ["rooftree", 0.03427073698608018], ["forged", 0.03427073698608018], ["straggler", 0.03427073698608018], ["glove", 0.03427073698608018], ["mode", 0.03427073698608018], ["hanger", 0.03427073698608018], ["nail", 0.03427073698608018], ["coathanger", 0.03427073698608018], ["justified", 0.03427073698608018], ["emotional", 0.03427073698608018], ["lone", 0.03427073698608018], ["rugged", 0.03427073698608018], ["rubberized", 0.03427073698608018], ["spike", 0.03427073698608018], ["rainy", 0.03427073698608018], ["semiprecious", 0.03427073698608018], ["adverse", 0.03427073698608018], ["reunited", 0.03427073698608018], ["parishioners", 0.030044229787543935], ["encrusted", 0.030044229787543935], ["zipper", 0.030044229787543935], ["afternoon", 0.030044229787543935], ["signified", 0.030044229787543935], ["glamour", 0.030044229787543935], ["minister", 0.030044229787543935], ["ideally", 0.030044229787543935], ["oak", 0.030044229787543935], ["space", 0.028046356705022372], ["transparent", 0.027571881567372197], ["rung", 0.027571881567372197], ["churches", 0.027571881567372197], ["stitched", 0.027571881567372197], ["ring", 0.027571881567372197], ["ecstasy", 0.027571881567372197], ["marks", 0.02581772258900768], ["beam", 0.02581772258900768], ["barnstable", 0.02581772258900768], ["creation", 0.02581772258900768], ["laugh", 0.02581772258900768], ["design", 0.02581772258900768], ["weep", 0.02581772258900768], ["mechanical", 0.02581772258900768], ["day", 0.024840023503183418], ["drop", 0.024457091178555185], ["extraordinarily", 0.024457091178555185], ["horner", 0.024457091178555185], ["lemon", 0.024457091178555185], ["driven", 0.024457091178555185], ["coat", 0.024457091178555185], ["add", 0.023345374368835946], ["bag", 0.023345374368835946], ["delivered", 0.023345374368835946], ["reverend", 0.023345374368835946], ["miracles", 0.023345374368835946], ["tuesday", 0.023345374368835946], ["plastic", 0.023345374368835946], ["tight", 0.023345374368835946], ["stones", 0.02240543119915754], ["mighty", 0.02240543119915754], ["special", 0.02240543119915754], ["promised", 0.02159121539047143], ["ready", 0.02159121539047143], ["skin", 0.020873026148664212], ["religion", 0.020873026148664212], ["wished", 0.020873026148664212], ["naked", 0.020873026148664212], ["god", 0.020833876344987852], ["orange", 0.020230583980018927], ["signal", 0.020230583980018927], ["front", 0.01964942434706573], ["loved", 0.019118867170299692], ["foot", 0.018178924000621287], ["climbed", 0.018178924000621287], ["feel", 0.017758235759847196], ["question", 0.016995045863786182], ["stevenson", 0.01664651895012796], ["mate", 0.01664651895012796], ["carried", 0.01664651895012796], ["simply", 0.01664651895012796], ["closed", 0.015706575780449556], ["yellow", 0.015422917148529478], ["stony", 0.015422917148529478], ["iron", 0.01515186981578049], ["bee", 0.014643445371030177], ["high", 0.014404294681071145], ["stood", 0.013952416802085036], ["army", 0.013738445339821196], ["friend", 0.013738445339821196], ["piece", 0.013531728561310944], ["best", 0.012950568928357744], ["order", 0.012252944835810523], ["son", 0.011777569582946425], ["hand", 0.011480068581913304], ["niles", 0.010540125412234898], ["winston", 0.009617985352942681], ["head", 0.00900772036174157], ["chrono", 0.008365278193096286], ["going", 0.007863826374578164], ["mars", 0.007705439262363161], ["man", 0.006313618213698647], ["rumfoord", 0.004590648873546144]], "sentiment": ["All that kept him going was a wish that was more mechanical than emotional. He wished to be reunited with Bee, his mate, with Chrono, his son, and with Stony Stevenson, his best and only friend.\nThe Reverend C. Horner Redwine stood in the pulpit of his church that rainy Tuesday afternoon. There was no one else in the church. Redwine had climbed up to the pulpit in order simply to be as happy as possible. He was not being as happy as possible under adverse circumstances. He was being as happy as possible under extraordinarily happy circumstances\u2014for he was a much loved minister of a religion that not only promised but delivered miracles.\nHis church, the Barnstable First Church of God the Utterly Indifferent, had a subtitle: The Church of the Weary Space Wanderer. The subtitle was justified by this prophecy: That a lone straggler from the Army of Mars would arrive at Redwine\u2019s church some day.\nThe church was ready for the miracle. There was a hand-forged iron spike driven into the rugged oak post behind the pulpit. The post carried the mighty beam that was the rooftree. And on the nail was hung a coat-hanger encrusted with semiprecious stones. And on the coathanger hung a suit of clothes in a transparent plastic bag.\nThe prophecy was that the weary Space Wanderer would be naked, that the suit of clothes would fit him like a glove. The suit was of such a design as to fit no one but the right man well.

It was of unaccompanied piano by Meade Lux Lewis.\nSince Angela, in order to deepen her trance, let Lewis play his first number without joining him, I read some of what the jacket said about Lewis.\n\u201cBorn in Louisville, Ky., in 1905,\u201d I read, \u201cMr. Lewis didn\u2019t turn to music until he had passed his 16th birthday and then the instrument provided by his father was the violin. A year later young Lewis chanced to hear Jimmy Yancey play the piano. \u2018This,\u2019 as Lewis recalls, \u2018was the real thing.\u2019 Soon,\u201d I read, \u2019Lewis was teaching himself to play the boogie-woogie piano, absorbing all that was possible from the older Yancey, who remained until his death a close friend and idol to Mr. Lewis. Since his father was a Pullman porter,\u201d I read, \u201cthe Lewis family lived near the railroad. The rhythm of the trains soon became a natural pattern to young Lewis and he composed the boogie-woogie solo, now a classic of its kind, which became known as \u2018Honky Tonk Train Blues.\u2019\u201d\nI looked up from my reading. The first number on the record was done. The phonograph needle was now scratching its slow way across the void to the second. The second number, I learned from the jacket, was \u201cDragon Blues.\u201d\nMeade Lux Lewis played four bars alone\u2014and then Angela Hoenikker joined in.\nHer eyes were closed.\nI was flabbergasted.\nShe was great.\nShe improvised around the music of the Pullman porter\u2019s son; went from liquid lyricism to rasping lechery to the shrill skittishness of a frightened child, to a

And he felt evil and damned as he looked at Wanda, good, good soul, who\u2019d never done anything to offend him, whose love for him was as big as all outdoors. He fingered the three ten-dollar bills in his pocket, his take-home pay\u2014cigarette money, recreation money, small luxury money the machines let him have. This tiny atom of the economy under his control he was going to spend, not on himself or Wanda or the kids, but on Marion. Edgar\u2019s troubled heart had gone out to the crazy man in Halyard\u2019s story, the guy who\u2019d bought himself an electric organ.

She\u2019s very beautiful and charming. And I\u2019m not exactly a girl any more, and I expect I\u2019m pretty dull.\u201d She started to cry, and, good soul that she was, she tried to keep him from seeing it. She hurried into the kitchen, took four suppers from the deep freeze, and thrust them into the radar range. \u201cCall the children, will you please, Edgar?\u201d she said in a small, high voice. \u201cSupper will be ready in twenty-eight seconds.\u201d\nEdgar shouted the children\u2019s names into the twilight, and returned to Wanda. \u201cListen, Wan\u2014it isn\u2019t you. The Lord knows it isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d He hugged her from behind, and she twisted away and pretended to adjust dials on the range, though there was no adjusting to be done. Clockwork was doing everything.\nChimes rang, the clockwork clicked, and the range\u2019s humming stopped. \u201cCall the children before everything gets cold,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d Edgar tried to hug her again, and she let him this time. \u201cListen,\u201d he said passionately, \u201cit\u2019s the world, Wan\u2014me and the world. I\u2019m no good to anybody, not in this world.

My mother got fat, and my grandmother got fat, and guess it\u2019s in the blood; but somebody needed them, they were still some good.

He had to use his uninjured left hand.\nEPILOGUE\nTHE EMERGENCY ROOM of the hospital was in the basement. After Kilgore Trout had the stump of his ring finger disinfected and trimmed and bandaged, he was told to go upstairs to the finance office. There were certain forms he had to fill out, since he was from outside Midland County, had no health insurance, and was destitute. He had no checkbook. He had no cash.\nHe got lost in the basement for a little while, as a lot of people did. He found the double doors to the morgue, as a lot of people did. He automatically mooned about his own mortality, as a lot of people did. He found an x-ray room, which wasn\u2019t in use. It made him wonder automatically if anything bad was growing inside himself. Other people had wondered exactly the same thing when they passed that room.\nTrout felt nothing now that millions of other people wouldn\u2019t have felt\u2014automatically.\nAnd Trout found stairs, but they were the wrong stairs. They led him not to the lobby and the finance office and the gift shop and all that, but into a matrix of rooms where persons were recovering or failing to recover from injuries of all kinds. Many of the people there had been flung to the earth by the force of gravity, which never relaxed for a second.\nTrout passed a very expensive private room now, and there was a young black man in there, with a white telephone and a color television set and boxes of candy and bouquets of flowers all around. He was Elgin Washington, a pimp who operated out of the old Holiday Inn. He was only twenty-six years old, but he was fabulously well-to-do.\nVisiting hours had ended, so all his female sex slaves had departed. But they had left clouds of perfume behind. Trout gagged as he passed the door. It was an automatic reaction to the fundamentally unfriendly cloud. Elgin Washington had just sniffed cocaine into his sinus passages, which amplified tremendously the telepathic messages he sent and received. He felt one hundred times bigger than life, because the messages were so loud and exciting. It was their noise that thrilled him. He didn\u2019t care what they said.\nAnd, in the midst of the uproar, Elgin Washington said something wheedlingly to Trout. \u201cHey man, hey man, hey man,\u201d he wheedled. He had had his foot amputated earlier in the day by Khashdrahr Miasma, but he had forgotten that. \u201cHey man, hey man,\u201d he coaxed. He wanted nothing particular from Trout. Some part of his mind was idly exercising his skill at making strangers come to him. He was a fisherman for men\u2019s souls. \u201cHey man\u2014\u201d he said. He showed a gold tooth.

This was in the German village of Karlswald, in the American Zone of Occupation. Had the children not been kept there, not been given the warmth and food and clothes that could be begged for them, they might have wandered off the edges of the earth, searching for parents who had long ago stopped searching for them.\nEvery mild afternoon the nuns marched the children, two by two, through the woods, into the village and back, for their ration of fresh air.

That night, undetected, the paratroops took up positions behind Musket Mountain. Two hours before the next dawn, they came quietly around either side of the mountain, captured the stable, freed the hostages, and then took possession of all of Scipio. They had to kill only 1 person, who was the guard dozing outside the stable. They strangled him with a standard piece of equipment. I had used one just like it in Vietnam. It was a meter of piano wire with a wooden handle at either end.\nSo that was that.\nThe defenders were out of ammunition. There were hardly any defenders left anyway. Maybe 10.\nAGAIN, I DON\u2019T believe there would have been such delicate microsurgery by the best ground troops available, if it hadn\u2019t been for the social prominence of the Trustees.\nThey were helicoptered to Rochester, where they were shown on TV. They thanked God and the Army. They said they had never lost hope. They said they were tired but happy, and just wanted to get a hot bath and then sleep in a nice clean bed.\nALL NATIONAL GUARDSMEN who had been south of the Meadowdale Cinema Complex during the siege got Combat Infantryman\u2019s Badges. They were so pleased.\nThe paratroops already had theirs. When they dressed up for the victory parade, they wore campaign ribbons from Costa Rica and Bimini and El Paso and on and on, and from the Battle of the South Bronx, of course.

After nightfall, the flash area becomes a free-fire zone. Soldiers are under orders to shoot anything that moves, and their weapons are equipped with infrared sights. They can see in the dark.\nAnd in the daytime, the only permissible form of transportation for a civilian inside is a bright purple school bus, driven by a soldier, and with other soldiers aboard as stern and watchful guides. Nobody gets to bring his own car inside or to walk where he likes, even if he has lost his business and all his relatives and everything. It is all government property now. It belongs to all the people, instead of just some of them.\nWe were a party of four\u2014Felix and myself and Bernard Ketchum, our lawyer, and Hippolyte Paul De Mille, the headwaiter from the Oloffson. Ketchum\u2019s wife and Felix\u2019s wife had declined to come along. They were afraid of radioactivity, and Felix\u2019s wife was especially afraid of it, since she was with child. We were unable to persuade those superstitious souls that the whole beauty of a neutron bomb explosion was that there was no lingering radiation afterwards.\nFelix and I had run into the same sort of ignorance when it was time to bury Mother next to Father in Calvary Cemetery. People refused to believe that she herself wasn\u2019t radioactive. They were sure that she would make all the other bodies glow in the dark, and that she would seep into the water supply and so on.\nFor Mother to be personally radioactive, she would have had to bite a piece out of the mantelpiece, and then fail to excrete it. If she had done that, it\u2019s true, she would have been a holy terror for twenty thousand years or more.\nBut she didn\u2019t.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe brought old Hippolyte Paul De Mille along, who had never been outside Haiti before, on the pretext that he was the brother of a Haitian cook for Dr. Alan Maritimo, the veterinarian, and his wife. Alan was a maverick in the Maritimo family, who had declined to go into the building business. His entire household was killed by the flash. Ketchum had put together fake affidavits which entitled Hippolyte Paul to pass through the gate in a purple school bus with the rest of us.\nWe went to this trouble for Hippolyte Paul because he was our most valuable employee. Without him and his goodwill, the Grand Hotel Oloffson would have been a worthless husk. It was worth our while to keep him happy.\nBut Hippolyte Paul, in his excitement about the trip, had volunteered to make us a highly specific gift, which we intended to refuse politely at the proper time. He said that if there was any ghost we thought should haunt Midland City for the next few hundred years, he would raise it from its grave and turn it loose, to wander where it would.", 0.0035164835164835056], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["title", 0.22726384395462157], ["song", 0.2024392912995021], ["baby", 0.18916165718634295], ["lyric", 0.1474353770132526], ["moment", 0.11363192197731078], ["stray", 0.08438149128447162], ["steady", 0.08438149128447162], ["apt", 0.08438149128447162], ["panorama", 0.08438149128447162], ["reptiles", 0.08438149128447162], ["reading", 0.08438149128447162], ["announced", 0.08438149128447162], ["confused", 0.08438149128447162], ["center", 0.08438149128447162], ["recall", 0.08438149128447162], ["amused", 0.08438149128447162], ["copyof", 0.08438149128447162], ["create", 0.0737176885066263], ["braun", 0.0737176885066263], ["fixed", 0.0737176885066263], ["rule", 0.06747976376650071], ["total", 0.06747976376650071], ["master", 0.06747976376650071], ["dat", 0.06747976376650071], ["swamp", 0.06747976376650071], ["remembering", 0.06305388572878098], ["request", 0.06305388572878098], ["portrait", 0.06305388572878098], ["von", 0.05962090801625469], ["spread", 0.05962090801625469], ["break", 0.05962090801625469], ["kraft", 0.05683725457736213], ["upstairs", 0.05681596098865539], ["age", 0.05681596098865539], ["documentation", 0.05681596098865539], ["miracle", 0.05681596098865539], ["playing", 0.05444441206823603], ["golden", 0.05239008295093568], ["criminals", 0.05239008295093568], ["haifa", 0.05239008295093568], ["institute", 0.05239008295093568], ["cover", 0.05239008295093568], ["radio", 0.05057803624852978], ["mind", 0.048957105238409376], ["werner", 0.0474907947798813], ["heart", 0.0474907947798813], ["magazine", 0.0474907947798813], ["open", 0.043780609290390717], ["russian", 0.043780609290390717], ["spy", 0.042719180498283764], ["small", 0.042719180498283764], ["write", 0.03829330246056406], ["life", 0.02762949968271875], ["jones", 0.02616318922419068], ["war", 0.019020026022173783]], "sentiment": ["Jones had gone upstairs to write, to create.\nKraft, the Russian Master Spy, was reading a copyof Life that had a portrait of Werner von Braun on the cover.
