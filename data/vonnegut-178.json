Dwayne had just spit Kilgore Trout\u2019s fingertip into Sugar Creek. Don and Dwayne knew each other quite well, since Dwayne had once sold Breedlove a new Pontiac Ventura, which Don said was a lemon. A lemon was an automobile which didn\u2019t run right, and which nobody was able to repair.\nDwayne actually lost money on the transaction, making adjustments and replacing parts in an attempt to mollify Breedlove. But Breedlove was inconsolable, and he finally painted this sign in bright yellow on his trunk lid and on both doors:\nHere was what was really wrong with the car, incidentally. The child of a neighbor of Breedlove had put maple sugar in the gas tank of the Ventura. Maple sugar was a kind of candy made from the blood of trees.\nSo Dwayne Hoover now extended his right hand to Breedlove, and Breedlove without thinking anything about it took that hand in his own. They linked up like this:\nThis was a symbol of friendship between men. The feeling was, too, that a lot of character could be read into the way a man shook hands. Dwayne and Don Breedlove gave each other squeezes which were dry and hard.\nSo Dwayne held on to Don Breedlove with his right hand, and he smiled as though bygones were bygones. Then he made a cup out of his left hand, and he hit Don on the ear with the open end of the cup. This created terrific air pressure in Don\u2019s ear. He fell down because the pain was so awful. Don would never hear anything with that ear, ever again.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo Don was in the ambulance, too, now\u2014sitting up like Kilgore Trout. Francine was lying down\u2014unconscious but moaning. Beatrice Keedsler was lying down, although she might have sat up. Her jaw was broken. Bunny Hoover was lying down. His face was unrecognizable, even as a face\u2014anybody\u2019s face. He had been given morphine by Cyprian Ukwende.\nThere were five other victims as well\u2014one white female, two white males, two black males. The three white people had never been in Midland City before. They were on their way together from Erie, Pennsylvania, to the Grand Canyon, which was the deepest crack on the planet. They wanted to look down into the crack, but they never got to do it. Dwayne Hoover assaulted them as they walked from the car toward the lobby of the New Holiday Inn.\nThe two black males were both kitchen employees of the Inn.", 0.036242736242736245], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["commodore", 0.2138034511755178], ["robert", 0.16974104621582767], ["lady", 0.12437046706883907], ["supper", 0.10882558407063288], ["sad", 0.10511637871995169], ["pluck", 0.09574970361181762], ["beautiful", 0.06840093872044282], ["politics", 0.06789641848633106], ["played", 0.06594529782600095], ["girl", 0.05840086277512596], ["uh", 0.057241526914042884], ["lovers", 0.05429288125553793], ["speeches", 0.05429288125553793], ["traffic", 0.04787485180590881], ["sail", 0.04787485180590881], ["petered", 0.04787485180590881], ["tourist", 0.04787485180590881], ["guitar", 0.04787485180590881], ["desirable", 0.04412054524935174], ["brandy", 0.04412054524935174], ["moonlight", 0.04412054524935174], ["peculiar", 0.04412054524935174], ["hikers", 0.04412054524935174], ["string", 0.04145682235627969], ["asleep", 0.04145682235627969], ["lawn", 0.04145682235627969], ["choked", 0.04145682235627969], ["entirely", 0.04145682235627969], ["intelligent", 0.0393906783626296], ["relaxed", 0.0393906783626296], ["ate", 0.0393906783626296], ["time", 0.03864257814789111], ["clarice", 0.03770251579972261], ["strange", 0.03770251579972261], ["completely", 0.03770251579972261], ["cottage", 0.03770251579972261], ["veranda", 0.03770251579972261], ["things", 0.03437588871047456], ["rumfoord", 0.03394820924316553], ["warm", 0.03394820924316553], ["broke", 0.03394820924316553], ["looked", 0.03386778545713123], ["sun", 0.032972648913000474], ["mile", 0.032090147248145615], ["empty", 0.032090147248145615], ["silly", 0.032090147248145615], ["clean", 0.032090147248145615], ["sweet", 0.03128448635009349], ["slowly", 0.03128448635009349], ["lines", 0.03128448635009349], ["quiet", 0.03128448635009349], ["subject", 0.029857165240581834], ["afternoon", 0.029857165240581834], ["country", 0.029218342356443397], ["silence", 0.02753017979353641], ["heart", 0.02702955737436719], ["sort", 0.026554619463371353], ["sound", 0.026554619463371353], ["water", 0.02567211779851649], ["understand", 0.02567211779851649], ["making", 0.02412532071830199], ["brought", 0.02377587323697933], ["happy", 0.02377587323697933], ["fifty", 0.023439135790952713], ["rest", 0.02311421616307058], ["minute", 0.022496703436231027], ["side", 0.021917811241959417], ["sir", 0.019684829234395636], ["god", 0.019466954258375323], ["love", 0.018643366424889243], ["face", 0.018448427450835244], ["young", 0.017887088359942325], ["night", 0.01753091909301829], ["years", 0.01622923436504431], ["asked", 0.01593052267783856], ["left", 0.015360542187103064], ["boy", 0.01444042668883266], ["will", 0.013603537230793132]], "sentiment": ["Supper that night in the Rumfoord cottage was sad and beautiful and happy and strange.

That was why supper was so peculiar. The girl was so desirable, and the love between her and Robert was so sweet and clean, that nobody could think of anything but silly little things to say.

The sad part was how empty and quiet it left the Commodore.\nThe two lovers went for a moonlight sail. The Commodore and his lady and I had brandy on the veranda, on the water side. The sun was down. The tourist traffic had petered out. The fifty-mile hikers who had asked to rest on the lawn that afternoon were still all there, sound asleep, except for one boy who played a guitar.

Years ago, I might have found out through the Freedom of Information Act. But the Supreme Court closed that peephole.\nDARWIN AND HIS troops knew the lives of the hostages were valued highly by the Government. They didn\u2019t know why, and I am not sure that I do, either. I think that the number of people with money and power had shrunk to the point where it felt like a family. For all the escaped convicts knew about them, they might as well have been aardvarks, or some other improbable animal they had never seen before.\nDarwin regretted that I, too, was going to have to stay in Scipio. He couldn\u2019t let me go, he said, because I knew too much about his defenses. There were none as far as I could see, but he sounded as though there were trenches and tank traps and mine fields all around us.\nEven more hallucinatory was his vision of the future. He was going to restore this valley to its former economic vitality. It would become an all-Black Utopia. All Whites would be resettled elsewhere.\nHe was going to put glass back into the windows of the factories, and make their roofs weather-tight again. He would get the money to do this and so many other wonderful things by selling the precious hardwoods of the National Forest to the Japanese.\nTHAT MUCH OF his dream is actually coming true now. The National Forest is now being logged by Mexican laborers using Japanese tools, under the direction of Swedes. The proceeds are expected to pay half of day-before-yesterday\u2019s interest on the National Debt.\nThat last is a joke of mine. I have no idea if any money for the forest will go toward the National Debt, which, the last I heard, was greater than the value of all property in the Western Hemisphere, thanks to compound interest.\nALTON DARWIN LOOKED me up and down, and then he said with typical sociopathic impulsiveness, \u201cProfessor, I can\u2019t let you go because I need you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d I said.

He was in the Korean War. When that was over, he decided to become a minister, too.\nHe was an innocent. He wanted to help people in trouble. So he went to the University of Chicago. He didn\u2019t study just theology. He studied sociology and psychology and anthropology, too. He went to school the year around, and, during one summer session, there was a course offered in criminology.\nGeorge didn\u2019t know anything about criminals, so he took it.\nAnd he was told to go to the county jail to interview a prisoner named Gloria St. Pierre Gratz. She was the wife of Bernard Gratz, who was said to be a killer for hire and a thief. Ironically, Gratz remained at large and unhunted, since nothing could be proved against him. His wife was in jail for possessing stolen goods, goods almost certainly stolen by him. She had not implicated him\u2014neither had she given a reasonable account of where else the diamonds and fur coats might have come from. She was serving a year and a day. Her sentence was just about up when George went to see her. George was interviewing her not simply because of her criminality, but because she had an astoundingly high I.Q. She told George that she preferred to be addressed by her maiden name, the name she had used during her days as an exotic dancer. \u201cI never learned how to answer to the name of Mrs. Gratz,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing against Bernie,\u201d she said. \u201cI just never learned.\u201d So George called her Miss St. Pierre.\nHe talked to Miss St. Pierre through a screen at the jail. It was the first jail George had ever been in. He had written down the bare bones of her biography in a loose-leaf notebook. Now he was double-checking the information.", 0.15325113378684807], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}}
