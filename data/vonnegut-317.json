I am thinking of adult audiences, of course. There are few opportunities in the tale for comedy or any universal truths beyond pure terror.\nSo I suggest this updated story line:\nThere is this backwoods, fundamentalist village run by a Jerry Falwell and vigilantes under his direction. The community is particularly obsessed by protecting the virtue of a great beauty, who was orphaned and raised by her grandmother. They have overdone this, since, when the show begins, she is a blowsy, song-belting twenty-eight, and ten men, all from out of town, have been killed by the vigilantes so far\u2014for making indecent approaches, which she has virtuously reported to Falwell. Actually, the community treasures her as bait for a very cruel trap for foreigners.\nSo yet another foreigner shows up, the wolf, a girl-crazy but innocent sort of young Rockefeller, who has come to town to investigate his roots. His ancestors founded the town.\nSo everybody in town, pretending to love young lovers and so on, heads him in the direction of the trap. The not-so-young beauty does all she can to help, hoping against hope, in her genuine innocence, that he will not be another one of those monsters who wants to defile her sacred body. A fine aria for her might be \u201cI am not meat.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the premise. How it all ends is subject to negotiation. As I said yesterday, in that premise are all sorts of song opportunities: the vigilantes extolling small-town life, with its hatred for outsiders and non-conformists, the wolf\u2019s singing that it is natural and good that he can\u2019t keep his hands off beautiful girls, the wolf\u2019s celebration of discovering his roots, and so on.\nYours truly,\nKurt Vonnegut\nFebruary 16, 1985", 0.13657142857142857], "title": "Letters"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["painter", 0.13440118165434645], ["hostess", 0.11839993647060723], ["fit", 0.10246551852670044], ["demanding", 0.10246551852670044], ["planet", 0.09314448155869666], ["born", 0.07921032515478135], ["fruitful", 0.06716717720725701], ["cancellation", 0.06716717720725701], ["deepest", 0.06716717720725701], ["mournful", 0.06716717720725701], ["paintbrush", 0.06716717720725701], ["appointment", 0.06716717720725701], ["intending", 0.06716717720725701], ["ladder", 0.06716717720725701], ["multiply", 0.06716717720725701], ["spelling", 0.06716717720725701], ["grimmer", 0.06716717720725701], ["starvation", 0.06716717720725701], ["reflectively", 0.06716717720725701], ["puzzle", 0.059199968235303616], ["dropcloths", 0.059199968235303616], ["stepladder", 0.059199968235303616], ["pondered", 0.059199968235303616], ["grim", 0.059199968235303616], ["plague", 0.059199968235303616], ["happy", 0.054662264694980076], ["nerve", 0.054539449751301726], ["earlier", 0.054539449751301726], ["hooligan", 0.054539449751301726], ["surely", 0.054539449751301726], ["answers", 0.054539449751301726], ["booth", 0.054539449751301726], ["thought", 0.054512570344484285], ["termination", 0.05123275926335022], ["future", 0.05123275926335022], ["catbox", 0.05123275926335022], ["sir", 0.048964881616713835], ["bureau", 0.04866789085743976], ["carefully", 0.04866789085743976], ["2br02b", 0.04866789085743976], ["paint", 0.04866789085743976], ["federal", 0.04657224077934833], ["pistol", 0.04657224077934833], ["garden", 0.04657224077934833], ["dialed", 0.04657224077934833], ["warm", 0.04657224077934833], ["generations", 0.04657224077934833], ["scene", 0.044800393884782144], ["wehling", 0.044800393884782144], ["fall", 0.04326555029139683], ["slowly", 0.04191172229534644], ["decided", 0.039605162577390676], ["corner", 0.039605162577390676], ["shoot", 0.039605162577390676], ["late", 0.038605031807394934], ["remembered", 0.038605031807394934], ["forever", 0.03768500068471061], ["life", 0.03699857269963449], ["speaking", 0.03683318491282875], ["top", 0.03604016340148448], ["number", 0.035298341319443434], ["afternoon", 0.035298341319443434], ["live", 0.0333230510099416], ["telephone", 0.03273347291353298], ["easy", 0.03217266642882686], ["city", 0.03112701380577253], ["country", 0.029717791712757215], ["war", 0.028072954429531085], ["knew", 0.026301107534964892], ["voice", 0.025355842037988206], ["sat", 0.025057273228755325], ["small", 0.02476626394157958], ["long", 0.022433610562307277], ["asked", 0.02089876696892196], ["room", 0.01936392337553664]], "sentiment": ["The painter sat on the top of his stepladder, looking down reflectively on the sorry scene.

I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t get much done for the Government people. I just sat there at the keyboard\u2014weary and ill at ease, all right\u2014trying to think of something poetic, not coming up with anything that didn\u2019t belong in The Journal of the American Physical Society.\nI fiddled with EPICAC\u2019s dials, getting him ready for another problem. My heart wasn\u2019t in it, and I only set about half of them, leaving the rest the way they\u2019d been for the problem before. That way, his circuits were connected up in a random, apparently senseless fashion. For the plain hell of it, I punched out a message on the keys, using a childish numbers-for-letters code: \"1\" for \"A,\" \"2\" for \"B,\" and so on, up to \"26\" for \"Z,\" \"23-8-1-20-3-1-14-9-4-15,\" I typed\u2014\"What can I do?\"\nClickety-click, and out popped two inches of paper ribbon. I glanced at the nonsense answer to a nonsense problem: \"23-8-1-20-19-20-8-5-20-18-15-21-2-12-5.\" The odds against it being by chance a sensible message, against its even containing a meaningful word of more than three letters, were staggering. Apathetically, I decoded it. There it was, staring up at me: \"What\u2019s the trouble?\"\nI laughed out loud at the absurd coincidence. Playfully, I typed, \"My girl doesn\u2019t love me.\"\nClickety-click. \"What\u2019s love? What\u2019s girl?\" asked EPICAC.\nFlabbergasted, I noted the dial settings on his control panel, then lugged a Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary over to the keyboard. With a precision instrument like EPICAC, half-baked definitions wouldn\u2019t do. I told him about love and girl, and about how I wasn\u2019t getting any of either because I wasn\u2019t poetic. That got us onto the subject of poetry, which I defined for him.\n\"Is this poetry?\" he asked. He began clicking away like a stenographer smoking hashish. The sluggishness and stammering clicks were gone. EPICAC had found himself. The spool of paper ribbon was unwinding at an alarming rate, feeding out coils onto the floor. I asked him to stop, but EPICAC went right on creating. I finally threw the main switch to keep him from burning out.\nI stayed there until dawn, decoding. When the sun peeped over the horizon at the Wyandotte campus, I had transposed into my own writing and signed my name to a two-hundred-and-eighty-line poem entitled, simply, \"To Pat.\" I am no judge of such things, but I gather that it was terrific. It began, I remember, \"Where willow wands bless rill-crossed hollow, there, thee, Pat, dear, will I follow....\" I folded the manuscript and tucked it under one corner of the blotter on Pat\u2019s desk. I reset the dials on EPICAC for a rocket trajectory problem, and went home with a full heart and a very remarkable secret indeed.\nPat was crying over the poem when I came to work the next evening. \"It\u2019s soooo beautiful,\" was all she could say. She was meek and quiet while we worked. Just before midnight, I kissed her for the first time\u2014in the cubbyhole between the capacitors and EPICAC\u2019s tape-recorder memory.\nI was wildly happy at quitting time, bursting to talk to someone about the magnificent turn of events. Pat played coy and refused to let me take her home. I set EPICAC\u2019s dials as they had been the night before, defined kiss, and told him what the first one had felt like. He was fascinated, pressing for more details. That night, he wrote \"The Kiss.\" It wasn\u2019t an epic this time, but a simple, immaculate sonnet: \"Love is a hawk with velvet claws; Love is a rock with heart and veins; Love is a lion with satin jaws; Love is a storm with silken reins....\"", 0.170764652014652], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
