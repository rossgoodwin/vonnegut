He owned a lot of books, though, and kept buying new ones, and giving me those he thought were particularly well done. It was an ordeal for him to find this book or that one, so he could read some particularly magical passage aloud to me. Here\u2019s why: His wife Aunt Raye, who was said to be artistic, arranged his library according to the size and color of the volumes, and stairstep style.\nSo he might say of a collection of essays by his hero H. L. Mencken, \u201cI think it was green, and about this high.\u201d\nHis sister, my aunt Irma, said to me one time when I was a grownup, \u201cAll Vonnegut men are scared to death of women.\u201d Her two brothers were sure as heck scared of her.\nListen: A Harvard education for my Uncle Alex wasn\u2019t the trophy of a micromanaged Darwinian victory over others that it is today. His father, the architect Bernard Vonnegut, sent him there in order that he might become civilized, which he did indeed become, although fabulously henpecked, and nothing more than a life insurance salesman.\nI am eternally grateful to him, and indirectly to what Harvard used to be, I suppose, for my knack of finding in great books, some of them very funny books, reason enough to feel honored to be alive, no matter what else may be going on.\nIt now appears that books in the form so beloved by Uncle Alex and me, hinged and unlocked boxes, packed with leaves speckled by ink, are obsolescent. My grandchildren are already doing much of their reading from words projected on the face of a video screen.\nPlease, please, please wait just a minute!\nAt the time of their invention, books were devices as crassly practical for storing or transmitting language, albeit fabricated from scarcely modified substances found in forest and field and animals, as the latest Silicon Valley miracles.

It was plainly a cigar smoked in anger. Even the moths had sense enough to stay away. Like a restless, searching red eye, it went up and down every street in the village, coming to rest at last, a wet, dead butt, before the firehouse.\nBearse Hinkley, the old pharmacist, sat at the wheel of the pumper, his eyes glazed with nostalgia\u2014nostalgia for the days when he had been young enough to drive. And on his face, for all to see, was a dream of one more catastrophe, with all the young men away, when an old man or nobody would drive the pumper to glory one more time. He spent warm evenings there, behind the wheel\u2014and had for years.\n\"Want a light for that thing?\" he said to Corporal Fuller, seeing the dead cigar between Fuller\u2019s lips.\n\"No, thanks, Mr. Hinkley,\" he said. \"All the pleasure\u2019s out of it.\"\n\"Beats me how anybody finds any pleasure in cigars in the first place,\" said the old man.\n\"Matter of taste,\" said Fuller. \"No accounting for tastes.\"\n\"One man\u2019s meat\u2019s another man\u2019s poison,\" said Hinkley. \"Live and let live, I always say.\" He glanced at the ceiling. Above it was the fragrant nest of Susanna and her black cat. \"Me? All my pleasures are looking at what used to be pleasures.\"\nFuller looked at the ceiling, too, meeting the unmentioned issue squarely. \"If you were young,\" he said, \"you\u2019d know why I said what I said to her.

Billy wondered what the joke was.\n\u201cYou lads are leaving this afternoon for Dresden\u2014a beautiful city, I\u2019m told. You won\u2019t be cooped up like us. You\u2019ll be out where the life is, and the food is certain to be more plentiful than here. If I may inject a personal note: It has been five years now since I have seen a tree or flower or woman or child\u2014or a dog or a cat or a place of entertainment, or a human being doing useful work of any kind.\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about bombs, by the way. Dresden is an open city. It is undefended, and contains no war industries or troop concentrations of any importance.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSomewhere in there, old Edgar Derby was elected head American. The Englishman called for nominations from the floor, and there weren\u2019t any. So he nominated Derby, praising him for his maturity and long experience in dealing with people. There were no further nominations, so the nominations were closed.\n\u201cAll in favor?\u201d\nTwo or three people said, \u201cAye.\u201d\nThen poor old Derby made a speech. He thanked the Englishman for his good advice, said he meant to follow it exactly. He said he was sure that all the other Americans would do the same. He said that his primary responsibility now was to make damn well sure that everybody got home safely.\n\u201cGo take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut,\u201d murmured Paul Lazzaro in his azure nest. \u201cGo take a flying fuck at the moon.\u201d\nThe temperature climbed startlingly that day. The noontime was balmy. The Germans brought soup and bread in two-wheeled carts which were pulled by Russians.

"sentiment": ["History: (26.) Everybody on Mars came from Earth. They thought they would be better off on Mars. Nobody can remember what was so bad about Earth.\nAstronomy: (11.) Everything in the whole sky revolves around Mars once a day.\nBiology: (58.) New people come out of women when men and women sleep together. New people hardly ever come out of women on Mars because the men and the women sleep in different places.\nTheology: (15.) Somebody made everything for some reason.\nGeography: (16.) Mars is round. The only city on it is called Phoebe. Nobody knows why it is called Phoebe.\nPsychology: (103.) Unk, the big trouble with dumb bastards is that they are too dumb to believe there is such a thing as being smart.\nMedicine: (73.) When they clean out a man\u2019s memory on this place called Mars, they don\u2019t really clean it completely. They just clean out the middle of it, sort of. They always leave a lot of stuff in the corners. There is a story around about how they tried cleaning out a few memories completely. The poor people who had that done to them couldn\u2019t walk, couldn\u2019t talk, couldn\u2019t do anything. The only thing anybody could think of to do with them was to housebreak them, teach them a basic vocabulary of a thousand words, and give them jobs in military or industrial public relations.\nThe short story: (89.) Unk, your best friend is Stony Stevenson. Stony is a big, happy, strong man, and he drinks a quart of whisky a day. Stony doesn\u2019t have an antenna in his head, and he can remember everything that ever happened to him. He pretends to be an intelligence scout, but he is one of the real commanders. He radio-controls a company of assault infantrymen who are going to attack a place on Earth called England. Stony is from England. Stony likes the Army of Mars because there is so much to laugh about. Stony laughs all the time. He heard what an eightball you were, Unk, so he came over to your barrack to have a look at you. He pretended he was a friend of yours, so he could hear you talk. After a while, you got to trust him, Unk, and you told him some of your secret theories about what life on Mars was all about. Stony tried to laugh, but then he realized that you had turned up some things that he didn\u2019t know anything about. He couldn\u2019t get over it, because he was supposed to know everything, and you weren\u2019t supposed to know anything. And then you told Stony a lot of the big questions you wanted answered, and Stony knew the answers to only about half of them. And Stony went back to his barrack, and the questions he didn\u2019t know the answers to kept going around and around in his head. He couldn\u2019t sleep that night, even though he drank and drank and drank. He was catching on that somebody was using him, and he didn\u2019t have any idea who it was. He didn\u2019t even know why there had to be an Army of Mars in the first place. He didn\u2019t even know why Mars was going to attack Earth. And the more he remembered about Earth, the more he realized that the Army of Mars didn\u2019t have the chance of a snowball in hell. The big attack on Earth would be suicide for sure. Stony wondered who he could talk to about this, and there just wasn\u2019t anybody but you, Unk. So Stony staggered out of bed about an hour before sunrise, and he sneaked in your barrack, Unk, and he woke you up. He told you everything about Mars he knew. And he said that from now on he would tell you every bloody thing he found out, and you were supposed to tell him every bloody thing you found out. And every so often you two would get off somewhere and try to fit things together. And he gave you a bottle of whisky. And you both drank from it, and Stony said you were his best bloody friend. He said you were the only bloody friend he had ever had on Mars, even though he laughed all the time, and he cried, and almost woke up people around your bunk.

His name was Guillermo Reyes, and he was able to survive at such an altitude because his suit and helmet were inflated with an artificial atmosphere. People used to be so marvelous, making impossible dreams they made come true.\nColonel Reyes had had an inconclusive discussion with a fellow airman one time as to whether anything felt better than sexual intercourse. He was in contact on his radio now with that same comrade, who was back at the air base in Peru, and who was to tell him when Peru was officially at war with Ecuador.\nColonel Reyes had already activated the brain of the tremendous self-propelled weapon slung underneath his airplane. That was its first taste of life, but already it was madly in love with the radar dish atop the control tower at Guayaquil International Airport, a legitimate military target, since Ecuador kept ten of its own warplanes there. This amazing radar lover under the colonel\u2019s plane was like the great land tortoises of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands to this extent: It had all the nourishment it needed inside its shell.\nSo the word came that it was all right for him to let the thing go.", 0.19476190476190477], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["outer", 0.09875147156519604], ["manuscript", 0.085795449498655], ["space", 0.05988340536557294], ["comradeship", 0.04937573578259802], ["praised", 0.04937573578259802], ["capsules", 0.04937573578259802], ["capsule", 0.04937573578259802], ["continued", 0.04937573578259802], ["individual", 0.04937573578259802], ["agreement", 0.04937573578259802], ["advance", 0.04937573578259802], ["delicacies", 0.04937573578259802], ["hermaphroditic", 0.04937573578259802], ["publisher", 0.04937573578259802], ["orgastic", 0.04937573578259802], ["pleasing", 0.04937573578259802], ["proofread", 0.04937573578259802], ["pleasure", 0.04937573578259802], ["parts", 0.0428977247493275], ["lunch", 0.0428977247493275], ["sinister", 0.0428977247493275], ["suggestion", 0.0428977247493275], ["publishing", 0.0428977247493275], ["reviews", 0.03910833121560634], ["critic", 0.03910833121560634], ["terrific", 0.03910833121560634], ["fu", 0.03910833121560634], ["manchu", 0.03910833121560634], ["opportunity", 0.03910833121560634], ["book", 0.03785247085451413], ["criminal", 0.03641971371605699], ["laundryman", 0.03641971371605699], ["honest", 0.03641971371605699], ["selling", 0.03641971371605699], ["finished", 0.03641971371605699], ["cook", 0.0351776887303894], ["lot", 0.0351776887303894], ["chinese", 0.034334259965456894], ["happiness", 0.034334259965456894], ["fired", 0.034334259965456894], ["provided", 0.034334259965456894], ["seriously", 0.032630320182335824], ["wu", 0.032630320182335824], ["asked", 0.032413159168959725], ["fellow", 0.031189659623202567], ["writers", 0.031189659623202567], ["professional", 0.031189659623202567], ["sam", 0.02994170268278647], ["lay", 0.02994170268278647], ["reading", 0.02884092664861466], ["movies", 0.02884092664861466], ["model", 0.027856248932186377], ["painting", 0.02759890166294708], ["stand", 0.026152309149065307], ["general", 0.026152309149065307], ["wonderful", 0.025404246460527583], ["materials", 0.025404246460527583], ["days", 0.024711648589932054], ["turn", 0.024711648589932054], ["master", 0.024711648589932054], ["understand", 0.024711648589932054], ["loved", 0.024711648589932054], ["moment", 0.024066855398465217], ["food", 0.023463691649515953], ["dear", 0.023463691649515953], ["today", 0.02289710639889507], ["full", 0.022362915615344148], ["painters", 0.021857614481977084], ["job", 0.021857614481977084], ["hand", 0.021857614481977084], ["point", 0.021378237898915863], ["told", 0.021015339165949845], ["incidentally", 0.02092225505621089], ["edith", 0.020487488554950212], ["talk", 0.020487488554950212], ["berman", 0.019609293909172508], ["money", 0.019292784148315773], ["high", 0.018233637556661537], ["find", 0.017282397422923756], ["painter", 0.01698568061624544], ["american", 0.01669809502122905], ["paint", 0.016419095365624553], ["wife", 0.016419095365624553], ["died", 0.01588490458207363], ["picture", 0.015628839402745457], ["circe", 0.014669454785361502], ["thing", 0.014224332832190897], ["time", 0.01383007376575672], ["art", 0.01175562652339102], ["life", 0.01175562652339102], ["great", 0.011427670263472607], ["good", 0.011110833331924185], ["house", 0.010654850489219214], ["gregory", 0.010507669582974923], ["man", 0.010079543078009554]], "sentiment": ["After the hermaphroditic cook died, incidentally, Sam Wu, the laundryman, asked for the job and got it.

He was asking if his sons smelled all the big fish in the net.\nThe sons sniffed, said they did.\nThe big belly of the net, which might or might not hold fish, lay on the bottom. The rim of the net was in air, running from pole-tip to pole-tip in lank parabolas. The rim dipped under water at only one point. That point was the gate. It was also the mouth that would feed fish, if any, into the big belly of the net.\nNow Harry himself was inside the trap. He untied a line from a cleat by the gate, hoisted away, lifted the mouth of the net into air, tied the line to the cleat again. There was no way out of the belly now\u2014not for fish. For fish it was a bowl of doom.\nThe Mary rubbed herself gently against one side of the bowl. Harry and his sons, all in a row, reached into the sea with iron hands, pulled net into air, fed it back to the sea.\nHand-over-hand, the three were making smaller, ever smaller, the place where fish could be. And, as that place grew ever smaller, the Mary crept sideways across the surface of the bowl.\nNo one spoke. It was a magic time. Even the gulls fell silent as the three, purified of all thought, hauled net from the sea.\nThe only place where the fish could be became an oval pool. A seeming shower of dimes flashed in the depths, and that was all. The men kept working, hand-over-hand.\nThe only place where the fish could be now became a curving trough, a deep one, alongside the Mary. It now became a shallower trough as the three men continued to work, hand-over-hand. The father and the two sons paused. A goosefish, a prehistoric monstrosity, a ten-pound tadpole studded with chancres and warts, came to the surface, opened its needle -filled mouth, surrendered. And around the goosefish, the brainless, inedible horror of cartilage, the surface of the sea was blooming with dimpled humps. Big animals were in the dark below.\nHarry and his two big sons set to work again, hand-over-hand, pulling in net and feeding it back. There was almost nowhere for the fish to be.

Leland Clewes had succeeded where I had failed\u2014much to her grateful amazement, I am sure.\nWhat tender memories did I have of Sarah? Much talk about human suffering and what could be done about it\u2014and then infantile silliness for relief. We collected jokes for each other, to use when it was time for relief.

I wouldn\u2019t tell anybody I had been fired until I found myself sitting at the bar of the Black Cat Caf\u00e9. So Professor Stern felt free to talk cheerful nonsense. He owned a unicycle, and he could ride it, and he said he was considering riding it in the academic procession to the graduation ceremonies, which were then only about an hour in the future.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there are strong arguments on both sides,\u201d I said.\nHe had grown up in Shelby, Wisconsin, where practically everybody, including grandmothers, could ride a unicycle. The thing was, a circus had gone broke while playing Shelby 60 years earlier and had abandoned a lot of its equipment, including several unicycles. So more and more people there learned how to ride them, and ordered more unicycles for themselves and their families. So Shelby became and remains today, so far as I know, the Unicycling Capital of the World.\n\u201cDo it!\u201d I said.\n\u201cYOU\u2019VE CONVINCED ME,\u201d he said. He was happy. He was gone, and my thoughts rode the breeze and the sunbeams back to when I was still in uniform, but home from the war, and was offered a job at Tarkington. That happened in a Chinese restaurant on Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I was dining with my mother-in-law and my wife, both of them still sane, and my two legitimate children, Melanie, 11, and Eugene, Jr., 8. My illegitimate son, Rob Roy, conceived in Manila only 2 weeks before, must have been the size of a BB shot.\nI had been ordered to Cambridge in order to take an examination for admission as a graduate student to the Physics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I was to earn a Master\u2019s Degree, and then return to West Point as a teacher, but still a soldier, a soldier to the end.\nMy family, except for the BB, was awaiting me at the Chinese restaurant while I walked there in full uniform, ribbons and all. My hair was cut short on top and shaved down to the skin on the sides and back. People looked at me as though I were a freak. I might as well have been wearing nothing but a black garterbelt.\nThat was how ridiculous men in uniform had become in academic communities, even though a major part of Harvard\u2019s and MIT\u2019s income came from research and development having to do with new weaponry. I would have been dead if it weren\u2019t for that great gift to civilization from the Chemistry Department of Harvard, which was napalm, or sticky jellied gasoline.\nIT WAS NEAR the end of the humiliating walk that somebody said to somebody else behind me, \u201cMy goodness!

But what chance did the old man, who spoke no English, have to pass himself off to his captors as an American? None. It was the blond who was going to do that. And they were both about to be captured. All the old man could do was commit suicide.\nEddie went back over the wall, putting it between himself and the blond. But the blond didn\u2019t care what had become of him. Everything the blond needed was on Buzzer\u2019s body. When Eddie peered over the wall to see if Buzzer was still alive, the blond was stripping the body. The old man now had the pistol. He put its muzzle in his mouth and blew his brains out.\nThe blond walked off with Buzzer\u2019s clothes and dog tags. Buzzer was in his GI underwear and dead, without ID. On the ground between the old man and Buzzer, Eddie found the watch. It was running. It told the right time. Eddie picked it up and put it in his pocket.\nThe rainstorm outside Joe Bane\u2019s pawnshop had stopped. \u201cWhen I got home,\u201d said Eddie, \u201cI wrote Buzzer\u2019s folks. I told \u2019em he\u2019d been killed in a fight with a German, even though the war was over. I told the Army the same thing. I didn\u2019t know the name of the place where he\u2019d died, so there was no way they could look for his body and give him a decent funeral. I had to leave him there. Whoever buried him, unless they could recognize GI underwear, wouldn\u2019t have known he was American. He could have been a German. He could have been anything.\u201d\nEddie snatched the watch from under the pawnbroker\u2019s nose. \u201cThanks for letting me know what it\u2019s worth,\u201d he said. \u201cMakes more sense to keep it for a souvenir.\u201d\n\u201cFive hundred,\u201d said Bane, but Eddie was already on his way out the door.\nTen minutes later, the shoeshine boy returned with a translation of the inscription inside the watch. This was it:\n\u201cTo General Heinz Guderian, Chief of the Army General Staff, who cannot rest until the last enemy soldier is driven from the sacred soil of the Third German Reich.

For instance, he had been reading articles and books on sexual intercourse recently. There was a sexual revolution going on in the country, and women were demanding that men pay more attention to women\u2019s pleasure during sexual intercourse, and not just think of themselves. The key to their pleasure, they said, and scientists backed them up, was the clitoris, a tiny meat cylinder which was right above the hole in women where men were supposed to stick their much larger cylinders.", 0.20532866256550464], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["george", 0.11424937647698868], ["pushed", 0.0725384424800018], ["window", 0.0645270278606676], ["noise", 0.06327182486463787], ["gate", 0.056923292098199886], ["yelled", 0.053706886159747946], ["watch", 0.04675354680135674], ["thought", 0.04611122857840965], ["tough", 0.03988786366077802], ["tank", 0.037948861398799924], ["gun", 0.0362692212400009], ["jerry", 0.0362692212400009], ["bottle", 0.03346238411655172], ["brained", 0.03121285930981074], ["puffs", 0.03121285930981074], ["clank", 0.03121285930981074], ["screaming", 0.03121285930981074], ["leveled", 0.03121285930981074], ["accordions", 0.03121285930981074], ["backfiring", 0.03121285930981074], ["splintering", 0.03121285930981074], ["racing", 0.03121285930981074], ["remembered", 0.03121285930981074], ["sprung", 0.03121285930981074], ["buzz", 0.03121285930981074], ["braced", 0.03121285930981074], ["singing", 0.03121285930981074], ["yanked", 0.03121285930981074], ["roosts", 0.03121285930981074], ["groan", 0.03121285930981074], ["atop", 0.03121285930981074], ["coward", 0.03121285930981074], ["prayer", 0.03121285930981074], ["metallic", 0.03121285930981074], ["banging", 0.03121285930981074], ["deafening", 0.03121285930981074], ["trotted", 0.03121285930981074], ["wall", 0.031169031200904494], ["sammy", 0.028362194077455313], ["submachine", 0.026853443079873973], ["chain", 0.026853443079873973], ["jerk", 0.026853443079873973], ["awful", 0.026853443079873973], ["bigger", 0.026853443079873973], ["clawed", 0.026853443079873973], ["thunder", 0.026853443079873973], ["opening", 0.026853443079873973], ["dogtag", 0.026853443079873973], ["tags", 0.026853443079873973], ["treads", 0.026853443079873973], ["scheme", 0.026853443079873973], ["engine", 0.026853443079873973], ["strikes", 0.026853443079873973], ["billowed", 0.026853443079873973], ["sharp", 0.026853443079873973], ["looked", 0.026556539033405536], ["held", 0.026068841161808083], ["chimes", 0.02430334806032577], ["thumb", 0.02430334806032577], ["terror", 0.02430334806032577], ["winder", 0.02430334806032577], ["forgot", 0.02430334806032577], ["loose", 0.02430334806032577], ["courtyard", 0.02430334806032577], ["turret", 0.02430334806032577], ["slid", 0.02430334806032577], ["evenly", 0.02430334806032577], ["face", 0.02354468147046027], ["snapped", 0.02249402684993721], ["sullivan", 0.02249402684993721], ["carry", 0.02249402684993721], ["resting", 0.02249402684993721], ["chest", 0.02249402684993721], ["crack", 0.021090608288212624], ["surprised", 0.021090608288212624], ["shattered", 0.021090608288212624], ["dust", 0.021090608288212624], ["changing", 0.021090608288212624], ["hell", 0.02096865112271168], ["pistol", 0.01994393183038901], ["filled", 0.01994393183038901], ["helped", 0.01994393183038901], ["huge", 0.01994393183038901], ["wild", 0.018974430699399962], ["tanks", 0.01813461062000045], ["guns", 0.01813461062000045], ["working", 0.01813461062000045], ["wonderful", 0.01813461062000045], ["laughed", 0.01813461062000045], ["drink", 0.01813461062000045], ["carried", 0.017393836810840804], ["quick", 0.01673119205827586], ["open", 0.01673119205827586], ["understand", 0.01673119205827586], ["pocket", 0.0161317569651669], ["cried", 0.0161317569651669], ["kill", 0.015584515600452247], ["listen", 0.015584515600452247], ["happened", 0.015081102344643842], ["table", 0.015081102344643842], ["making", 0.015081102344643842], ["mind", 0.015081102344643842], ["knew", 0.0146150144694632], ["bad", 0.0146150144694632], ["hours", 0.014181097038727657], ["happy", 0.014181097038727657], ["cut", 0.013775194390063687], ["smoke", 0.013775194390063687], ["camp", 0.013775194390063687], ["stood", 0.013393907460400575], ["soldiers", 0.013393907460400575], ["dead", 0.013034420580904042], ["russian", 0.013034420580904042], ["turned", 0.012694375164109855], ["hear", 0.011772340735230135], ["front", 0.011492769901451306], ["couldn", 0.011492769901451306], ["things", 0.009821680808790893], ["big", 0.00922224571568193], ["eyes", 0.008852179677801846], ["war", 0.00867500435096728], ["work", 0.008012359598402333]], "sentiment": ["It was a crack-brained scheme, without a prayer of working. I looked into George\u2019s eyes, and thought I saw that he knew that, too. Maybe, with a buzz on, he thought it would work\u2014but now he seemed to be changing his mind. I looked at the watch on the table, and thought of Jerry Sullivan being carried back into camp dead. George had helped carry him, I remembered.\nI thought of the gun in my pocket. \u201cGo to hell, George,\u201d I said.\nHe didn\u2019t look surprised. He pushed the bottle in front of me. \u201cHave a drink and think it over,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cYou\u2019re just making things tough for both of us.\u201d I pushed the bottle back. \u201cVery tough,\u201d said George. \u201cI want the tags awful bad, Sammy.\u201d\nI braced myself, but nothing happened. He was a bigger coward than I thought.\nGeorge held out the watch, and pushed down the winder with his thumb. \u201cListen, Sammy\u2014it strikes the hours.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t hear the chimes. All hell cut loose outside\u2014the deafening clank and thunder of tanks, backfiring, and wild, happy singing, with accordions screaming above it all.\n\u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d I yelled. The war really was over! I could believe it now. I forgot George, Jerry, the watch\u2014everything but the wonderful noise. I ran to the window. Big puffs of smoke and dust billowed up over the wall, and there was a banging on the gate. \u201cThis is it!\u201d I laughed.\nGeorge yanked me back from the window, and pushed me against the wall. \u201cThis is it, all right!\u201d he said. His face was filled with terror. He held a pistol against my chest. George clawed at my dogtag chain, snapped it with a quick jerk.\nThere was a sharp, splintering noise, a metallic groan, and the gate sprung open. A tank stood in the opening, racing its engine, its huge treads resting against the shattered gate. George turned to face the noise, just as two Russian soldiers slid from roosts atop the tank turret, and trotted into the courtyard, their submachine guns leveled. They looked quickly from window to window, and yelled something I couldn\u2019t understand.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll kill us if they see that gun!\u201d I cried.", 0.07081196581196583], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
