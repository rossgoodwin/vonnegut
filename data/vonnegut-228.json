It wasn\u2019t so much what the Earthlings did as the way they did it that inspired Salo.\nThe Earthlings behaved at all times as though there were a big eye in the sky\u2014as though that big eye were ravenous for entertainment.\nThe big eye was a glutton for great theater. The big eye was indifferent as to whether the Earthling shows were comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, athletics, or vaudeville. Its demand, which Earthings apparently found as irresistible as gravity, was that the shows be great.\nThe demand was so powerful that Earthlings did almost nothing but perform for it, night and day\u2014and even in their dreams.\nThe big eye was the only audience that Earthlings really cared about. The fanciest performances that Salo had seen had been put on by Earthlings who were terribly alone. The imagined big eye was their only audience.\nSalo, with his diamond-hard statues, had tried to preserve some of the mental states of those Earthlings who had put on the most interesting shows for the imagined big eye.\nHardly less surprising than the statues were the Titanic daisies that abounded by the Winston Sea.

["Doctor Ewing J. Halyard was giving himself a ragged manicure with his teeth in one of the waiting chairs, while his charges received their first American haircuts. He smiled and nodded at whatever was being said, but heard nothing save the soft crackle of the letter in his breast pocket as he shifted nervously in a search for comfort no chair could give him. The letter, from the personnel officer of the State Department, had pursued him from New York to Utica to Niagara Falls to Camp Drum to Indianapolis to St. Louis to Fort Riley to Houston to Hollywood to the Grand Canyon to Carlsbad Caverns to Hanford to Chicago to Miami Beach, where he roosted long enough for the letter to catch him\u2014catch him like a javelin, quivering squarely between the shoulder-blades of his spirit. He was lobster-red from a day on the sand, but beneath this stinging veneer of fine health and spirits he was cold and dead-white with fear. \u201cMy dear Mr. Halyard,\u201d it had begun. \u201cMy dear Mr. \u2026\u201d\nWhile Halyard brooded, Homer Bigley, with the reflexes born of a life of barbering, selected his scissors, clicked them in air about the sacred head, and, as though his right hand were serviced by the same nerve as his diaphragm and voicebox, he began to cut hair and talk\u2014talked to the uncomprehending Shah after the fashion of an extroverted embalmer chatting with a corpse.\n\u201cYessir, picked a nice time to come. They call this the off-season, but I say it\u2019s the nicest time of year. Cheapest time, too. But that isn\u2019t what I meant. It\u2019s fifteen degrees cooler right here and now than it is in New York City, and I\u2019ll bet not one person in fifty up north knows that. Just because the fact hasn\u2019t been promoted. Everything\u2019s promotion. Ever stop to think about that? Everything you think you think because somebody promoted the ideas. Education\u2014nothing but promotion.\n\u201cGood promotion and bad promotion. Barbers, now, they get a lot of bad promotion on account of cartoons and television comedians, you know? Can\u2019t pick up a magazine or turn on the television without you see a joke about a barber cutting somebody. And sure, maybe that\u2019s good for a little snicker, maybe, and God knows the world can use a few snickers, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to hurt somebody to give somebody else a snicker. I mean that it all kind of cancels out, and nobody\u2019s ahead. And I just wonder if any of those comedians or cartoon people ever stop to think about the thousands of barbers who go from one year to the next without they ever cut a customer, and still these people go around telling everybody that barbers are slashing so many arteries and veins you wonder how the sewers can handle it all. But seems like nobody ever thinks about what\u2019s maybe sacred to somebody, any more.\n\u201cMatter of fact, of course, used to be barbers did bleed people, of course, and got paid for it, too. One of the oldest professions on earth, if you stop to think about it, but nobody does. Used to be sort of doctors, bleeding people and setting their bones and all, and then the doctors got sore and took over all that stuff and left the barbers haircutting and shaving. Very interesting history. But my father used to say, before he died, of course, that the barbers would be here long after the last doctor\u2019s laid away, and there was a lot in what he said. He was worth listening to.\n\u201cNowadays, by golly, it takes more time and skill to cut hair\u2019n to do what the doctors do. If you had syphilis or the clap or scarlet fever or yellow fever or pneumonia or cancer or something, why, hell, I could cure you while I was drawing the water for a shampoo. Take a little old needle, puncho! squirto! miracle! and give you a clean bill of health along with your change. Any barber could do what a doctor does nowadays. But I\u2019ll give you fifty dollars if you can show me a doctor who can cut hair.\n\u201cNow, they say barbering isn\u2019t a profession, but you take the other professions that got so big for their breeches since the Middle Ages and look down on barbering. You take medicine, you take the law. Machinery!\n\u201cDoctor doesn\u2019t use his head and education to figure out what\u2019s the matter with you. Machines go over you\u2014measure this, measure that. Then he picks out the right miracle stuff, and the only reason he does is on account of the machines tell him that\u2019s what to do. And the lawyers! Of course, I say it\u2019s a pretty good thing what happened to them, because it was a bad thing for them, which couldn\u2019t help to be a good thing for everybody else. I didn\u2019t say that. My father said it. Those are his words. But the law\u2019s the law now, and not a contest between a lot of men paid to grin and lie and yell and finagle for whatever somebody wanted them to grin and lie and yell and finagle about. By golly, the lie detectors know who\u2019s lying and who\u2019s telling the truth, and those old card machines know how the law runs on whatever the case is about, and they can find out a helluva sight quicker\u2019n you can say habeas corpus what judges did about cases like that before. And that settles it. No more of this fast footwork. Hell, if I had a lie detector and card machines and all, I could run a law business here and fix you up with a divorce or a million dollar damage suit or whatever you needed whatsoever while you were sticking your feet and a dime into that shoeshine machine.\n\u201cUsed to be sort of high and mighty, sort of priests, those doctors and lawyers and all, but they\u2019re beginning to look more and more like mechanics. Dentists are holding up pretty good, though. They\u2019re the exception that proves the rule, I say. And barbering\u2014one of the oldest professions on earth, incidentally\u2014has held up better than all the rest. Machines separated the men from the boys, you might say.\n\u201cThe men from the boys\u2014that\u2019s what they used to say in the Army, Sergeant Elm Wheeler would. Memphis boy. \u2018Here we go, boys,\u2019 he\u2019d say. \u2018Here\u2019s where we separate the men from the boys.\u2019 And off we\u2019d go for the next hill, and the medics\u2019d follow and separate the dead from the wounded. And then Wheeler\u2019d say, \u2018Here we go, here\u2019s where we separate the men from the boys.\u2019 And that went on till we got separated from our battalion and Wheeler got his head separated from his shoulders.", 0.14585714433562796], "title": "Player Piano"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["hilton", 0.11922946330614073], ["register", 0.11481973221518044], ["precious", 0.09811739051494078], ["finished", 0.09440291630223575], ["clear", 0.07448295068333292], ["jews", 0.07064615874214575], ["bathrobe", 0.07064615874214575], ["notify", 0.07064615874214575], ["curlers", 0.07064615874214575], ["farce", 0.07064615874214575], ["prettier", 0.07064615874214575], ["grating", 0.07064615874214575], ["gaping", 0.07064615874214575], ["louella", 0.07064615874214575], ["moses", 0.07064615874214575], ["parsons", 0.07064615874214575], ["draw", 0.06229498789202592], ["glued", 0.06229498789202592], ["peculiar", 0.05740986610759022], ["rim", 0.05740986610759022], ["swear", 0.05740986610759022], ["makeup", 0.05740986610759022], ["bothered", 0.05740986610759022], ["tearing", 0.05740986610759022], ["slip", 0.05394381704190611], ["gasket", 0.05394381704190611], ["hill", 0.05394381704190611], ["land", 0.05125534052004816], ["writer", 0.04905869525747039], ["completely", 0.04905869525747039], ["eyebrows", 0.04720145815111788], ["spread", 0.04720145815111788], ["studio", 0.04720145815111788], ["promised", 0.04720145815111788], ["laugh", 0.044173573473034675], ["couch", 0.044173573473034675], ["serious", 0.044173573473034675], ["decided", 0.042904169669928334], ["straight", 0.04175585425059912], ["apart", 0.04175585425059912], ["upstairs", 0.040707524407350565], ["bathroom", 0.040707524407350565], ["expression", 0.03974315443538025], ["funny", 0.03885028730099806], ["bathtub", 0.03885028730099806], ["gloria", 0.03885028730099806], ["telling", 0.03801904788549262], ["murra", 0.03724147534166646], ["tears", 0.036511058211347966], ["free", 0.036511058211347966], ["stand", 0.03582240262291485], ["hadn", 0.03517099031845369], ["care", 0.03517099031845369], ["crazy", 0.034552998819808514], ["hair", 0.03396516551656234], ["close", 0.03340468340047929], ["bring", 0.032356353557230745], ["closed", 0.032356353557230745], ["married", 0.03139198358526042], ["minutes", 0.03139198358526042], ["red", 0.030937280838479134], ["arms", 0.029667877035372794], ["won", 0.02851956161604358], ["open", 0.028159887361228143], ["nice", 0.027471231772795025], ["son", 0.026819819468333877], ["kind", 0.026819819468333877], ["knew", 0.025904326613178184], ["woman", 0.025613994666442517], ["stood", 0.024517949145891595], ["face", 0.024005182707110922], ["wife", 0.019632827361455878], ["wasn", 0.018953876318671157], ["told", 0.01831115365957124], ["eyes", 0.017700988203923594], ["looked", 0.014689641885020779], ["man", 0.013373987764960633]], "sentiment": ["\"I might as well tell you, too,\" she said, \"that I\u2019ve decided to bring this farce to an end.\"\n\"It\u2019s nice of you to make me among the first to know,\" he said. \"Shall I notify Louella Parsons, or has that already been taken care of?\"\nI had the gasket glued onto the bathtub rim, so I was free to close the register.

One man had been butchered for twelve cents, and his murderer was still at large. But he had been a dirty, homeless man\u2014one of those people who were born, seemingly, to be murdered for less than a dollar.\nHenry regarded his tuxedo as a safe-conduct pass through the park\u2014a costume so different from that of the natives as to make him immune to their squalid troublemaking.\nHenry looked at Anne, and found her correctly bored\u2014a pink bonbon in blue tulle, wearing her mother\u2019s pearls and orchids from Henry.", 0.17103174603174603], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["stands", 0.13965257733537134], ["graph", 0.11854553094114989], ["thesis", 0.09564558876852275], ["misfortune", 0.0863360315843371], ["stories", 0.07011959934039164], ["rejected", 0.06982628866768567], ["shape", 0.0665412155722991], ["story", 0.058906282226327794], ["fortune", 0.05733715027921819], ["simple", 0.055619849742203326], ["nearer", 0.049412584986402296], ["overcomes", 0.049412584986402296], ["excluding", 0.049412584986402296], ["fantastically", 0.049412584986402296], ["waking", 0.049412584986402296], ["balmy", 0.049412584986402296], ["prettiest", 0.049412584986402296], ["bearable", 0.049412584986402296], ["crucify", 0.049412584986402296], ["shopping", 0.049412584986402296], ["graphed", 0.049412584986402296], ["intersecting", 0.049412584986402296], ["depict", 0.049412584986402296], ["rockefeller", 0.049412584986402296], ["fundamental", 0.049412584986402296], ["resourcefulness", 0.04316801579216855], ["wedding", 0.04316801579216855], ["doorstep", 0.04316801579216855], ["axes", 0.04316801579216855], ["pots", 0.04316801579216855], ["abstract", 0.04316801579216855], ["spearheads", 0.04316801579216855], ["society", 0.041562938795364136], ["playful", 0.039515176980383294], ["shapes", 0.039515176980383294], ["saturday", 0.039515176980383294], ["jailbird", 0.039515176980383294], ["vanished", 0.039515176980383294], ["happier", 0.039515176980383294], ["lady", 0.03692344659793481], ["societies", 0.03692344659793481], ["demonstrated", 0.03692344659793481], ["post", 0.03692344659793481], ["ill", 0.03692344659793481], ["contribution", 0.03692344659793481], ["master", 0.03692344659793481], ["collected", 0.03692344659793481], ["collier", 0.03692344659793481], ["strength", 0.03692344659793481], ["nelson", 0.03692344659793481], ["beloved", 0.034913144333842835], ["popular", 0.034913144333842835], ["experiences", 0.034913144333842835], ["bottom", 0.034913144333842835], ["bag", 0.03327060778614955], ["drawn", 0.03327060778614955], ["palm", 0.030678877403701073], ["anthropology", 0.030678877403701073], ["day", 0.029840640306334418], ["evening", 0.029617768974364286], ["scale", 0.029617768974364286], ["carry", 0.028668575139609093], ["top", 0.028668575139609093], ["fun", 0.028668575139609093], ["interesting", 0.027809924871101663], ["morning", 0.027809924871101663], ["culture", 0.027809924871101663], ["leading", 0.027809924871101663], ["sunday", 0.027809924871101663], ["clear", 0.027809924871101663], ["afterward", 0.02702603859191581], ["example", 0.026304933117379442], ["late", 0.025015736327823827], ["middle", 0.02443430820946733], ["looked", 0.02443430820946733], ["chicago", 0.023373199780130544], ["paper", 0.02116488934740095], ["set", 0.02116488934740095], ["close", 0.02116488934740095], ["idea", 0.020781469397682068], ["head", 0.020413703681283372], ["speak", 0.0200603639231457], ["ago", 0.01877116713359009], ["will", 0.016964002724696416], ["university", 0.016881792980598474], ["person", 0.01532078648263418], ["long", 0.013310484218542199], ["read", 0.01298869969059554], ["life", 0.009822952962326272], ["good", 0.008578355318354946], ["time", 0.00556092327058624]], "sentiment": ["Jailbird A\nPalm Sunday C\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhat has been my prettiest contribution to my culture? I would say it was a master\u2019s thesis in anthropology which was rejected by the University of Chicago a long time ago. It was rejected because it was so simple and looked like too much fun. One must not be too playful.\nThe thesis has vanished, but I carry an abstract in my head, which I will here set down. The fundamental idea is that stories have shapes which can be drawn on graph paper, and that the shape of a given society\u2019s stories is at least as interesting as the shape of its pots or spearheads.\nIn the thesis, I collected popular stories from fantastically various societies, not excluding the one which used to read Collier\u2019s and The Saturday Evening Post.
