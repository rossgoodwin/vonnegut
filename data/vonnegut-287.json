Crumb) is an American artist and illustrator who was a founder of the underground comics movement.\nDear Don\u2014\nThe book I did with Chermayeff, Sun, Moon, Star, has just come into being. I will send you a copy. Until the book was actually printed, there was not much of anything to see. All Ivan and I could do was to promise that, if the printer did what we told him to do, the result would be wonderful. Because all we had was that promise, we made no book club sales and few foreign sales. The hope now is that we, like Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, will become a part of the nativity story as it is retold every year.\nYou are not mistaken to admire R. Crumb. He makes me proud to be an American. It seems to me that you should approach Playboy Press and Rolling Stone for some sort of help in getting your bibliography published. Strangely enough, Harvard University Press might also be beguiled\u2014or, better still, Yale, whose new president boasts that he reads Variety every day. He also complains that his students waste too much time on the pap I write.", 0.13892045454545454], "title": "Letters"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["ants", 0.23915349821124746], ["dew", 0.11854915529841792], ["survive", 0.11854915529841792], ["ant", 0.09566139928449897], ["nature", 0.08501919878937415], ["wonderful", 0.08122083302283344], ["insects", 0.05927457764920896], ["lecture", 0.05927457764920896], ["waterless", 0.05927457764920896], ["dimensional", 0.05927457764920896], ["er", 0.05927457764920896], ["operation", 0.05927457764920896], ["dimensions", 0.05927457764920896], ["edible", 0.05927457764920896], ["drinkable", 0.05927457764920896], ["dug", 0.05927457764920896], ["experiment", 0.05927457764920896], ["cannibals", 0.05927457764920896], ["peevish", 0.05927457764920896], ["sandwich", 0.05927457764920896], ["responses", 0.05927457764920896], ["ritualized", 0.05927457764920896], ["bead", 0.05927457764920896], ["generate", 0.05927457764920896], ["commenting", 0.05927457764920896], ["thousandth", 0.05927457764920896], ["dirt", 0.05927457764920896], ["solved", 0.05927457764920896], ["response", 0.05927457764920896], ["reduced", 0.05927457764920896], ["op", 0.05927457764920896], ["successful", 0.05205429451837619], ["catching", 0.05205429451837619], ["constructed", 0.05205429451837619], ["watching", 0.05205429451837619], ["sheets", 0.05205429451837619], ["balls", 0.05205429451837619], ["grains", 0.05205429451837619], ["cap", 0.05205429451837619], ["produce", 0.05205429451837619], ["frank", 0.0486904532197925], ["surviving", 0.04783069964224949], ["ate", 0.04783069964224949], ["tight", 0.04783069964224949], ["forming", 0.04783069964224949], ["farm", 0.04783069964224949], ["center", 0.04783069964224949], ["corpses", 0.04783069964224949], ["learn", 0.04783069964224949], ["excused", 0.044834011387543435], ["heat", 0.044834011387543435], ["ruins", 0.044834011387543435], ["bodies", 0.044834011387543435], ["merry", 0.04250959939468708], ["tomorrow", 0.04250959939468708], ["taught", 0.04250959939468708], ["mystery", 0.04250959939468708], ["tiny", 0.04061041651141672], ["drink", 0.039004680263216115], ["eat", 0.039004680263216115], ["number", 0.037613728256710666], ["cave", 0.037613728256710666], ["glass", 0.037613728256710666], ["kill", 0.03638682163529001], ["short", 0.035289316263854315], ["thing", 0.03506304727274144], ["hell", 0.0342965018908926], ["half", 0.033390133380583956], ["thinking", 0.031784397132383346], ["bolivar", 0.031784397132383346], ["place", 0.031065721387727604], ["word", 0.028069033133021552], ["die", 0.028069033133021552], ["water", 0.02756080225625664], ["order", 0.02756080225625664], ["making", 0.02419857942018319], ["ice", 0.022852623883933127], ["three", 0.022239702008694233], ["things", 0.01894956711891843], ["time", 0.01894956711891843], ["good", 0.014725972242791718], ["people", 0.012996960394101498], ["asked", 0.012286457789658438]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWhat other place is there?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll put on my thinking cap.\u201d I excused myself and went down into the cave to see what Frank was up to.\nHe was up to nothing new. He was watching an ant farm he had constructed. He had dug up a few surviving ants in the three-dimensional world of the ruins of Bolivar, and he had reduced the dimensions to two by making a dirt and ant sandwich between two sheets of glass. The ants could do nothing without Frank\u2019s catching them at it and commenting upon it.\nThe experiment had solved in short order the mystery of how ants could survive in a waterless world. As far as I know, they were the only insects that did survive, and they did it by forming with their bodies tight balls around grains of ice-nine. They would generate enough heat at the center to kill half their number and produce one bead of dew. The dew was drinkable. The corpses were edible.\n\u201cEat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,\u201d I said to Frank and his tiny cannibals.\nHis response was always the same.

Paul phoned the cab company, but no one answered. He looked helplessly at the automatic ticket vendor, the automatic nylon vendor, the automatic coffee vendor, the automatic gum vendor, the automatic book vendor, the automatic newspaper vendor, the automatic toothbrush vendor, the automatic Coke vendor, the automatic shoeshine machine, the automatic photo studio, and walked out into the deserted streets on the Homestead side of the river.\nIt was eight miles through Homestead, across the bridge, and up the other side of the river to home. Not home, Paul thought, but the house where his bed was.\nHe felt dull, mushy inside, with an outer glaze of bright heat\u2014sleepy yet sleepless, assailed by thoughts yet thoughtless.\nHis footsteps echoed against Homestead\u2019s gray fa\u00e7ades, and lifeless neon tubes, proclaiming one thing and another of no importance at this hour, were empty, cold glass for want of the magic of electrons in flight through inert gas.\n\u201cLonesome?\u201d", -0.06304112554112554], "title": "Player Piano"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["madge", 0.1666548453755399], ["body", 0.12400622543949762], ["soldiers", 0.11903917526824277], ["marshal", 0.08722084703528975], ["tied", 0.08722084703528975], ["amphibians", 0.07631924077680748], ["copper", 0.06714914279270327], ["field", 0.06581930894435253], ["chartreuse", 0.061883362167921924], ["ankles", 0.050879493851204986], ["colored", 0.050879493851204986], ["enemy", 0.04914531992101638], ["amphibious", 0.04624735172213054], ["gown", 0.03807552711427336], ["colors", 0.03807552711427336], ["sizes", 0.03807552711427336], ["resist", 0.03807552711427336], ["carted", 0.03807552711427336], ["hissing", 0.03807552711427336], ["outlying", 0.03807552711427336], ["goddess", 0.03807552711427336], ["striking", 0.03807552711427336], ["swiped", 0.03807552711427336], ["capture", 0.03807552711427336], ["lame", 0.03807552711427336], ["spangled", 0.03807552711427336], ["waving", 0.03807552711427336], ["dyed", 0.03807552711427336], ["hair", 0.036611801790580184], ["cocky", 0.033574571396351637], ["payoff", 0.033574571396351637], ["jig", 0.033574571396351637], ["giant", 0.033574571396351637], ["fingernails", 0.033574571396351637], ["shapes", 0.033574571396351637], ["nationalities", 0.033574571396351637], ["screamed", 0.033574571396351637], ["fancy", 0.033574571396351637], ["rushed", 0.033574571396351637], ["scarlet", 0.033574571396351637], ["flags", 0.033574571396351637], ["medals", 0.033574571396351637], ["prisoner", 0.033574571396351637], ["cheering", 0.033574571396351637], ["war", 0.03197965966150574], ["padded", 0.030941681083960962], ["cameras", 0.030941681083960962], ["catching", 0.030941681083960962], ["triumphantly", 0.030941681083960962], ["raid", 0.030941681083960962], ["amphibian", 0.030941681083960962], ["dragged", 0.030941681083960962], ["courtroom", 0.030941681083960962], ["gold", 0.029073615678429917], ["billions", 0.029073615678429917], ["joined", 0.029073615678429917], ["trap", 0.029073615678429917], ["grab", 0.029073615678429917], ["uniform", 0.029073615678429917], ["hopeless", 0.029073615678429917], ["road", 0.029073615678429917], ["male", 0.029073615678429917], ["trial", 0.029073615678429917], ["blond", 0.029073615678429917], ["bait", 0.027624631578986997], ["pale", 0.027624631578986997], ["piped", 0.027624631578986997], ["situation", 0.027624631578986997], ["siren", 0.027624631578986997], ["dressed", 0.027624631578986997], ["woman", 0.027609890354736738], ["jail", 0.02644072536603924], ["view", 0.02644072536603924], ["leaning", 0.02644072536603924], ["centers", 0.025439746925602493], ["steps", 0.025439746925602493], ["skin", 0.02457265996050819], ["stared", 0.02457265996050819], ["storage", 0.02457265996050819], ["people", 0.024515473823571537], ["charge", 0.023807835053648557], ["shoulder", 0.023807835053648557], ["hiding", 0.023807835053648557], ["fight", 0.02312367586106527], ["evening", 0.022504778589608615], ["built", 0.022504778589608615], ["case", 0.021939769648117512], ["places", 0.021939769648117512], ["center", 0.021420011806081562], ["spent", 0.021420011806081562], ["tall", 0.021420011806081562], ["bodies", 0.02093879120768077], ["moved", 0.020490785548674593], ["point", 0.02007170424258647], ["attention", 0.02007170424258647], ["major", 0.019678037867155072], ["windows", 0.019678037867155072], ["town", 0.019306879335726834], ["hadn", 0.018955793483322447], ["terrible", 0.018622720143143548], ["pay", 0.018622720143143548], ["blue", 0.018003822871686892], ["dollars", 0.017173736043700625], ["television", 0.016673989023336156], ["help", 0.016437835489759047], ["going", 0.014988324341373545], ["feet", 0.014454837765400725], ["god", 0.013652149739639838], ["young", 0.012544191836842671], ["night", 0.012294410792506334], ["couldn", 0.01170901405877713], ["big", 0.011488874112831147], ["years", 0.01138154098327783], ["turned", 0.010395787652966115], ["thought", 0.010395787652966115], ["wasn", 0.010215400873050038], ["thing", 0.008855983800440469], ["man", 0.007208058340855406]], "sentiment": ["The most striking woman\u2019s body I\u2019d ever seen was in the case\u2014six feet tall and built like a goddess.

Beside that body was the body of a blond, male giant in a pale blue field marshal\u2019s uniform, piped in scarlet and spangled with medals.\nI think the enemy must have swiped the bodies in a raid on one of our outlying storage centers, and padded and dyed them, and dressed them up.\n\"Madge, come back!\" I said.\nThe copper-colored woman with the chartreuse hair moved.

I got into the only body available, the fancy field marshal, to try to help her. It was a hopeless situation, because the field marshal was bait, too, with its ankles tied. The soldiers dragged me after Madge.\nThe cocky young major in charge of the soldiers did a jig along the shoulder of the road, he was so proud. He was the first man ever to capture an amphibian, which was really something from the enemy\u2019s point of view. They\u2019d been at war with us for years, and spent God knows how many billions of dollars, but catching us was the first thing that made any amphibians pay much attention to them.\nWhen we got to the town, people were leaning out of windows and waving their flags, and cheering the soldiers, and hissing Madge and me. Here were all the people who didn\u2019t want to be amphibious, who thought it was terrible for anybody to be amphibious\u2014people of all colors, shapes, sizes, and nationalities, joined together to fight the amphibians.\nIt turned out that Madge and I were going to have a big trial.
