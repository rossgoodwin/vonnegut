You remind me, superficially to be sure, of the late psychiatrist Edmund Bergler, who specialized in treating writers, but who himself wrote more books than had his patients in combination. It is possible that he also owned a baseball team, but I doubt it. He was said to be very good at stud poker. I never met him.\nMarc Leeds has completed his concordance of my works to date, and I have told him that he makes me feel like the soul of an orange whose juice has been extracted, dehydrated, reconstituted, and now awaits a customer in a vast shopping mall. I reminded him, too, of the kidding you and Asa have received for having made a meticulous catalogue of the works of such a minor author. Ah me.\nI don\u2019t consider myself minor, you\u2019ll be happy to hear. I have just been inducted into the upper chamber of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, the Academy, barely in time to vote the Academy out of existence as a separate and nobler entity. From now on, I guess, everybody in the Institute will become a member of the Academy, and the Institute will disappear. The first person to try to make this happen, incidentally, was William James. He was voted down. By whom? By members of the Academy. One nice thing: I got to have my nameplate affixed to the back of one of the numbered chairs. It used to belong to Robert Motherwell, and then Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and then e e cummings (in l.c. on his nameplate) and Douglas Southall Freeman.\nYour latest book suggests to me why so many critics educated as gentlemen at prep schools and then old, elitist colleges and universities dislike my work.
