Peter breathed through his mouth to avoid drawing the room\u2019s dense stench through his long, sensitive nose. \u201cCould it be a child\u2019s toy bass fiddle that got washed into that layer with the ant somehow?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know this place was once a toy factory.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever hear of a toy bass fiddle, let alone one that size?
