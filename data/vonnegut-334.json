"sentiment": ["Some primitive facts which may be of some slight use to you when talking about me to primitive people: I have seven children, four of them adopted. The six who are full grown are monogamous, sober members of their communities\u2014a cabinetmaker, a television writer, a pediatrician, an airline captain, a successful painter, and a successful printmaker. They would have heard the word fuck by the time they were six, whether they had had me for a father or not. As for shit and piss: they spoke of almost nothing else when they were only three, which was surely their idea as much as mine. One man wrote me that he could learn more about sex from talking to a ten-year-old than he could from reading my collected works, which is true. Nowhere have I celebrated the use of any sort of drug, nor sexual promiscuity, nor bad citizenship.\nI express dismay at violence and humorlessness in everything I write, and in my ordinary life as well. I celebrate compassion and tenderness, and parents of every persuasion should be happy to have me do that, and especially those who are enthusiastic about the Beatitudes. Speaking, as the censors do, of giving \u201ca five year old a hand-grenade\u201d: do the censors allow lethal weapons in their homes, or tell war stories within the hearing of children, or allow children to watch TV cartoons where the mouse blows up the cat, or drops a great weight on it from on high, or digs a pit for it lined with spikes! Do they shoot animals, and then show the bullet-riddled corpses as though they were something to be proud of? I never did. As I have already said, six of my children are full grown now, and are admittedly sexy with their legal mates, and are also toilet trained, thanks to all the talk early on about shit and piss. But they surely are not violent.\nCheers,\nKurt Vonnegut\nNovember 30, 1988\nNew York City\nTO LUKAS FOSS\nLukas Foss was a German-born American composer, conductor, and pianist.

It was supposed to look like Aladdin\u2019s lamp. It was an old tin teapot with a piece of cotton stuck in the spout for a wick. Hal bored a hole in it for a doorbell button, which he hooked up to two flashlight batteries and a buzzer inside. Like many husbands back then, he had a workshop in the basement.\nThe idea was, it was a cute way to call servants. You\u2019d rub the teapot as if it were a magic lamp, and you\u2019d push the button on the side. The buzzer\u2019d go off, and a servant, if you had one, would come and ask you what you wished.\nHal didn\u2019t have a servant, but he was going to borrow one from a friend. Hal was a customers\u2019 man in a brokerage house, and he knew his business inside out. He\u2019d made half a million dollars on the stock market, and nobody knew it. Not even his wife.\nHe made the magic lamp as a surprise for his wife. He was going to tell her it was a magic lamp. And then he was going to rub it and wish for a big new house. And then he was going to prove to her that it really was a magic lamp, because every wish was going to come true.\nWhen he made the lamp, the interior decorator was finishing up the insides of a big new French chateau Hal had ordered built out on North Meridian Street.\nWhen Hal made that lamp, he and Mary were living in a shotgun house down in all the soot at Seventeenth and Illinois Street. They\u2019d been married two years, and Hal hadn\u2019t had her out more than five or six times. He wasn\u2019t being stingy. He was saving up to buy her all the happiness a girl could ever ask for, and he was going to hand it to her in one fell swoop.\nHal was ten years older than Mary, so it was easy for him to buffalo her about a lot of things, and one of the things was money. He wouldn\u2019t talk money with her, never let her see a bill or a bank statement, never told her how much he made or what he was doing with it. All Mary had to go by was the piddling allowance he gave her to run the house, so she guessed they were poor as Job\u2019s turkey.\nMary didn\u2019t mind that. That girl was as wholesome as a peach and a glass of milk. Being poor gave her room to swing her religion around. When the end of the month came, and they\u2019d eaten pretty well, and she hadn\u2019t asked Hal for an extra dime, she felt like a little white lamb. And she thought Hal was happy, even though he was broke, because she was giving him a hundred million dollars\u2019 worth of love.\nThere was only one thing about being poor that really bothered Mary, and that was the way Hal always seemed to think she wanted to be rich. She did her best to convince him that wasn\u2019t true.\nWhen Hal would carry on about how well other folks were doing\u2014about the high life at the country clubs and the lakes\u2014Mary\u2019d talk about the millions of folks in China who didn\u2019t have a roof over their heads or anything to eat.", 0.19239546629081514], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["dunno", 0.2199239486275379], ["em", 0.11213741405136697], ["lou", 0.09148490516005946], ["winkler", 0.09020971039381688], ["gabbled", 0.09020971039381688], ["gramma", 0.09020971039381688], ["delaware", 0.09020971039381688], ["courtyards", 0.09020971039381688], ["skyscraper", 0.09020971039381688], ["paved", 0.09020971039381688], ["diseases", 0.09020971039381688], ["walled", 0.09020971039381688], ["cackled", 0.09020971039381688], ["dumps", 0.09020971039381688], ["tenderly", 0.09020971039381688], ["subway", 0.09020971039381688], ["aw", 0.07954590761597156], ["smeared", 0.07954590761597156], ["asphalt", 0.07330798287584597], ["kicking", 0.07330798287584597], ["pack", 0.07330798287584597], ["days", 0.07015729960436883], ["hate", 0.06888210483812626], ["carrying", 0.06888210483812626], ["gee", 0.06888210483812626], ["wearily", 0.06888210483812626], ["hon", 0.06544912712559996], ["gerasone", 0.06027263117758129], ["tired", 0.05821830206028094], ["anti", 0.05821830206028094], ["drive", 0.056406255357875044], ["folks", 0.056406255357875044], ["covered", 0.056406255357875044], ["emerald", 0.056406255357875044], ["shoulder", 0.056406255357875044], ["couple", 0.05478532434775464], ["laid", 0.053319013889226566], ["bet", 0.05198037732015534], ["picked", 0.048547399607629035], ["died", 0.04662181279295202], ["sighed", 0.04662181279295202], ["building", 0.04491064917587164], ["months", 0.04491064917587164], ["car", 0.04491064917587164], ["weren", 0.04412152156990933], ["bed", 0.04265521111138125], ["cried", 0.04197133784106073], ["ago", 0.041316574542310025], ["talking", 0.04008514827040947], ["people", 0.03872187660338479], ["shook", 0.03689069650459032], ["kind", 0.03424684639802633], ["hand", 0.030652771764464713], ["heard", 0.030652771764464713], ["left", 0.025522131633955863], ["head", 0.023786816339412105], ["eyes", 0.022602800321933205], ["man", 0.017077553607565115]], "sentiment": ["\"Sure, sure,\" said Lou, \"you bet.
