Please, buddy\u2014won\u2019t you do things about it? Life could be so great for you.\nI am teaching very hard, since I am so hopelessly square. My kids can write, unfortunately. Algren\u2019s kids can probably write, too, but he is doing himself and them a favor by telling them to get out of town. Jane is out here for a week. She has to go back to nurse her mother, who has a busted hip. And I gave her a polaroid for her 43rd birthday, and she took the greatest picture of Algren that the world has ever seen. We will get copies made. He is a most pleasant fellow, with a pixie wife about Mark\u2019s age. He insisted that his wife be given a job, too, and she is busting her ass in the Speech Department, working about twelve hours to his one.\nBourjaily has very quickly turned into a friend. We had him and his wife over for drinks a couple of nights ago, and everybody said it was amazing that they came. It was the first time they had been out since the accident, evidently. I ride horseback with Tina from time to time. It\u2019s crazy. I used to be a real good rider, and then I forgot all about it. I keep thinking I can\u2019t do anything, which is dead wrong. I also swim every couple of days, and do pushups and situps, and smoke worse than ever, and write not at all.\nDuring my first two weeks, I wrote a master\u2019s thesis in anthropology, which I\u2019ve owed Chicago for 18 years. I called them up when it was done, and they said I could still have the degree if it was any good. It might be good. I am waiting for the typist to return it to me so I can find out. It\u2019s about how a story-teller, any good story-teller anywhere, works.\nI\u2019m glad I came, to the extent that I can be glad about anything. You want to come out here? Why not? There are four movie houses within a block of each other, and they change bills every three days.

He concluded and published as a certainty that ionization was relatively unimportant in condensation.\nAt about the same time, friends and neighbors, the Scottish physicist Charles Thomson Rees Wilson performed similar experiments with a cloud chamber made of glass. The canny Scot proved that ions produced by X rays and radioactivity had a lot to do with condensation. He criticized Uncle Carl for ignoring contamination from the wood walls of his chamber, for his crude method of making clouds, and for not shielding his fog from the electrical field of his X-ray apparatus.\nWilson went on to make paths of electrically charged particles visible to the naked eye by means of his cloud chamber. In 1927, he shared a Nobel Prize for Physics for doing this.\nUncle Carl must have felt like something the cat drug in!\n56\nA Luddite to the end, as was Kilgore Trout, as was Ned Ludd, the possibly but not certainly fictitious workman who smashed up machinery, supposedly, in Leicestershire, England, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, I persist in pecking away at a manual typewriter. That still leaves me technologically several generations ahead of William Styron and Stephen King, who, like Trout, write with pens on yellow legal pads.\nI correct my pages with pen or pencil. I have come into Manhattan on business. I telephone a woman who has been doing my retyping for years and years now. She doesn\u2019t have a computer, either. Maybe I should can her. She has moved from the city to a country town. I ask her what the weather is like out that way. I ask if there have been any unusual birds at her bird feeder. I ask if squirrels have found a way to get at it, and so on.\nYes, the squirrels have found a new way to get at the feeder. They can become trapeze artists, if they have to.\nShe has had back trouble in the past. I ask her how her back is. She says her back is OK. She asks how my daughter Lily is. I say Lily is OK.

The sergeant clapped his hand over the youngster\u2019s mouth.\nPi Ying leaned over the balustrade and pointed a finger at the struggling soldier. \"For those who run from the board or make an outcry, a special form of death can be arranged,\" he said sharply. \"Colonel Kelly and I must have complete silence in which to concentrate. If the colonel is clever enough to win, then all of you who are still with us when I am checkmated will get safe transport out of my territory. If he loses\u2014\" Pi Ying shrugged. He settled back on a mound of cushions. \"Now, you must all be good sports,\" he said briskly. \"Americans are noted for that, I believe. As Colonel Kelly can tell you, a chess game can very rarely be won\u2014any more than a battle can be won\u2014 without sacrifices. Isn\u2019t that so, Colonel?\"\nColonel Kelly nodded mechanically. He was recalling what Pi Ying had said earlier\u2014that the game he was about to play was no different, philosophically, from what he had known in war.\n\"How can you do this to children!\" cried Margaret suddenly, twisting free of a guard and striding across the squares to stand directly below Pi Ying\u2019s balcony. \"For the love of God\u2014\" she began.\nPi Ying interrupted angrily: \"Is it for the love of God that Americans make bombs and jet planes and tanks?\" He waved her away impatiently. \"Drag her back.\" He covered his eyes. \"Where was I? We were talking about sacrifices, weren\u2019t we? I was going to ask you who you had chosen to be your king\u2019s pawn,\" said Pi Ying. \"If you haven\u2019t chosen one, Colonel, I\u2019d like to recommend the noisy young man down there\u2014the one the sergeant is holding. A delicate position, king\u2019s pawn.\"\nThe corporal began to kick and twist with new fury. The sergeant tightened his arms about him. \"The kid\u2019ll calm down in a minute,\" he said under his breath. He turned his head toward Colonel Kelly. \"Whatever the hell the king\u2019s pawn is, that\u2019s me. Where do I stand, sir?\" The youngster relaxed and the sergeant freed him.\nKelly pointed to the fourth square in the second row of the huge chessboard. The sergeant strode to the square and hunched his broad shoulders. The corporal mumbled something incoherent, and took his place in the square next to the sergeant\u2014a second dependable pawn. The rest still hung back.\n\"Colonel, you tell us where to go,\" said a lanky T-4 uncertainly. \"What do we know about chess? You put us where you want us.\" His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed. \"Save the soft spots for your wife and kids. They\u2019re the ones that count. You tell us what to do.\"\n\"There are no soft spots,\" said the pilot sardonically, \"no soft spots for anybody. Pick a square, any square.\" He stepped onto the board. \"What does this square make me?\"\n\"You\u2019re a bishop, Lieutenant, the king\u2019s bishop,\" said Kelly.", 0.08356893767608056], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["genevieve", 0.3290060560820422], ["ahem", 0.28474908967909884], ["promise", 0.24728167451369637], ["rudy", 0.18209072655213168], ["stink", 0.14237454483954942], ["apologize", 0.14237454483954942], ["showing", 0.14237454483954942], ["exits", 0.14237454483954942], ["scare", 0.14237454483954942], ["starts", 0.12364083725684819], ["hello", 0.12364083725684819], ["desk", 0.11268232082149239], ["closet", 0.10490712967414696], ["office", 0.09887622288187102], ["scared", 0.09887622288187102], ["bath", 0.09887622288187102], ["fault", 0.09887622288187102], ["scene", 0.08978237864886526], ["putting", 0.08978237864886526], ["standing", 0.08014251529916981], ["clean", 0.08014251529916981], ["front", 0.05537790092419264], ["things", 0.05136654943450957], ["door", 0.05136654943450957], ["brother", 0.03774749049068749], ["felix", 0.0369130097509598], ["going", 0.03039793061275123]], "sentiment": ["FELIX: I\u2019m going back to the office.

They would later move him up to the sun deck, where he would regain consciousness briefly\u2014long enough for him and Mary Hepburn to become man and wife.\n*Siegfried then came back down to tell the Captain that it was his turn to get aboard. The Captain, knowing he was going to make a fool of himself while trying to reach the roof, played for time. Jumping while drunk was easy. Climbing anything the least bit complicated was something else again. Why so many of us a million years ago purposely knocked out major chunks of our brains with alcohol from time to time remains an interesting mystery. It may be that we were trying to give evolution a shove in the right direction\u2014in the direction of smaller brains.\nSo the Captain, playing for time, and trying to sound judicious and respectable, although he could scarcely stand up, said to his brother, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that man was well enough to be moved.\u201d\n*Siegfried was out of patience with him. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s too damn bad, isn\u2019t it\u2014because we just moved the poor bastard anyway. Maybe we should have called a helicopter instead, and had him flown to the bridal suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.\u201d\nAnd those would be the last words the brothers von Kleist would ever exchange, except for \u201cHup!\u201d and \u201cAllez oop!\u201d and \u201cWhoops!\u201d and so on, as the Captain tried and failed to get up on the roof of the bus again and again.\nBut he finally did get up, although thoroughly humiliated. He was at least able to go from the roof to the ship without further assistance. And then *Siegfried told Mary to get on the ship with the rest of them, and to do what she could for *Wait, whom they believed to be Willard Flemming. She did as she was told, thinking it was a matter of manly pride for him to climb to the roof without assistance.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThat left *Siegfried all alone on the wharf, looking up at the rest of them. And they expected him to join them, but that was not to be. He sat down in the driver\u2019s seat instead. Despite his limbs\u2019 jerking this way and that, he started up the engine. His plan was to head back for the city at top speed, and to kill himself by smashing into something.", 0.03057666328942925], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["opera", 0.22970450994512992], ["bravely", 0.11485225497256496], ["clocks", 0.11485225497256496], ["worldly", 0.11485225497256496], ["seduces", 0.11485225497256496], ["mistress", 0.0997838380038705], ["believes", 0.0997838380038705], ["cast", 0.0997838380038705], ["smiling", 0.09096937913195388], ["freeze", 0.09096937913195388], ["saved", 0.08471542103517604], ["break", 0.08471542103517604], ["comfortable", 0.07986447426747582], ["advice", 0.07986447426747582], ["warm", 0.07986447426747582], ["forever", 0.07986447426747582], ["painter", 0.07902034025818531], ["holding", 0.07590096216325942], ["discovered", 0.06964700406648158], ["count", 0.06964700406648158], ["forget", 0.0670865032913428], ["stopped", 0.06272409686825256], ["heart", 0.060832545194564956], ["leave", 0.060832545194564956], ["started", 0.05909248633209677], ["apprentice", 0.05909248633209677], ["son", 0.057481443459189784], ["week", 0.057481443459189784], ["stay", 0.055981598426864745], ["age", 0.05457858709778712], ["great", 0.05316350948658996], ["hands", 0.052018086322648344], ["care", 0.052018086322648344], ["boy", 0.05084271194720757], ["happened", 0.048666984587273164], ["death", 0.04668933723497475], ["beautiful", 0.044876693562386695], ["money", 0.044876693562386695], ["love", 0.044024069363402314], ["young", 0.044024069363402314], ["will", 0.030695711257176034], ["house", 0.024784108746662085], ["time", 0.0160849770971301]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWhere do I think who should go next?\u201d she said.\n\u201cUs,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou mean after we go leave this warm house forever, smiling bravely and holding hands?\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s an opera for you that\u2019ll break your heart.\u201d\n\u201cOpera?\u201d I said.\n\u201cThe beautiful, worldly mistress of a great painter twice her age seduces his apprentice, almost young enough to be her son,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are discovered.

She led me through a tunnel under Lexington Avenue, and up a staircase into the lobby of the Chrysler Building. She skied across the floor to a waiting elevator, with me trotting behind. A guard shouted at us, but we got into the elevator before he could stop us. The doors shut in his angry face as Mary Kathleen punched the button for the topmost floor.\nWe had the car all to ourselves, and upward we flew. Within a trice the doors slithered open on a place of unearthly beauty and peace within the building\u2019s stainless-steel crown. I had often wondered what was up there. Now I knew. The crown came to a point seventy feet above us. Between us and the point, as I looked upward in awe, there was nothing but a lattice of girders and air, air, air.\n\u201cWhat a glorious waste of space!\u201d I thought. But then I saw that there were tenants after all. Myriads of bright yellow little birds were perched on the girders, or flitting through the prisms of light admitted by the bizarre windows, by the great triangles of glass that pierced the crown.\nThe vast floor at whose edge we stood was carpeted in grassy green. There was a fountain splashing at its center. There were garden benches and statues everywhere, and here and there a harp.\nAs I have already said, this was the showroom of The American Harp Company, which had recently become a subsidiary of The RAMJAC Corporation. The company had occupied this space since the building opened in Nineteen-hundred and Thirty-one. All the birds I saw, which were prothonotary warblers, were descended from a single pair released back then.\nThere was a Victorian gazebo near the elevator, which contained the desks of the salesman and his secretary.

My uniform\u2014gray suit, Homburg hat, and navy blue overcoat\u2014is paid for, and after I get a half-dozen more white shirts, I\u2019m going to buy some stock.\nWe in the investment counseling business have a standard question, which goes, \u201cMr. X, sir, before we can make our analyses and recommendations, we\u2019d like to know just what it is you want from your portfolio: income or growth?\u201d A portfolio is a nest egg in the form of stocks and bonds. What the question tries to get at is, does the client want to put his nest egg where it will grow, not paying much in dividends at first, or does he want the nest egg to stay about the same size but pay nice dividends?\nThe usual answer is that the client wants his nest egg to grow and pay a lot of dividends. He wants to get richer fast. But I\u2019ve had plenty of unusual answers, particularly from clients who, because of some kind of mental block, can\u2019t take money in the abstract seriously. When asked what they want from their portfolio, they\u2019re likely to name something they\u2019re itching to blow money on\u2014a car, a trip, a boat, a house.\nWhen I put the question to a client named Otto Krummbein, he said he wanted to make two women happy: Kitty and Falloleen.\nOtto Krummbein is a genius, designer of the Krummbein Chair, the Krummbein Di-Modular Bed, the body of the Marittima-Frascati Sports Racer, and the entire line of Mercury Kitchen Appliances.", 0.1529947916666667], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["creature", 0.0998458643888975], ["extinguisher", 0.0886218413203991], ["creator", 0.08154601043649341], ["universe", 0.06074835817694185], ["book", 0.05678926454143316], ["fire", 0.04992293219444875], ["climber", 0.04431092066019955], ["waldorf", 0.04431092066019955], ["fragile", 0.04431092066019955], ["excelsior", 0.04431092066019955], ["shavings", 0.04431092066019955], ["sammy", 0.04431092066019955], ["congratulated", 0.04431092066019955], ["introducing", 0.04431092066019955], ["astoria", 0.04431092066019955], ["endured", 0.04431092066019955], ["smeared", 0.04431092066019955], ["urge", 0.04431092066019955], ["fictitious", 0.04431092066019955], ["velocity", 0.04431092066019955], ["thumb", 0.03848615443700673], ["ability", 0.03848615443700673], ["jr", 0.03848615443700673], ["premise", 0.03848615443700673], ["yelling", 0.03848615443700673], ["objects", 0.03848615443700673], ["experimental", 0.03848615443700673], ["blizzard", 0.03848615443700673], ["packages", 0.03848615443700673], ["mountain", 0.03848615443700673], ["higher", 0.03848615443700673], ["countryside", 0.03848615443700673], ["discomfort", 0.03848615443700673], ["dance", 0.03507888462097174], ["wood", 0.03507888462097174], ["apologized", 0.03507888462097174], ["preparing", 0.03507888462097174], ["banquet", 0.03507888462097174], ["empire", 0.03507888462097174], ["experiment", 0.03507888462097174], ["supernatural", 0.03507888462097174], ["protect", 0.03507888462097174], ["davis", 0.03507888462097174], ["driver", 0.03322962508503223], ["shrugged", 0.03266138821381392], ["homicidal", 0.03266138821381392], ["maniac", 0.03266138821381392], ["meeting", 0.03266138821381392], ["trade", 0.030786232320417193], ["fully", 0.030786232320417193], ["galaxie", 0.030786232320417193], ["invited", 0.030786232320417193], ["poem", 0.030786232320417193], ["disappeared", 0.030786232320417193], ["creatures", 0.029254118397778923], ["sing", 0.029254118397778923], ["test", 0.029254118397778923], ["robot", 0.029254118397778923], ["sound", 0.02795873453368431], ["programmed", 0.0268366219906211], ["power", 0.0268366219906211], ["language", 0.0268366219906211], ["simple", 0.025846848581743926], ["brand", 0.025846848581743926], ["hotel", 0.025846848581743926], ["robots", 0.025846848581743926], ["letter", 0.024961466097224376], ["form", 0.023429352174586103], ["dead", 0.022756724379010166], ["turn", 0.022756724379010166], ["trout", 0.022554668494506363], ["thinking", 0.022133968310491497], ["famous", 0.021554196281189382], ["sign", 0.021554196281189382], ["honor", 0.021554196281189382], ["word", 0.021011855767428284], ["felt", 0.020502405163928827], ["close", 0.020022082358551106], ["york", 0.020022082358551106], ["meant", 0.019567735961321903], ["room", 0.019136699874031562], ["inside", 0.0187266984944565], ["mind", 0.0187266984944565], ["asked", 0.018335773993322948], ["sort", 0.01796222977003863], ["named", 0.015453885328391603], ["high", 0.015187089544235463], ["thing", 0.014677638940736011], ["knew", 0.01419731613535829], ["long", 0.013742969738129085], ["wanted", 0.012322160241961571], ["life", 0.011270369124701016], ["black", 0.01063585187673341], ["told", 0.01063585187673341], ["looked", 0.008256639642145845], ["dwayne", 0.007744793330946712], ["city", 0.00727966648150835], ["hoover", 0.007077166048070866]], "sentiment": ["And then Trout saw that a simple fire extinguisher in the Galaxie had this brand name:\nAs far as Trout knew, this word meant higher in a dead language.

It was a creature with the ability to make up its own mind. All the other creatures were fully-programmed robots.\nThe book was in the form of a long letter from The Creator of the Universe to the experimental creature.
