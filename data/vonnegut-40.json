April 10. I will go on writing short stories, and Littauer will go on showing them to you, and perhaps you\u2019ll go on finding some that fill your current needs.\nI don\u2019t think you got stung on \u201cTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow.\u201d I think it is funny and not far from an important truth. The Schwartzes are hopeless and helpless the way Sad Sack was hopeless and helpless, the way Charlie Chaplin\u2019s little tramp was hopeless and helpless. Sad Sack and the little tramp are the really beloved American folk heroes (for America here and now), not Paul Bunyan and Colonel Flip Corkin and Andrew Carnegie.\nThis country is being managed to death, being public related to death. You say, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be alarmed at all this.\u201d Well, taken along with everything else, it is terribly alarming and depressing.\nIf, in trying to be a weighty thinker, I have been a crashing bore, then that is a professional matter, and I should be ashamed, and should humbly promise to try to do better. And I will try. But the Commandant\u2019s Desk was buried because it was critical of the Army (mildly, oh so mildly), \u201cTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\u201d because it did not seem to conform to accepted mores; the first version of the cave story because it was pessimistic \u2026 How can humor be written without pathos? How can problems be pointed out without criticism? How can new ideas be introduced without contrasting with old ones? Who are the good editorialists that I should study in order to become a good editorialist myself?\nWild as my stories may be, I would never make World War III seem little more hazardous than and as interesting as an automobile trip from New York to Los Angeles in a Stutz Bearcat.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch any of the atom-bombed buildings, Angel\u2014you\u2019ll get your lily-white hands dirty on the charcoal.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t kiss me now\u2014here comes somebody.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, who\u2019s that scrambling over the rubble toward us but Jacob Malik, wearing a zoot-suit, chewing gum, playing with a yo-yo, and rooting for the Dodgers. Have some of mom\u2019s apple pie, Jake.\u201d\nWell, Knox, I can\u2019t think of a letter more mis-addressed than this one. I don\u2019t know why I should be writing you all this (coals to Newcastle), except that yours of April 10 compels an answer, and I wouldn\u2019t be such a damn fool as to say anything but \u201cYes-sir, you\u2019re so right, sir,\u201d to Mr. Anthony. I want more Collier\u2019s money, need more Collier\u2019s money, and will do my best to get it.\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that I can go on much longer making a living as a short story writer. After the novel comes out, picking its way through beds of tender mores and folkways with the grace of a ballet dancer, I hope to get a job in Hollywood. I\u2019ve got a wife and two kids, and have to do something that will bring in money steadily.", 0.14871289424860853], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["fond", 0.20407665833128796],

It was addressed to Nancy in smeary pencil. She was splendid with anger and disgust as she opened it, knowing it would be a piece of filth from Billy.\nShe was right. Inside the envelope was a poem. It wasn\u2019t an original poem. It was a song from olden days that had taken on new meanings since the numbness of ethical birth control had become universal. It went like this, in smeary pencil again:\nWe were walking through the park, A-goosing statues in the dark. If Sherman\u2019s horse can take it, So can you.\nWhen Nancy came into the suicide booth to see what he wanted, the Foxy Grandpa was lying on the mint-green Barcalounger, where hundreds had died so peacefully over the years. He was studying the menu from the Howard Johnson\u2019s next door and beating time to the Muzak coming from the loudspeaker on the lemon-yellow wall. The room was painted cinder block. There was one barred window with a Venetian blind.\nThere was a Howard Johnson\u2019s next door to every Ethical Suicide Parlor, and vice versa. The Howard Johnson\u2019s had an orange roof and the Suicide Parlor had a purple roof, but they were both the Government. Practically everything was the Government.\nPractically everything was automated, too. Nancy and Mary and the sheriff were lucky to have jobs. Most people didn\u2019t. The average citizen moped around home and watched television, which was the Government. Every fifteen minutes his television would urge him to vote intelligently or consume intelligently, or worship in the church of his choice, or love his fellowmen, or obey the laws\u2014or pay a call to the nearest Ethical Suicide Parlor and find out how friendly and understanding a Hostess could be.\nThe Foxy Grandpa was something of a rarity, since he was marked by old age, was bald, was shaky, had spots on his hands. Most people looked twenty-two, thanks to anti-aging shots they took twice a year. That the old man looked old was proof that the shots had been discovered after his sweet bird of youth had flown.\n\"Have we decided on a last supper yet?\" Nancy asked him. She heard peevishness in her own voice, heard herself betray her exasperation with Billy the Poet, her boredom with the old man. She was ashamed, for this was unprofessional of her. \"The breaded veal cutlet is very good.\"\nThe old man cocked his head. With the greedy cunning of second childhood, he had caught her being unprofessional, unkind, and he was going to punish her for it. \"You don\u2019t sound very friendly. I thought you were all supposed to be friendly. I thought this was supposed to be a pleasant place to come.\n\"I beg your pardon,\" she said. \"If I seem unfriendly, it has nothing to do with you.\"", 0.22100596557913624], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["apple", 0.2294997726823056], ["troy", 0.12590947647257017], ["helen", 0.12590947647257017], ["aphrodite", 0.08393965098171345], ["angry", 0.08393965098171345], ["dare", 0.0764999242274352], ["legend", 0.0764999242274352], ["claim", 0.0764999242274352], ["prize", 0.07122135409070528], ["forward", 0.060953174495559904], ["galaxy", 0.04832897393636081], ["irrelevancies", 0.04832897393636081], ["rabies", 0.04832897393636081], ["chose", 0.04832897393636081], ["hera", 0.04832897393636081], ["yard", 0.04832897393636081], ["echo", 0.04832897393636081], ["enthusiasms", 0.04832897393636081], ["conflagrations", 0.04832897393636081], ["athena", 0.04832897393636081], ["petrified", 0.04832897393636081], ["goddesses", 0.04832897393636081], ["garbled", 0.04832897393636081], ["finalists", 0.04832897393636081], ["mashed", 0.04832897393636081], ["hips", 0.04832897393636081], ["timber", 0.041969825490856726], ["masterpiece", 0.041969825490856726], ["goddess", 0.041969825490856726], ["mortal", 0.041969825490856726], ["apples", 0.041969825490856726], ["accept", 0.041969825490856726], ["stepped", 0.041969825490856726], ["ornate", 0.0382499621137176], ["prince", 0.0382499621137176], ["acknowledge", 0.0382499621137176], ["vertical", 0.0382499621137176], ["spring", 0.0382499621137176], ["artistic", 0.0382499621137176], ["paris", 0.03561067704535264], ["realize", 0.03561067704535264], ["chamber", 0.03561067704535264], ["embarrassing", 0.03561067704535264], ["dog", 0.03561067704535264], ["windshield", 0.033563488501185575], ["1943", 0.033563488501185575], ["difference", 0.033563488501185575], ["doorway", 0.033563488501185575], ["tiny", 0.033563488501185575], ["contest", 0.033563488501185575], ["held", 0.031890813668213516], ["fool", 0.031890813668213516], ["keedsler", 0.031890813668213516], ["beauty", 0.031890813668213516], ["produced", 0.030476587247779952], ["golden", 0.030476587247779952], ["bit", 0.02925152859984855], ["moment", 0.028170950291074394], ["celia", 0.02764510171320671], ["foot", 0.027204340055681495], ["stopped", 0.027204340055681495], ["allowed", 0.027204340055681495], ["walked", 0.027204340055681495], ["stayed", 0.026329934736375758], ["father", 0.023953674943929127], ["matter", 0.02348447667854237], ["idea", 0.022892380154344468], ["hand", 0.022892380154344468], ["named", 0.021811801845570307], ["beautiful", 0.021811801845570307], ["ago", 0.021315772292632002], ["called", 0.020845191610177408], ["center", 0.020845191610177408], ["looked", 0.020845191610177408], ["hands", 0.020397575425136746], ["car", 0.01997078629087167], ["young", 0.017758290356771782], ["things", 0.017436351642906918], ["great", 0.017125328233038282], ["left", 0.01571110181260472], ["night", 0.014486043164673322], ["long", 0.01403842697963266], ["house", 0.013611637845367588], ["felix", 0.012530104227390024], ["going", 0.010318563602493537], ["midland", 0.009483960132716228], ["years", 0.008359168186915013], ["city", 0.007679278534128573]], "sentiment": ["All alone, he walked to the center of the great new doorway, and he stopped there, and he put his hands on his hips, and he looked all around at the galaxy of tiny conflagrations.\nHe should have been angry, and he would get angry later.

He was only a yard or two from Felix, and he held an apple in his hand. Celia could see him through the windshield of the Keedsler. He called out, with our house as an echo chamber, \u201cLet Helen of Troy come forward\u2014to claim this apple, if she dare!\u201d\nCelia stayed right where she was.

For that matter, what did Father know? He had the legend all garbled, as I now realize. Nobody ever gave Helen of Troy an apple\u2014not as a prize, anyway.\nIt was the goddess Aphrodite who was given a golden apple in the legend\u2014as a prize for being the most beautiful of all the goddesses.

Law enforcement officers in the town near Ardennes Farm took to crediting him with unsolved purse-snatchings and burglaries, but his face was seen in police circulars and nowhere else. The situation spelled moments of depression for the General, who in them would surmise gloomily that Banghart had fled the country or been among the dozens of unidentified bums killed every month while hopping freight trains.\nUnder the General\u2019s urging, the State Police withdrew their sentinel. A visiting neighbor laughed himself hoarse over the jungle of weapons in the sunroom, and on the following morning the bulletin board informed Haley that he was to put a light coat of oil on all of the guns and return them, save two, to their racks. The General kept out the single-shot duck gun, which he leaned against the frame of the back door, and he carried a .45-caliber service revolver slung on his belt whenever he left the farmhouse.\n\u201cYou people keep away from this shotgun unless you absolutely have to use it,\u201d he ordered. \u201cLeave Banghart to me. I\u2019d feel safer locked in a phone booth with him than I would knowing one of you was on the prowl with this cannon. Guns and women can make an atom bombing look like an ice cream social,\u201d he declared. \u201cOnly this morning I read a story in the paper about a woman who shot her husband, the cat, and the water-softener because she thought she heard suspicious noises downstairs.\u201d Haley searched the paper for this fascinating item, but was unable to find anything like it.\nOn the afternoon of the same day, Haley came upon the General unexpectedly, to find him standing before the closed door of the corncrib. He had his pistol in hand, cocked, and pointed at the door. \u201cAll right, Banghart,\u201d he was saying, \u201cI\u2019ll give you three to come out. One\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the shotgun,\u201d cried Haley.\nThe General looked at him quickly, with a trifle of embarrassment, Haley thought. With a gesture that seemed perfectly reasonable at the time, the General motioned for Haley to be deathly still. \u201cAll right, Banghart, come out or it\u2019s curtains,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo.\u201d He paused a long while. Haley covered his ears. The General kicked open the crib door and stood poised, ready to shoot.", 0.13543417366946775], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["earl", 0.05543955620789971], ["warren",

opened the drapes and was no wiser as to what was outside. The view was still blocked by a venetian blind, which he hoisted clatteringly. Bright sunlight came crashing in. There were thousands of parked automobiles out there, twinkling on a vast lake of blacktop. Billy\u2019s office was part of a suburban shopping center.\nRight outside the window was Billy\u2019s own Cadillac El Dorado Coupe de Ville. He read the stickers on the bumper. \u201cVisit Ausable Chasm,\u201d said one. \u201cSupport Your Police Department,\u201d said another. There was a third. \u201cImpeach Earl Warren,\u201d it said. The stickers about the police and Earl Warren were gifts from Billy\u2019s father-in-law, a member of the John Birch Society. The date on the license plate was 1967, which would make Billy Pilgrim forty-four years old. He asked himself this: \u201cWhere have all the years gone?\u201d\nBilly turned his attention to his desk. There was an open copy of The Review of Optometry there. It was opened to an editorial, which Billy now read, his lips moving slightly.\nWhat happens in 1968 will rule the fate of European optometrists for at least 50 years! Billy read. With this warning, Jean Thiriart, Secretary of the National Union of Belgium Opticians, is pressing for formation of a \u201cEuropean Optometry Society.\u201d The alternatives, he says, will be the obtaining of professional status, or, by 1971, reduction to the role of spectacle-sellers.\nBilly Pilgrim tried hard to care.\nA siren went off, scared the hell out of him. He was expecting World War Three at any time. The siren was simply announcing high noon. It was housed in a cupola atop a firehouse across the street from Billy\u2019s office.\nBilly closed his eyes. When he opened them, he was back in World War Two again. His head was on the wounded rabbi\u2019s shoulder. A German was kicking his feet, telling him to wake up, that it was time to move on.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe Americans, with Billy among them, formed a fools\u2019 parade on the road outside.\nThere was a photographer present, a German war correspondent with a Leica. He took pictures of Billy\u2019s and Roland Weary\u2019s feet. The picture was widely published two days later as heartening evidence of how miserably equipped the American Army often was, despite its reputation for being rich.", -0.018149001536098306], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["race", 0.18231649787650228], ["chimpanzee", 0.1119830382990274], ["guessing", 0.10276792220566001], ["human", 0.10241386526048527], ["husband", 0.10163671145801902], ["beatrice", 0.09594177460186501], ["california", 0.09115824893825114], ["future", 0.07323876347542681], ["hollywood", 0.06944207973308213], ["ringing", 0.0638681916558767], ["transfer", 0.0638681916558767], ["subsided", 0.0638681916558767], ["chimpanzees", 0.0638681916558767], ["coconuts", 0.0638681916558767], ["tiredly", 0.0638681916558767], ["mystery", 0.0638681916558767], ["dies", 0.0638681916558767], ["wagged", 0.0638681916558767], ["wife", 0.06204611608684058], ["static", 0.0559915191495137], ["chimes", 0.0559915191495137], ["problems", 0.0559915191495137], ["meal", 0.0559915191495137], ["laughs", 0.05138396110283001], ["rhinestone", 0.05138396110283001], ["whore", 0.05138396110283001], ["price", 0.05138396110283001], ["phone", 0.05138396110283001], ["games", 0.05138396110283001], ["swimming", 0.05138396110283001], ["thrown", 0.04811484664315068], ["perspective", 0.04557912446912557], ["ordinary", 0.04557912446912557], ["ghastly", 0.04557912446912557], ["thought", 0.044473618626988724], ["going", 0.043965938366959736], ["member", 0.04350728859646699], ["master", 0.04175557632570269], ["telephone", 0.04175557632570269], ["booth", 0.04175557632570269], ["street", 0.0388997305497833], ["game", 0.03770245196276255], ["pool", 0.036619381737713404], ["long", 0.035848854497331814], ["sort", 0.03472103986654106], ["stand", 0.03472103986654106], ["rumfoord", 0.03422120069370762], ["lost", 0.033094893916078866], ["play", 0.0316725854734197], ["hell", 0.02927134577265599], ["malachi", 0.029013532815078777], ["blue", 0.026844367360178045], ["solar", 0.026844367360178045], ["find", 0.025218221409715847], ["wasn", 0.024484829124061632], ["system", 0.022835033557646885], ["knew", 0.022531985295349596], ["constant", 0.020295751068291127], ["thing", 0.01715371592663453], ["head", 0.01678711521960929], ["space", 0.010453642044599249]], "sentiment": ["\"What else would there be but static!\" said Beatrice. \"I\u2019m going to be thrown right out in the street, without even the price of a meal\u2014and my husband laughs and wants me to play guessing games!\"\n\"It wasn\u2019t any ordinary guessing game,\" said Rumfoord. \"It was about how long the human race was going to last.

incidentally, was a two-fer. He named his party the National Socialists, the Nazis. Hitler also had crosses painted on his tanks and airplanes. The swastika wasn\u2019t a pagan symbol, as so many people believe. It was a working person\u2019s Christian cross, made of axes, of tools.\nAbout Stalin\u2019s shuttered churches, and those in China today: Such suppression of religion was supposedly justified by Karl Marx\u2019s statement that \u201cReligion is the opium of the people.\u201d Marx said that back in 1844, when opium and opium derivatives were the only effective pain killers anyone could take. Marx himself had taken them. He was grateful for the temporary relief they had given him. He was simply noticing, and surely not condemning, the fact that religion could also be comforting to those in economic or social distress. It was a casual truism, not a dictum.\nWhen Marx wrote those words, by the way, we hadn\u2019t even freed our slaves yet. Whom do you imagine was more pleasing in the eyes of a merciful God back then? Karl Marx or the United States of America?\nStalin was happy to take Marx\u2019s truism as a decree, and Chinese tyrants as well, since it seemingly empowered them to put preachers out of business who might speak ill of them or their goals.\nThe statement has also entitled many in this country to say that socialists are anti-religion, are anti-God, and therefore absolutely loathsome.\nI never met Carl Sandburg, and wish I had. I would have been tongue-tied in the presence of such a national treasure. I did get to know one socialist of his generation, who was Powers Hapgood of Indianapolis. After graduating from Harvard, he went to work as a coal miner, urging his working-class brothers to organize, in order to get better pay and safer working conditions. He also led protesters at the execution of the anarchists Nicolo Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti in Massachusetts in 1927.\nAnother of our freshwater ancestors was Eugene Victor Debs, of Terre Haute, Indiana. A former locomotive fireman, Eugene Debs ran for President of the United States four times, the fourth time in 1920, when he was in prison. He said, \u201cAs long as there is a lower class, I\u2019m in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I\u2019m of it. As long as there\u2019s a soul in prison, I am not free.\u201d Some platform.\nA paraphrase of the Beatitudes.\nAnd again: Hooray for our team.\nAnd our own beloved Carl Sandburg had this to say about the fire-belching evangelist Billy Sunday:", 0.12444444444444448], "title": "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["diving", 0.11106628141225793], ["lie", 0.07974720719987372], ["zenji", 0.07823757912619915], ["bothering", 0.07404418760817194], ["burning", 0.07404418760817194], ["meter", 0.0672864358063692], ["mandarax", 0.049356446602868094], ["fourteen", 0.048976230995234044], ["craziness", 0.042798320308752184], ["treasure", 0.042798320308752184], ["idiomatic", 0.042798320308752184], ["volatility", 0.042798320308752184], ["conversing", 0.042798320308752184], ["forgot", 0.042798320308752184], ["helplessness", 0.042798320308752184], ["unintentionally", 0.042798320308752184], ["nervously", 0.042798320308752184], ["inwardly", 0.042798320308752184], ["galleon", 0.042798320308752184], ["goddess", 0.042798320308752184], ["ankle", 0.042798320308752184], ["vowing", 0.042798320308752184], ["midst", 0.042798320308752184], ["attached", 0.042798320308752184], ["emotional", 0.042798320308752184], ["scuba", 0.042798320308752184], ["cannonballs", 0.042798320308752184], ["sunken", 0.042798320308752184], ["wrist", 0.042798320308752184], ["dishes", 0.042798320308752184], ["employed", 0.03702209380408597], ["cursing", 0.03702209380408597], ["toying", 0.03702209380408597], ["translating", 0.03702209380408597], ["navaho", 0.03702209380408597], ["unborn", 0.03702209380408597], ["yacht", 0.03702209380408597], ["macintosh", 0.03555565925864885], ["daughter", 0.03485459998878064], ["yucat", 0.0336432179031846], ["accidentally", 0.0336432179031846], ["silence", 0.0336432179031846], ["scarcely", 0.0336432179031846], ["omoo", 0.03124586729941976], ["weight", 0.03124586729941976], ["broken", 0.03124586729941976], ["passing", 0.03124586729941976], ["mess", 0.03124586729941976], ["cord", 0.02938633770513468], ["nylon", 0.02938633770513468], ["spit", 0.02938633770513468], ["general", 0.02938633770513468], ["spend", 0.02938633770513468], ["bringing", 0.02786699139851839], ["personal", 0.02546964079475355], ["forty", 0.02546964079475355], ["raise", 0.02546964079475355], ["swim", 0.02546964079475355], ["week", 0.02546964079475355], ["hisako", 0.0249702046220646], ["die", 0.024488115497617022], ["truth", 0.024488115497617022], ["playing", 0.024488115497617022], ["easy", 0.023610111200468468], ["telling", 0.023610111200468468], ["computer", 0.023610111200468468], ["stay", 0.023610111200468468], ["heads", 0.023610111200468468], ["meters", 0.02281585970209909], ["guess", 0.02209076489385218], ["spanish", 0.02142374232990604], ["child", 0.020231235299567097], ["english", 0.020231235299567097], ["meant", 0.019693414290087335], ["set", 0.019693414290087335], ["afternoon", 0.019693414290087335], ["japanese", 0.019188209108283717], ["animals", 0.019188209108283717], ["turn", 0.018711888992950808], ["hand", 0.018711888992950808], ["american", 0.018261328815698512], ["supposed", 0.017039633197432884], ["dead", 0.016669201842675938], ["second", 0.016669201842675938], ["blind", 0.016669201842675938], ["incidentally", 0.016314538389185968], ["head", 0.015333013092049439], ["story", 0.015029949390625482], ["years", 0.014812591369506446], ["three", 0.013660757296531512], ["selena", 0.0131704197963404], ["brains", 0.012935662488284597], ["thing", 0.012057658191136045], ["ago", 0.010033106702716134], ["long", 0.00987128932057362], ["human", 0.0070444916325155885], ["big", 0.006819252695949594], ["time", 0.005393017227651016]], "sentiment": ["In one second *Zenji was inwardly cursing her for her helplessness, for being such a dead weight, and in the next he was vowing in his head to die, if necessary, for this goddess and her unborn daughter.\nOf what possible use was such emotional volatility, not to say craziness, in the heads of animals who were supposed to stay together long enough, at least, to raise a human child, which took about fourteen years or so?\n*Zenji found himself saying in the midst of a silence, \u201cSomething else is bothering you.\u201d He meant that something more personal than the general mess they were in was burning her up, and had been burning her up for quite some time.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said.

But maybe you can explain to me why Mr. Gregorian, who thinks so highly of you, hasn\u2019t signed at least one of them, and perhaps scribbled a little note of encouragement to my gifted son?\u201d\nAll this was said in Armenian. He never talked anything but Armenian at home after the failure of El Banco Busto.\nWhether the advice and encourgement had come from Gregory or Marilee didn\u2019t matter much to me at that point. If I do say so myself, I had become one hell of a good artist for a kid in any case. I was so conceited about my prospects, with or without help from New York City, that I defended Marilee mainly to cheer up Father.\n\u201cIf this Marilee, whoever she is, whatever she is, thinks so much of your pictures,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t she sell some of them and send you the money?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s been extremely generous,\u201d I replied\u2014and so she had been: generous with her time, but also with the finest artist\u2019s materials then available anywhere. I had no idea of their value, and neither did she. She had taken them without permission from the supply room in the basement of Gregory\u2019s mansion. I myself would see that room in a couple of years, and there was enough stuff in there to take care of Gregory\u2019s needs, as prolific as he was, for a dozen lifetimes. She didn\u2019t think he would miss what she sent me, and she didn\u2019t ask permission because she was scared to death of him.\nHe used to hit and kick her a lot.\nBut about the actual value of the stuff: the paints I was using sure weren\u2019t Sateen Dura-Luxe. They were Mussini oils and Horadam watercolors from Germany. My brushes came from Winsor and Newton in England. My pastels and colored pencils and inks came from Le-f\u00e9bvre-Foinet in Paris. My canvas came from Claessen\u2019s in Belgium. No other artist west of the Rockies had such priceless art supplies!\nFor that matter, Dan Gregory was the only illustrator I ever knew who expected his pictures to take their places among the great art treasures of the world, who used materials which might really do what Sateen Dura-Luxe was supposed to do: outlast the smile on the \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d The rest of them were satisfied if their work survived the trip to the print shop. They commonly sneered that they did such hack work only for money, that it was art for people who didn\u2019t know anything about art\u2014but not Dan Gregory.\n\u201cShe is using you,\u201d said my

some are born blind or whatever, and this book is about congenitally defective human beings of a sort that is making this whole country and many other parts of the planet go completely haywire nowadays. These were people born without consciences, and suddenly they are taking charge of everything.\nPPs are presentable, they know full well the suffering their actions may cause others, but they do not care. They cannot care because they are nuts. They have a screw loose!\nAnd what syndrome better describes so many executives at Enron and WorldCom and on and on, who have enriched themselves while ruining their employees and investors and country and who still feel as pure as the driven snow, no matter what anybody may say to or about them? And they are waging a war that is making billionaires out of millionaires, and trillionaires out of billionaires, and they own television, and they bankroll George Bush, and not because he\u2019s against gay marriage.\nSo many of these heartless PPs now hold big jobs in our federal government, as though they were leaders instead of sick. They have taken charge. They have taken charge of communications and the schools, so we might as well be Poland under occupation.\nThey might have felt that taking our country into an endless war was simply something decisive to do. What has allowed so many PPs to rise so high in corporations, and now in government, is that they are so decisive. They are going to do something every fuckin\u2019 day and they are not afraid. Unlike normal people, they are never filled with doubts, for the simple reason that they don\u2019t give a fuck what happens next. Simply can\u2019t. Do this! Do that! Mobilize the reserves! Privatize the public schools! Attack Iraq! Cut health care! Tap everybody\u2019s telephone! Cut taxes on the rich! Build a trillion-dollar missile shield! Fuck habeas corpus and the Sierra Club and In These Times, and kiss my ass!\nThere is a tragic flaw in our precious Constitution, and I don\u2019t know what can be done to fix it. This is it: Only nut cases want to be president. This was true even in high school. Only clearly disturbed people ran for class president.\nThe title of Michael Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9/11 is a parody of the title of Ray Bradbury\u2019s great science-fiction novel Fahrenheit 451. Four hundred and fifty-one degrees Fahrenheit is the combustion point, incidentally, of paper, of which books are composed. The hero of Bradbury\u2019s novel is a municipal worker whose job is burning books.\nWhile on the subject of burning books, I want to congratulate librarians, not famous for their physical strength, their powerful political connections or great wealth, who, all over this country, have staunchly resisted anti-democratic bullies who have tried to remove certain books from their shelves, and destroyed records rather than have to reveal to thought police the names of persons who have checked out those titles.\nSo the America I loved still exists, if not in the White House, the Supreme Court, the Senate, the House of Representatives, or the media. The America I loved still exists at the front desks of our public libraries.\nAnd still on the subject of books: Our daily news sources, newspapers and TV, are now so craven, so unvigilant on behalf of the American people, so uninformative, that only in books do we learn what\u2019s really going on.", 0.11649823093573095], "title": "A Man without a Country"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["architect", 0.11128612391538625], ["sentimental", 0.10715039404890886], ["sun", 0.10399385099662123], ["cornell", 0.06052748354298597], ["horses", 0.05733574699114439], ["artillery", 0.05357519702445443], ["stayed", 0.05357519702445443], ["horse", 0.05065828785694843], ["dogs", 0.05065828785694843], ["drawn", 0.04827499953284445], ["card", 0.04827499953284445], ["invited", 0.04625995796647506], ["send", 0.04625995796647506], ["daily", 0.04625995796647506], ["caissons", 0.035848345970527155], ["raiding", 0.035848345970527155], ["cubes", 0.035848345970527155], ["dailies", 0.035848345970527155], ["eleventh", 0.035848345970527155], ["rode", 0.035848345970527155], ["frighten", 0.035848345970527155], ["elwyn", 0.035848345970527155], ["chemistry", 0.035453702107854555], ["father", 0.03247363798042275], ["staff", 0.03131797224137719], ["sorrow", 0.03131797224137719], ["urged", 0.03131797224137719], ["alumnus", 0.03131797224137719], ["1981", 0.03131797224137719], ["indians", 0.03131797224137719], ["doddering", 0.03131797224137719], ["saddles", 0.03131797224137719], ["corporation", 0.03131797224137719], ["ithaca", 0.028667873495572194], ["marry", 0.028667873495572194], ["1921", 0.028667873495572194], ["hooked", 0.028667873495572194], ["richest", 0.028667873495572194], ["brooks", 0.028667873495572194], ["entered", 0.028667873495572194], ["anger", 0.028667873495572194], ["faithful", 0.028667873495572194], ["pretended", 0.028667873495572194], ["1940", 0.026787598512227215], ["qualified", 0.026787598512227215], ["architecture", 0.026787598512227215], ["ice", 0.026787598512227215], ["persuaded", 0.026787598512227215], ["echo", 0.026787598512227215], ["editor", 0.026787598512227215], ["july", 0.026787598512227215], ["hider", 0.026787598512227215], ["chemist", 0.026787598512227215], ["banquet", 0.025329143928474216], ["3", 0.025329143928474216], ["november", 0.025329143928474216], ["annual", 0.025329143928474216], ["bell", 0.025329143928474216], ["distinguished", 0.025329143928474216], ["separate", 0.025329143928474216], ["year", 0.025221553882369168], ["high", 0.02485330712463458], ["university", 0.024495150599299746], ["school", 0.024146546062278028], ["unhappy", 0.024137499766422224], ["drinks", 0.024137499766422224], ["speaker", 0.024137499766422224], ["running", 0.024137499766422224], ["afternoon", 0.02312997898323753], ["1980", 0.02312997898323753], ["shortridge", 0.02312997898323753], ["student", 0.022257224783077248], ["evening", 0.021487401020617226], ["indianapolis", 0.021367965121314985], ["easily", 0.020798770199324246], ["studied", 0.020798770199324246], ["occasion", 0.020798770199324246], ["study", 0.02017582784766199], ["clear", 0.02017582784766199], ["generation", 0.019607126037272254], ["fellow", 0.019607126037272254], ["suppose", 0.019607126037272254], ["poor", 0.019083971085157636], ["depression", 0.018599605254087558], ["will", 0.01846082649452257], ["entirely", 0.018148671453519248], ["older", 0.018148671453519248], ["third", 0.01733061169564993], ["published", 0.016957027291467256], ["town", 0.016957027291467256], ["brother", 0.016603646760288984], ["americans", 0.016268396470174275], ["living", 0.015949506508282564], ["white", 0.015645454118512023], ["place", 0.015354919722624219], ["mind", 0.015354919722624219], ["surely", 0.015076752308122285], ["married", 0.01480994188642127], ["full", 0.014553597356007664], ["speak", 0.014553597356007664], ["women", 0.014553597356007664], ["knew", 0.014306928545662262], ["fifty", 0.012995355372707025], ["country", 0.01242665356231729], ["class", 0.01190349861020267], ["writer", 0.011738022741024305], ["york", 0.010968198978564282], ["course", 0.010683982560657493], ["told", 0.010683982560657493], ["work", 0.010150139220694963], ["things", 0.009898725620513289], ["children", 0.00942317428533402], ["great", 0.00930950276434141], ["book", 0.00908792399521931], ["man", 0.00908792399521931], ["war", 0.008769034033327596], ["time", 0.008068790627909446], ["years", 0.0068887590499826235], ["good", 0.006223512681943785]], "sentiment": ["I might have stayed if I had done what my father had done, which was to marry one of the richest women in town. But I married a poor one instead. I might have stayed if my father had not told me this: be anything but an architect. He and my older brother, who had become a chemist, urged me to study chemistry instead. I would have liked to be an architect, and an architect in Indianapolis at that. I would have become a third-generation Indianapolis architect. There can\u2019t be very many of those around.\nBut Father was so full of anger and sorrow about having had no work as an architect during the Great Depression that he persuaded me that I, too, would be that unhappy if I studied architecture.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo I entered Cornell University in 1940 as a chemistry student. I had in high school been an editor of The Shortridge Daily Echo, one of two high school dailies in the country at the time, so I also qualified easily for the staff of The Cornell Daily Sun.\nThe children now running the Sun invited me to speak at their annual banquet in Ithaca, New York, on May 3, 1980. The Sun, by the way, a corporation entirely separate from the university, will be one hundred years old when this book is published\u2014in 1981.\nThis doddering alumnus, who drinks no more, had this to say above the raiding of the ice cubes:\n\u201cGood evening, fellow Americans.\n\u201cYou should have invited a more sentimental speaker, I think. This is surely a sentimental occasion, and I am sentimental about faithful dogs sometimes, but that is as far as it goes.\n\u201cThe most distinguished living writer who was also a Sun man is, of course, Elwyn Brooks White of the class of 1921. He will be eighty-one on July eleventh of this year. You might want to send him a card. His mind is as clear as a bell, and he is not only sentimental about dogs but about Cornell.\n\u201cI myself liked only two things about this place: the Sun and the horse-drawn artillery. Yes\u2014there was horse-drawn artillery here in my time. I suppose I should tell you how old I am, too. I will be fifty-eight in November of this year. You might want to send me a card, too.

Finally she said, in a very tough, twangy voice, \u201cWho is this? Is this somebody trying to blackmail me? Because if it is, you can go straight to hell. Go ahead and give the whole story to the newspapers, if you want to. I\u2019ve never tried to keep it a secret. I was married when I was sixteen to a boy named Harry Barker. We were both juniors in high school, and we had to get married on account of I was going to have a baby. Tell the whole wide world, for all I care.\u201d And then Harry said, \u201cThe baby died, Melody Arlene. Your little baby died two years after you walked out.\u201d\nQ: He said what?\nA: His and her baby died. Their baby died. She didn\u2019t even know it, never bothered to find out what became of her daughter. This, according to Male Valor magazine, was woman eternal, every red-blooded male\u2019s dream girl. And you know what she said?\nQ: No.\nA: Sergeant, this Woman Eternal for October said, \u201cThat\u2019s a part of my life I\u2019ve blotted out completely. I\u2019m sorry, but I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d\nQ: What was Verne Petrie\u2019s reaction when she said that?\nA: No special reaction. His piggy little eyes were all glazed over, and he was showing his teeth and kind of gnashing them. He was off in some wild daydream about himself and Patty Lee Minot.\nQ: And then what?", 0.034227680532028355], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["read", 0.09706615039387728], ["intelligence", 0.0817419567342549], ["write", 0.07952977846100946], ["achievements", 0.07915380459789666], ["candlelight", 0.07915380459789666], ["babble", 0.07915380459789666], ["drool", 0.07915380459789666], ["latin", 0.07915380459789666], ["itch", 0.07915380459789666], ["naptime", 0.07915380459789666], ["french", 0.07915380459789666], ["freakishness", 0.07915380459789666], ["comply", 0.07915380459789666], ["calculus", 0.07915380459789666], ["display", 0.07915380459789666], ["italian", 0.07915380459789666], ["begged", 0.0688083242910318], ["vile", 0.0688083242910318], ["trained", 0.0688083242910318], ["helpless", 0.0688083242910318], ["secretly", 0.0688083242910318], ["extra", 0.0688083242910318], ["advancement", 0.0688083242910318], ["attractive", 0.0688083242910318], ["ladder", 0.0688083242910318], ["toes", 0.0688083242910318], ["greek", 0.0688083242910318], ["bedtime", 0.06275660625956665], ["nipples", 0.06275660625956665], ["grownups", 0.06275660625956665], ["hearts", 0.06275660625956665], ["toilet", 0.058462843984166936], ["german", 0.058462843984166936], ["hoped", 0.058462843984166936], ["fingers", 0.05513234321828321], ["thousands", 0.05513234321828321], ["knowing", 0.05513234321828321], ["fun", 0.05513234321828321], ["continued", 0.05513234321828321], ["passageways", 0.0524111259527018], ["english", 0.0524111259527018], ["ancient", 0.05011036953736959], ["glad", 0.05011036953736959], ["time", 0.04852823296490906], ["ten", 0.048117363677302086], ["example", 0.048117363677302086], ["books", 0.044786862911418354], ["public", 0.044786862911418354], ["elihu", 0.044786862911418354], ["roosevelt", 0.044786862911418354], ["small", 0.044786862911418354], ["mausoleum", 0.04336432291433888], ["wished", 0.042065645645836945], ["simply", 0.03976488923050473], ["secret", 0.03777188337043723], ["times", 0.035206954162576645], ["mansion", 0.03371317119903959], ["human", 0.03301884260747403], ["thought", 0.029962209582906664], ["day", 0.02608890815775615], ["swain", 0.022009903157760906]], "sentiment": ["So, from the very first, and without quite knowing what they were doing, I am sure, they begged us a thousand times a day to go on being helpless and vile.\nThere was only one small advancement they wished us to make up the ladder of human achievements.

It was soon after I came to work for him\u2014in the spring of Nineteen-hundred and Seventy. I was summoned to an emergency meeting about the shooting to death of four antiwar protesters at Kent State University by members of the Ohio National Guard. There were about forty other people at the meeting. President Nixon was at the head of the huge oval table, and I was at the foot. This was the first time I had seen him in person since he was a mere congressman\u2014twenty years before. Until now he had no wish to see his special advisor on youth affairs. As things turned out, he would never want to see me again.\nVirgil Greathouse, the secretary of health, education, and welfare, and reputedly one of the President\u2019s closest friends, was there. He would begin serving his prison term on the same day I completed mine. Vice-President Spiro T. Agnew was there. He would eventually plead nolo contendere to charges of accepting bribes and evading income taxes. Emil Larkin, the President\u2019s most vindictive advisor and dreaded hatchet man, was there. He would eventually discover Jesus Christ as his personal Savior as the prosecutors were about to get him for obstruction of justice and perjury. Henry Kissinger was there. He had yet to recommend the carpet-bombing of Hanoi on Christmas Day. Richard M. Helms, head of the C.I.A., was there. He would later be reprimanded for lying under oath of Congress. H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman and Charles W. Colson and John N. Mitchell, the attorney general, were there. They, too, would be jailbirds by and by.\nI had been up all the previous night, drafting and redrafting my suggestions as to what the President might say about the Kent State tragedy. The guardsmen, I thought, should be pardoned at once, and then reprimanded, and then discharged for the good of the service. The President should then order an investigation of National Guard units everywhere, to discover if such civilians in soldiers\u2019 costumes were in fact to be trusted with live ammunition when controlling unarmed crowds. The President should call the tragedy a tragedy, should reveal himself as having had his heart broken. He should declare a day or perhaps a week of national mourning, with flags flown at half-mast everywhere. And the mourning should not be just for those who died at Kent State, but for all Americans who had been killed or crippled in any way, directly or indirectly, by the Vietnam War. He would be more deeply resolved than ever, of course, to press the war to an honorable conclusion.\nBut I was never asked to speak, nor afterward could I interest anyone in the papers in my hand.\nMy presence was acknowledged only once, and then only as the butt of a joke by the President. I was so nervous as the meeting wore on that I soon had three cigarettes going all at once, and was in the process of lighting the fourth.\nThe President himself at last noticed the column of smoke rising from my place, and he stopped all business to stare at me. He had to ask Emil Larkin who I was.\nHe then gave that unhappy little smile that invariably signaled that he was about to engage in levity. That smile has always looked to me like a rosebud that had just been smashed by a hammer. The joke he made was the only genuinely witty comment I ever heard attributed to him. Perhaps that is my proper place in history\u2014as the butt of the one good joke by Nixon.\n\u201cWe will pause in our business,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile our special advisor on youth affairs gives us a demonstration of how to put out a campfire.\u201d\nThere was laughter all around.\n4", 0.1053588338744589], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["pefko", 0.20070105943721112], ["dunno", 0.13992687182764083], ["breed", 0.10226761680392635], ["dr", 0.09978532909998714], ["type", 0.09328458121842723], ["scientists", 0.06690035314573704], ["fat", 0.06391147516550828], ["thinking", 0.05002134630670167], ["costume", 0.04664229060921361], ["crimson", 0.04664229060921361], ["friendliness", 0.04664229060921361], ["helpless", 0.04664229060921361], ["jewelry", 0.04664229060921361], ["ech", 0.04664229060921361], ["kleenex", 0.04664229060921361], ["reproach", 0.04664229060921361], ["language", 0.04664229060921361], ["chickenlike", 0.04664229060921361], ["winded", 0.04664229060921361], ["rumbled", 0.04664229060921361], ["gurgled", 0.04664229060921361], ["ransacking", 0.04664229060921361], ["flap", 0.04664229060921361], ["chatting", 0.04664229060921361], ["gait", 0.04664229060921361], ["expansively", 0.04664229060921361], ["coveralls", 0.04664229060921361], ["trudged", 0.04664229060921361], ["defeated", 0.04664229060921361], ["dictation", 0.04664229060921361], ["slackly", 0.04664229060921361], ["responsible", 0.04664229060921361], ["finding", 0.04664229060921361], ["fuse", 0.04664229060921361], ["filthy", 0.04664229060921361], ["idiotically", 0.04664229060921361], ["upside", 0.04664229060921361], ["woman", 0.045015089756682294], ["understand", 0.043374377321321926], ["blown", 0.04096075634232881], ["glassy", 0.04096075634232881], ["nervous", 0.04096075634232881], ["hearing", 0.04096075634232881], ["emptily", 0.04096075634232881], ["spot", 0.04096075634232881], ["struck", 0.03763727184963894], ["foreign", 0.03763727184963894], ["amount", 0.03763727184963894], ["expression", 0.03763727184963894], ["embarrassed", 0.03763727184963894], ["appropriate", 0.03763727184963894], ["blurted", 0.03763727184963894], ["examine", 0.03763727184963894], ["horvath", 0.03763727184963894], ["implied", 0.03763727184963894], ["representative", 0.03763727184963894], ["stiff", 0.03527922207544402], ["apologized", 0.03527922207544402], ["asks", 0.03527922207544402], ["system", 0.03527922207544402], ["atom", 0.03527922207544402], ["college", 0.03345017657286852], ["inside", 0.03195573758275414], ["turn", 0.030692207420235634], ["laughed", 0.030692207420235634], ["things", 0.029822269564199498], ["longer", 0.029597687808559217], ["hated", 0.028632253090064272], ["crazy", 0.028632253090064272], ["smile", 0.027768642305983728], ["lips", 0.027768642305983728], ["simply", 0.027768642305983728], ["mankind", 0.027768642305983728], ["god", 0.02729520923916248], ["school", 0.026987411323981067], ["moment", 0.026274203315869347], ["shook", 0.02561811554805347], ["talking", 0.02561811554805347], ["question", 0.024445157813293854], ["bomb", 0.022950718823179474], ["happened", 0.022950718823179474], ["year", 0.022950718823179474], ["mind", 0.022950718823179474], ["tells", 0.022950718823179474], ["mother", 0.02208710803909893], ["find", 0.02094151834749927], ["turned", 0.02094151834749927], ["people", 0.020454232751372852], ["long", 0.019936581281168677], ["work", 0.0196272343304896], ["head", 0.019329138886466035], ["thought", 0.017737696145146715], ["wasn", 0.016203175308358627], ["day", 0.015083703709950836], ["going", 0.014576528269638643]], "sentiment": ["\u201cGod,\u201d she said, \u201cdon\u2019t ask me.

"sentiment": ["Baer waved and called to them in his high-pitched voice. Kroner nodded almost imperceptibly, and stood perfectly still, not looking directly at them, waiting for them to come up so that greetings could be exchanged quietly and with dignity.\nKroner\u2019s enormous, hairy hand closed about Paul\u2019s, and Paul, in spite of himself, felt docile, and loving, and childlike. It was as though Paul stood in the enervating, emasculating presence of his father again. Kroner, his father\u2019s closest friend, had always made him feel that way, and seemingly wanted to make him feel that way. Paul had sworn a thousand times to keep his wits about him the next time he met Kroner. But it was a matter beyond his control, and at each meeting, as now, the power and resolve were all in the big hands of the older man.\nThough Paul was especially aware of the paternal aura about Kroner, the big man tried to make the feeling general. He spoke of himself as father to all of the men under him, and more vaguely, to their wives; and it was no pose. His administration of the Eastern Division had an emotional flavor about it, and it seemed unlikely that he could have run the Division any other way. He was cognizant of every birth or major illness, and heaped blame on himself in the rare instances that any of his men went wrong. He could also be stern\u2014again, paternally.\n\u201cHow are you, Paul?\u201d he said warmly. The quizzical set of his thick eyebrows indicated that this was a question, not a salutation. The tone was one Kroner used when inquiring into someone\u2019s condition after a siege of pneumonia or worse.\n\u201cHe\u2019s never been better,\u201d said Anita briskly.\n\u201cGlad to hear it. That\u2019s fine, Paul.\u201d Kroner continued to hold onto his hand and to stare into his eyes.\n\u201cFeel good, do you, eh? Good? Good, eh? Wonderful,\u201d said Baer, clapping him on the shoulder several times. \u201cWonderful.\u201d Baer, the Eastern Division\u2019s chief engineer, turned to Anita. \u201cAnd, oh my! Don\u2019t you look nice. My, yes. Oh! I should say so.\u201d He grinned.\nBaer was a social cretin, apparently unaware that he was anything but suave and brilliant in company. Someone had once mentioned his running commentary on conversations to him, and he hadn\u2019t known what they were talking about. Technically, there wasn\u2019t a better engineer in the East, including Finnerty. There was little in the Division that hadn\u2019t been master-minded by Baer, who here seemed to Kroner what a fox terrier seems to a St. Bernard. Paul had thought often of the peculiar combination of Kroner and Baer, and wondered if, when they were gone, higher management could possibly duplicate it. Baer embodied the knowledge and technique of industry; Kroner personified the faith, the near-holiness, the spirit of the complicated venture. Kroner, in fact, had a poor record as an engineer and had surprised Paul from time to time with his ignorance or misunderstanding of technical matters; but he had the priceless quality of believing in the system, and of making others believe in it, too, and do as they were told.\nThe two were inseparable, though their personalities met at almost no point. Together, they made an approximately whole man.\n\u201cDid someone tell you Paul had been sick?\u201d said Anita, laughing.", 0.14583333333333331], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["book", 0.17467209521041688], ["storm", 0.10338886452192515], ["met", 0.09957368187551022], ["raw", 0.09278806146214759], ["pajamas", 0.09278806146214759], ["crocker", 0.09278806146214759], ["bathrobe", 0.0850649165458016], ["windows", 0.08358465936306957], ["falls", 0.07958525802291054], ["miles", 0.07958525802291054], ["read", 0.07485946937589294], ["lived", 0.06892590968128344], ["week", 0.06892590968128344], ["wrote", 0.06638245458367348], ["hadn", 0.05440895630896159], ["outstanding", 0.052995432450692326], ["rawest", 0.052995432450692326], ["boston", 0.052995432450692326], ["haters", 0.052995432450692326], ["screens", 0.052995432450692326], ["farmhouse", 0.046394030731073795], ["generally", 0.046394030731073795], ["sales", 0.046394030731073795], ["south", 0.046394030731073795], ["noticing", 0.046394030731073795], ["combination", 0.046394030731073795], ["sold", 0.046394030731073795], ["vermont", 0.046394030731073795], ["aluminum", 0.046394030731073795], ["husband", 0.04626716555035323], ["hypocrites", 0.0425324582729008], ["unpleasant", 0.0425324582729008], ["junction", 0.0425324582729008], ["wild", 0.03979262901145527], ["shaved", 0.03979262901145527], ["lover", 0.03979262901145527], ["popular", 0.03979262901145527], ["lance", 0.03766745233227232], ["magnum", 0.03766745233227232], ["knocked", 0.03593105655328227], ["teacher", 0.03593105655328227], ["answered", 0.03593105655328227], ["works", 0.03593105655328227], ["sell", 0.03446295484064172], ["huge", 0.03446295484064172], ["meeting", 0.03446295484064172], ["paid", 0.03446295484064172], ["house", 0.03434895793579298], ["elsie", 0.03319122729183674], ["strang", 0.03319122729183674], ["morgan", 0.03319122729183674], ["books", 0.032069484095109284], ["woman", 0.03147614098846757], ["expect", 0.030158334614517366], ["attention", 0.030158334614517366], ["months", 0.029329654833663746], ["beautiful", 0.028567343332011018], ["question", 0.027204478154480793], ["people", 0.02707401297011735], ["idea", 0.024953156458630985], ["days", 0.024953156458630985], ["school", 0.023133582775176614], ["guess", 0.02272825311404522], ["young", 0.021965941612392494], ["couldn", 0.020925948355583045], ["high", 0.020290792407976644], ["talk", 0.019988423852599684], ["help", 0.019411046501966976], ["heard", 0.019411046501966976], ["great", 0.019134974722221712], ["asked", 0.019134974722221712], ["door", 0.015364539892773962], ["big", 0.01500510819769923], ["eyes", 0.01449018228083946], ["looked", 0.012265278936253699], ["time", 0.01102667771484229], ["man", 0.009041903718870802]], "sentiment": ["I read it. I guess everybody in Vermont read it when they heard Hypocrites\u2019 Junction was actually Crocker\u2019s Falls.\nI didn\u2019t think it was such a raw book, the way raw books go these days. It was just the rawest book a woman ever wrote\u2014and I expect that\u2019s why it was so popular.\nI met that woman once, that Elsie Strang Morgan, the one who wrote the book. I met her husband, the high school teacher, too. I sold them some combination aluminum storm windows and screens one time. That was about two months after the book came out. I hadn\u2019t read it yet, hadn\u2019t paid much attention to all the talk about it.\nThey lived in a huge, run-down old farmhouse five miles outside of Crocker\u2019s Falls back then, just five miles away from all those people she gave the works to in the book. I don\u2019t generally sell that far south, don\u2019t know many people down that way. I was on my way home from a sales meeting in Boston, and I saw that big house with no storm windows, and I just had to stop in.\nI didn\u2019t have the least idea whose house it was.\nI knocked on the door, and a young man in pajamas and a bathrobe answered. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d shaved in a week. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d been out of the pajamas and bathrobe for a week, either. They had a very lived-in look. His eyes were wild.

["HIS MENTOR SAM Wakefield, the man who recruited him for West Point, had quit the Army a year earlier in order to speak out against the war. He had become President of Tarkington College through powerful family connections.\nThree years after that, Sam Wakefield would commit suicide. So there is another loser for you, even though he had been a Major General and then a College President. I think exhaustion got him. I say that not only because he seemed very tired all the time to me, but because his suicide note wasn\u2019t even original and didn\u2019t seem to have that much to do with him personally. It was word for word the same suicide note left way back in 1932, when I was a negative 8 years old, by another loser, George Eastman, inventor of the Kodak camera and founder of Eastman Kodak, now defunct, only 75 kilometers north of here.\nBoth notes said this and nothing more: \u201cMy work is done.\u201d\nIn Sam Wakefield\u2019s case, that completed work, if he didn\u2019t want to count the Vietnam War, consisted of 3 new buildings, which probably would have been built anyway, no matter who was Tarkington\u2019s President.\nI AM NOT writing this book for people below the age of 18, but I see no harm in telling young people to prepare for failure rather than success, since failure is the main thing that is going to happen to them.\nIn terms of basketball alone, almost everybody has to lose. A high percentage of the convicts in Athena, and now in this much smaller institution, devoted their childhood and youth to nothing but basketball and still got their brains knocked out in the early rounds of some darn fool tournament.\nLET ME SAY further to the chance young reader that I would probably have wrecked my body and been thrown out of the University of Michigan and died on Skid Row somewhere if I had not been subjected to the discipline of West Point. I am talking about my body now, and not my mind, and there is no better way for a young person to learn respect for his or now her bones and nerves and muscles than to accept an appointment to any one of the 3 major service academies.\nI entered the Point a young punk with bad posture and a sunken chest, and no history of sports participation, save for a few fights after dances where our band had played. When I graduated and received my commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Regular Army, and tossed my hat in the air, and bought a red Corvette with the back pay the Academy had put aside for me, my spine was as straight as a ramrod, my lungs were as capacious as the bellows of the forge of Vulcan, I was captain of the judo and wrestling teams, and I had not smoked any sort of cigarette or swallowed a drop of alcohol for 4 whole years! Nor was I sexually promiscuous anymore. I never felt better in my life.\nI can remember saying to my mother and father at graduation, \u201cCan this be me?\u201d\nThey were so proud of me, and I was so proud of me.", 0.07813248766737141], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["peckham", 0.3053307061130327], ["colonel", 0.27917779043559804], ["complement", 0.17707710354640485], ["normal", 0.14378582207161364], ["calls", 0.14378582207161364], ["aha", 0.13506818351246877], ["salesman", 0.13506818351246877], ["delahanty", 0.13506818351246877], ["lady", 0.13506818351246877], ["biggest", 0.12830625771506848], ["sign", 0.1227813620546456], ["hellbrunner", 0.11811012933260748], ["money", 0.11128552919993268], ["hurty", 0.11049454059682244], ["asked", 0.1101934985634067], ["simply", 0.1044136104313027], ["exactly", 0.09305926347853269], ["live", 0.08785167993530059], ["passed", 0.08785167993530059], ["state", 0.08629733768113239], ["point", 0.08077244202070952], ["air", 0.08077244202070952], ["days", 0.07205480346156465], ["knew", 0.06933928350127108], ["car", 0.06684721991833255], ["place", 0.06040596410064549], ["three", 0.05676522737815872]], "sentiment": ["\u201cTell me,\u201d said Mrs. Peckham. \u201cHow did Mr. Hurty make his money?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s the biggest used-car salesman in this part of the state.\u201d\n\u201cAha!\u201d said the Colonel. \u201cI knew it!

He was supposed to take part in a symposium out there entitled \u201cThe Future of the American Novel in the Age of McLuhan.\u201d He wished to say at that symposium, \u201cI don\u2019t know who McLuhan is, but I know what it\u2019s like to spend the night with a lot of other dirty old men in a movie theater in New York City. Could we talk about that?\u201d\nHe wished to say, too, \u201cDoes this McLuhan, whoever he is, have anything to say about the relationship between wide-open beavers and the sales of books?\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTrout had come down from Cohoes late that afternoon. He had since visited many pornography shops and a shirt store. He had bought two of his own books, Plague on Wheels and Now It Can Be Told, a magazine containing a short story of his, and a tuxedo shirt. The name of the magazine was Black Garterbelt. The tuxedo shirt had a cascade of ruffles down its bosom. On the shirt salesman\u2019s advice, Trout had also bought a packaged ensemble consisting of a cumberbund, a boutonni\u00e8re, and a bow tie. They were all the color of tangerines.\nThese goodies were all in his lap, along with a crackling brown paper parcel containing his tuxedo, six new pairs of jockey shorts, six new pairs of socks, his razor and a new toothbrush. Trout hadn\u2019t owned a toothbrush for years.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe jackets of Plague on Wheels and Now It Can Be Told both promised plenty of wide-open beavers inside. The picture on the cover of Now It Can Be Told, which was the book which would turn Dwayne Hoover into a homicidal maniac, showed a college professor being undressed by a group of naked sorority girls. A library tower could be seen through a window in the sorority house. It was daytime outside, and there was a clock in the tower. The clock looked like this:\nThe professor was stripped down to his candy-striped underwear shorts and his socks and garters and his mortarboard, which was a hat which looked like this:\nThere was absolutely nothing about a professor or a sorority or a university anywhere in the body of the book. The book was in the form of a long letter from the Creator of the Universe to the only creature in the Universe who had free will.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.020481601731601733], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["nineteen", 0.09852813100984671], ["flares", 0.0931501866062724], ["eighteen", 0.08881093602956928], ["ain", 0.08073929654591235], ["talking", 0.07389609825738504], ["captain", 0.06313881823105279], ["hollered", 0.062100124404181604], ["fight", 0.058723799278367635], ["enlisted", 0.058723799278367635], ["everbody", 0.05586915705934433], ["fighting", 0.05586915705934433], ["peace", 0.049264065504923356], ["lick", 0.04595226509499913], ["rusting", 0.04595226509499913], ["tracers", 0.04595226509499913], ["nest", 0.04595226509499913], ["thickest", 0.04595226509499913], ["treaties", 0.04595226509499913], ["hint", 0.04595226509499913], ["conversation", 0.04595226509499913], ["daisy", 0.04595226509499913], ["ink", 0.039534235645370015], ["brothers", 0.039534235645370015], ["everthing", 0.039534235645370015], ["sunday", 0.039534235645370015], ["houses", 0.039534235645370015], ["fooling", 0.039534235645370015], ["freedom", 0.039534235645370015], ["flag", 0.039534235645370015], ["bird", 0.039534235645370015], ["faded", 0.039534235645370015], ["everwhere", 0.039534235645370015], ["win", 0.03577992908881294], ["land", 0.03577992908881294], ["bamboo", 0.03577992908881294], ["chicken", 0.03311620619574089], ["hanging", 0.03311620619574089], ["grand", 0.03311620619574089], ["wave", 0.03311620619574089], ["bullet", 0.03311620619574089], ["man", 0.03274041656504573], ["walking", 0.031050062202090802], ["rags", 0.031050062202090802], ["born", 0.031050062202090802], ["shell", 0.031050062202090802], ["running", 0.031050062202090802], ["forever", 0.031050062202090802], ["feeling", 0.031050062202090802], ["beam", 0.029361899639183817], ["standing", 0.027934578529672165], ["sense", 0.027934578529672165], ["edge", 0.027934578529672165], ["thought", 0.027154390162841237], ["machine", 0.02669817674611177], ["inside", 0.02669817674611177], ["hole", 0.025607593082626737], ["stopped", 0.025607593082626737], ["read", 0.023749531087606822], ["expect", 0.022943870189554693], ["started", 0.022943870189554693], ["bit", 0.022943870189554693], ["nice", 0.02220273400739232], ["supposed", 0.02220273400739232], ["wasn", 0.02182694437669715], ["crazy", 0.020877726195904604], ["air", 0.020877726195904604], ["won", 0.02028014729648265], ["smoke", 0.02028014729648265], ["good", 0.017360980361569592], ["hear", 0.017331501637977698], ["going", 0.017033210415284394], ["couldn", 0.01691991124380331], ["wanted", 0.01614785930918247], ["hell", 0.015435257076440539], ["years", 0.014773600002531789], ["men", 0.01445969674627548], ["looked", 0.013032375636763828], ["war", 0.012771534183368493], ["time", 0.008516605207642197]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI ain\u2019t talking about running,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about fighting!\u201d Oh, it was a crazy conversation.
