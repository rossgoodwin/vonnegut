I looked down. My lukewarm sea had swallowed all. A lazy curtain of dust was wafting out to sea, the only trace of all that fell.\nThe palace, its massive, seaward mask now gone, greeted the north with a leper\u2019s smile, snaggle-toothed and bristly. The bristles were the splintered ends of timbers. Immediately below me a large chamber had been laid open. The floor of that chamber, unsupported, stabbed out into space like a diving platform.\nI dreamed for a moment of dropping to the platform, of springing up from it in a breath-taking swan dive, of folding my arms, of knifing downward into a blood-warm eternity with never a splash.\nI was recalled from this dream by the cry of a darting bird above me. It seemed to be asking me what had happened. \u201cPootee-phweet?\u201d it asked.\nWe all looked up at the bird, and then at one another.\nWe backed away from the abyss, full of dread. And, when I stepped off the paving stone that had supported me, the stone began to rock. It was no more stable than a teeter-totter. And it tottered now over the diving platform.\nDown it crashed onto the platform, made the platform a chute. And down the chute came the furnishings still remaining in the room below.\nA xylophone shot out first, scampering fast on its tiny wheels. Out came a bedside table in a crazy race with a bounding blowtorch. Out came chairs in hot pursuit.\nAnd somewhere in that room below, out of sight, something mightily reluctant to move was beginning to move.\nDown the chute it crept. At last it showed its golden bow.

Reinbeck tonight.\u201d She nodded. \u201cSince we\u2019re calling spades spades tonight, we might as well call that one a spade, too. And just before we kissed up there on the golf course, I was thinking what a poor little rich boy he was, and how much happier I could make him than any old cold, stuck-up country club girl. And then he kissed me, and I knew he wasn\u2019t in love, couldn\u2019t ever be in love. So I made that kiss good-bye.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s where you made your mistake,\u201d said Turley.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Milly, \u201cbecause the next boy who kissed me kissed me right, showed me he knew what love was, even if there wasn\u2019t a moon. And I lived happily ever after, until tonight.\u201d She put her arms around Turley. \u201cNow kiss me again the way you kissed me the first time, and I\u2019ll be all right tonight, too.\u201d\nTurley did, so everything was all right there, too.\nAbout twenty minutes after that, the telephones in both houses rang. The burden of the messages was that Charlie Reinbeck and Nancy Whitman were fine. They had, however, put their own interpretation on the moonlight. They\u2019d decided that Cinderella and Prince Charming had as good a chance as anybody for really living happily ever after. So they\u2019d married.\nSo now there was a new household. Whether everything was all right there remained to be seen. The moon went down.\nFind Me\na Dream\nIf the Communists ever expect to overtake the democracies in sewer pipe production, they are certainly going to have to hump some\u2014because just one factory in Creon, Pennsylvania, produces more pipe in six months than both Russia and China put together could produce in a year.
