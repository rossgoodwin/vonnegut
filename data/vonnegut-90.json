To make the joke more immediate, Fred said it was Father who got the short straw. Father could cook. Mother couldn\u2019t. She was proud she couldn\u2019t cook, and wouldn\u2019t wash dishes and so on. I liked to go over to other kids\u2019 houses, where their mothers did those things.\nThe hunters agreed that anybody who complained about Father\u2019s cooking became the cook. So Father prepared worse and worse meals, while the others were having one hell of a good time in the forest. No matter how awful a supper was, though, the hunters pronounced it lip-smacking delicious, clapping Father on the back and so on.\nAfter they marched off one morning, Father found a pile of fresh moose poop outside. He fried it in motor oil. That night he served it as steaming patties.\nThe first guy to taste one spit it out. He couldn\u2019t help himself! He spluttered, \u201cJesus Christ! That tastes like moose poop fried in motor oil!\u201d\nBut then he added, \u201cBut good, but good!\u201d\nI think Mother was raised to be so useless because her father Albert Lieber, the brewer and speculator, believed that America was going to have an aristocracy based on the European model. Proofs of membership in such a caste over there, and so it would be over here, too, he must have reasoned, were wives and daughters who were ornamental.\n41\nI don\u2019t think I missed the boat when I failed to write a novel about Albert Lieber, and how he was largely responsible for my mother\u2019s suicide on Mother\u2019s Day Eve, 1944. German-Americans in Indianapolis lack universality. They have never been sympathetically, or even villainously, stereotyped in movies or books or plays. I would have had to explain them from scratch.\nLotsa luck!\nThe great critic H. L.

I knew he was dead. The detective agency I had hired to find word of Helga had told me that much\u2014that Werner Noth was dead.\nThe details of his death came to hand by chance\u2014in a Greenwich Village barber shop. I was leafing through a girly magazine, admiring the way women were made, and awaiting my turn for a haircut. The story advertised on the magazine cover was \u201cHang-women for the Hangman of Berlin.\u201d There was no reason for me to suppose that the article was about my father-in-law. Hanging hadn\u2019t been his business. I turned to the article.\nAnd I looked for quite a while at a murky photograph of Werner Noth being hanged from an apple tree without suspecting who the hanged man was. I looked at the faces of the people at the hanging. They were mostly women, nameless, shapeless ragbags.\nAnd I played a game, counting the ways in which the magazine cover had lied. For one thing, the women weren\u2019t doing the hanging. Three scrawny men in rags were doing it. For another thing, the women in the photograph weren\u2019t beautiful, and the hangwomen on the cover were. The hangwomen on the cover had breasts like cantaloupes, hips like horse collars, and their rags were the pathetic remains of nightgowns by Schiaparelli. The women in the photograph were as pretty as catfish wrapped in mattress-ticking.\nAnd then, just before I began to read the story of the hanging, I began, tentatively and queasily, to recognize the shattered building in the background. Behind the hangman, looking like a mouthful of broken teeth, was all that was left of the home of Werner Noth, of the home where my Helga had been raised as a good German citizen, of the home where I had said farewell to a ten-year-old nihilist named Resi.\nI read the text.\nThe text was by a man named Ian Westlake, and it was very well done. Westlake, an Englishman, a liberated prisoner of war, had seen the hanging shortly after his liberation by the Russians. The photographs were his.\nNoth, he said, had been hanged from his own apple tree by slave laborers, mostly Poles and Russians, quartered nearby. Westlake did not call my father-in-law \u201cThe Hangman of Berlin.\u201d\nWestlake went to some trouble to find out what crimes Noth had committed, and he concluded that Noth had been no better and no worse than any other big city chief of police.", -0.002999999999999994], "title": "Mother Night"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["nation", 0.07563738447459685], ["poor", 0.0677417216739586],

Lazzaro\u2019s feet was the colonel who had given Billy his knock-out shot.\nThe Blue Fairy Godmother was embarrassed, and angry, too. \u201cIf I\u2019d known I was fighting a chicken,\u201d he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have fought so hard.\u201d\n\u201cUm.\u201d\nThe Blue Fairy Godmother spoke frankly about how disgusting all the Americans were. \u201cWeak, smelly, self-pitying\u2014a pack of sniveling, dirty, thieving bastards,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re worse than the bleeding Russians.\u201d\n\u201cDo seem a scruffy lot,\u201d the colonel agreed.\nA German major came in now. He considered the Englishmen as close friends. He visited them nearly every day, played games with them, lectured to them on German history, played their piano, gave them lessons in conversational German. He told them often that, if it weren\u2019t for their civilized company, he would go mad. His English was splendid.\nHe was apologetic about the Englishmen\u2019s having to put up with the American enlisted men. He promised them that they would not be inconvenienced for more than a day or two, that the Americans would soon be shipped to Dresden as contract labor. He had a monograph with him, published by the German Association of Prison Officials. It was a report on the behavior in Germany of American enlisted men as prisoners of war. It was written by a former American who had risen high in the German Ministry of Propaganda. His name was Howard W. Campbell, Jr. He would later hang himself while awaiting trial as a war criminal.\nSo it goes.\nWhile the British colonel set Lazzaro\u2019s broken arm and mixed plaster for the cast, the German major translated out loud passages from Howard W. Campbell, Jr.\u2019s monograph. Campbell had been a fairly well-known playwright at one time. His opening line was this one:\nAmerica is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, \u201cIt ain\u2019t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.\u201d It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: \u201cIf you\u2019re so smart, why ain\u2019t you rich?\u201d There will also be an American flag no larger than a child\u2019s hand\u2014glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.", -0.08921075837742504], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["remember", 0.16702436495583736], ["boaz", 0.12139324706441618], ["unk", 0.11880585941260524], ["robots", 0.0895864306392219], ["pain", 0.07942774539858927], ["squadmates", 0.0668089221211243], ["command", 0.062239568879653276], ["buddy", 0.05700898574416635], ["squinted", 0.05109455332470136], ["unsurprised", 0.05109455332470136], ["wheedled", 0.05109455332470136], ["washrag", 0.05109455332470136], ["reeled", 0.05109455332470136], ["chucking", 0.05109455332470136], ["whanging", 0.05109455332470136], ["bully", 0.05109455332470136], ["daubing", 0.05109455332470136], ["effeminacy", 0.05109455332470136], ["screamed", 0.05109455332470136], ["unsoldierly", 0.05109455332470136], ["expressionlessly", 0.05109455332470136], ["fainted", 0.05109455332470136], ["sissy", 0.05109455332470136], ["clawed", 0.05109455332470136], ["unsympathetic", 0.05109455332470136], ["feathers", 0.04479321531961095], ["chin", 0.04479321531961095], ["eerie", 0.04479321531961095], ["alert", 0.04479321531961095], ["stood", 0.04160357010076265], ["supposedly", 0.041107168882264004], ["flashing", 0.041107168882264004], ["temples", 0.041107168882264004], ["frowned", 0.041107168882264004], ["nip", 0.041107168882264004], ["deserved", 0.041107168882264004], ["head", 0.04028907652706229], ["warning", 0.03849187731452054], ["execution", 0.03849187731452054], ["responsible", 0.03849187731452054], ["stupid", 0.03849187731452054], ["cunning", 0.03849187731452054], ["circle", 0.03849187731452054], ["attitude", 0.03646329957530045], ["faces", 0.03646329957530045], ["manner", 0.03480583087717359], ["bag", 0.03480583087717359], ["forget", 0.03340446106056215], ["eyed", 0.03340446106056215], ["nature", 0.03219053930943013], ["baby", 0.03219053930943013], ["interesting", 0.031119784439826638], ["glass", 0.031119784439826638], ["hurt", 0.031119784439826638], ["dropped", 0.031119784439826638], ["wet", 0.030161961570210036], ["building", 0.030161961570210036], ["feeling", 0.030161961570210036], ["barrack", 0.028504492872083176], ["watched", 0.027776831893232847], ["cold", 0.027776831893232847], ["rifle", 0.027776831893232847], ["talk", 0.027776831893232847], ["hear", 0.027103123055471738], ["talking", 0.025889201304339717], ["help", 0.025889201304339717], ["stone", 0.02533806837873576], ["sergeant", 0.02481844643473623], ["rest", 0.02432692624137009], ["brackman", 0.02432692624137009], ["hospital", 0.023860623565119622], ["real", 0.02299416738508031], ["floor", 0.021832045825899534], ["people", 0.014181435047006643], ["thing", 0.013722972741307623], ["man", 0.009413030791332528]], "sentiment": ["\"I\u2014I forget,\" said Unk.\n\"Try and remember now,\" said Boaz. \"You had it once.\" He frowned and squinted, as though trying to help Unk remember. \"I think it\u2019s so interesting what a man can remember after he\u2019s been to the hospital.

They were so grateful, and helping them was such an easy thing to do, since the bar was stocked with snacks and garnishes and condiments. The opportunity to be charitable had simply never presented itself before, but here it was now, and he was loving it. To these children, Wait was life itself.\nAnd then the widow Hepburn appeared, as he had been hoping she would all afternoon. Nor did he have to win her trust. She liked him immediately because he was feeding the children, and she said to him, because she had seen so many hungry children on her way to the hotel from Guayaquil International Airport the previous afternoon: \u201cOh, good for you! Good for you!\u201d She assumed then, and would never believe differently, that this man had seen the children outside, and had invited them in so he could feed them.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be like you?\u201d Mary went on. \u201cHere I\u2019ve been upstairs, doing nothing but feel sorry for myself, when I should have been down here like you\u2014sharing whatever we have with all those poor children out there.

A drama critic from a news magazine, speaking to me on the opening night of a play of mine, said that he liked to remind himself from time to time that Shakespeare was standing right behind him, so that he had to be very responsible and wise whenever he expressed an opinion about a play.\nI told him that he had it exactly ass backwards\u2014that Shakespeare was standing behind me and every other playwright who was foolhardy enough to face an opening night, no matter how bad our plays might be.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd here is how I praised my friend Irwin Shaw at a banquet in his honor at The Players Club here in New York, a so-called pipe night, on October 7, 1979.

On his lean midsection lay a fifty-seven-dollar book, a railroad atlas of the Civil War, which his wife had given to him. That was his only enthusiasm in life, the Civil War.\n\"Daddy\u2014\"\nStewart snoozed on. His father had left him fourteen million dollars, tobacco money mostly. That money, churned and fertilized and hybridized and transmogrified in the hydroponic money farm of the Trust Department of the New England Seafarer's Bank and Trust Company of Boston, had increased by about eight hundred thousand dollars a year since it had been put in Stewart's name. Business seemed to be pretty good. Other than that, Stewart didn't know much about business.\nSometimes, when pressed to give his business views, he would declare roundly that he liked Polaroid. People seemed to find this vivid, that he should like Polaroid so much. Actually, he didn't know if he owned any Polaroid or not.

I felt worse then than I did when I was put in prison\u2014worse, even, than when I was turned loose again. I may have felt worse then, even, than when I set fire to the drapes my wife was about to deliver to a client in Chevy Chase.\n\u201cKindly take me home,\u201d Sarah Wyatt said to me. We left without eating, but not without paying. I could not help myself: I cried all the way home.\nI told her brokenly in the taxicab that nothing about the evening had been my own idea, that I was a robot invented and controlled by Alexander Hamilton McCone. I confessed to being half-Polish and half-Lithuanian and nothing but a chauffeur\u2019s son who had been ordered to put on the clothing and airs of a gentleman. I said I wasn\u2019t going back to Harvard, and that I wasn\u2019t even sure I wanted to live anymore.\nI was so pitiful, and Sarah was so contrite and interested, that we became the closest of friends, as I say, off and on for seven years.\nShe would drop out of Pine Manor. She would become a nurse. While in nurse\u2019s training she would become so upset by the sickening and dying of the poor that she would join the Communist Party. She would make me join, too.\nSo I might never have become a communist, if Alexander Hamilton McCone had not insisted that I take a pretty girl to the Arapahoe. And now, forty-five years later, here I was entering the lobby of the Arapahoe again. Why had I chosen to spend my first nights of freedom there? For the irony of it. No American is so old and poor and friendless that he cannot make a collection of some of the most exquisite little ironies in town.\nHere I was again, back where a restaurateur had first said to me, \u201cBon app\u00e9tit!\u201d\nA great chunk of the original lobby was now a travel agency. What remained for overnight guests was a narrow corridor with a reception desk at the far end. It wasn\u2019t wide enough to accommodate a couch or chair. The mirrored French doors through which Sarah and I had peered into the famous dining room were gone. The archway that had framed them was still there, but it was clogged now with masonry as brutal and unadorned as the wall that kept communists from becoming capitalists in Berlin, Germany. There was a pay telephone bolted to the barrier. Its coinbox had been pried open. Its handset was gone.\nAnd yet the man at the reception desk in the distance appeared to be wearing a tuxedo, and even a boutonni\u00e9re!\nAs I advanced on him, it became apparent that my eyes had been tricked on purpose. He was in fact wearing a cotton T-shirt on which were printed a trompe l\u2019oeil tuxedo jacket and shirt, with a boutonni\u00e9re, bow tie, shirtstuds, handkerchief in the pocket, and all.

Behind him came an enormous square banner, held aloft by a staggering giant, and steadied in the wind, maypole fashion, by a dozen Arabs tugging at colored ropes. The banner, which from a distance had given promise of explaining all, was embroidered with four lines of long-forgotten\u2014or perhaps recently invented\u2014script, and with four green owls against a field of apricot. After it came the band, which carried out the Arabian motif.

In its shallow, slimy shelter, he moved toward the culvert.\nThe train that had whistled was approaching now. Its progress was grindingly, clankingly slow.\nWhen the train was overhead, its noise at a maximum, Harve ducked into the culvert.

Jugoslavs, Russians, a fearsome horde of outraged German slaves\u2014came to smash and loot and burn for the merry hell of it, in the wake of the Russian Army. Systematically, in purposeful knots of three and four, they went from house to house, breaking down doors, threatening the occupants, and taking what pleased them. Overlooking plunder was not likely, for Peterswald was built in a narrow draw, only one house deep on either side of a single road. Paul thought that thousands must have explored every house from cellar to attic before the moonlit evening came.\nHe and his friends watched the earnest pillagers at work, giving them sickly smiles whenever a group passed by. An exultant pair of Scotchmen had made friends with such a group, and, while on a cheerful foray, stopped off to talk with the Americans. Each had a handsome bicycle, numerous rings and watches, field glasses, cameras, and other admirable trinkets.\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d one of them explained, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be sittin\u2019 down on a day like this, you\u2019ll never get another chance like this one. You\u2019re the victors, you know, you\u2019ve a bloody good right to anything you like.\u201d\nThe three Americans talked it up among themselves, Paul at the fore, and convinced each other that they would be completely justified in looting the homes of the enemy. The three together beset the nearest house, one which had been vacant since before their arrival in Peterswald. It had already been well-exploited; no glass remained in the windows; every drawer had been dumped, every garment torn from the closets; cupboards had been stripped bare, and pillows and mattresses had been disemboweled by searchers. Each of the marauders before Paul and his friends had examined the heaps discarded by his predecessor until nothing but shreds of cloth and a few pots remained.\nIt was nearly evening when they picked over the sorry lot, and they found nothing to interest them. Paul remarked that there probably was not much in the house to begin with; whoever had lived there had been poor. The furnishings were shabby, the walls peeling, and the outside in need of painting and repair. But when Paul climbed the stairway to the tiny upper floor, he found an amazing room that did not fit into the impoverished pattern. It was a bedroom decorated in gay colors, with beautifully carved furniture, fairyland pictures on candy-striped walls, and freshly painted woodwork. Discarded loot, a forlorn hillock of toys stood in the middle of the floor. The only undisturbed objects in the whole house, leaning against the wall near the head of the bed, were a pair of, \u201cI\u2019ll be damned; look, kids\u2019 crutches.\u201d\nThe Americans, having found nothing of value, agreed that it was getting too late for treasure hunting that day, and proposed that they set about getting supper. They had a good quantity of food on hand that the Russians had given to them, but got the idea that supper on this day of days should certainly be something special, with chicken, milk, and eggs, and maybe even a rabbit. Seeking such delicacies, the trio broke up to scour the neighboring barns and farmyards.\nPaul peered into the small barn behind the house which they had hoped to plunder. Whatever food or livestock may have been here had been carted east hours ago, he reflected. On the dirt floor near the doorway were a few potatoes which he picked up, but nothing else. As he stuffed the potatoes into his pockets and prepared to move on, he heard a slight rustling from one corner. The gentle noise was repeated. When his eyes became accustomed to the darkness he could see a rabbit hutch in which a fat, white rabbit sat, twinkling his pink nose and breathing quickly. This was sensational luck, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance for the banquet. Paul opened the door and removed the unprotesting animal, holding it by its ears. Never having killed a rabbit with his hands, he was dubious as to how he might do it. At last he laid the rabbit\u2019s head on a chopping block and smashed its skull with the back of an axe. It kicked feebly for a few seconds and died.\nDelighted with himself, Paul set about skinning and cleaning the rabbit, cutting off a foot for good luck in surely better days to come. Finished, he stood in the barn doorway, contemplating peace, the sunset, and the stream of sheepish German soldiers shuffling home from the last pocket of resistance. With them were the weary civilians who had fled down the road that morning, only to be turned back by the Russian advance.\nSuddenly Paul was aware of three figures who detached themselves from the dismal procession and moved toward him. They paused before the battered house. A wave of remorse and sorrow billowed in Paul\u2019s chest: \u201cThis must be their little house and barn,\u201d he thought. \u201cThis must belong to that old man and woman, and to that crippled boy.\u201d The woman wept and the man shook his head. The boy kept trying to get their attention, saying something and gesturing toward the barn. Paul stood in the shadows so they could not see him, and he ran away with the rabbit when they went into the house.\nHe brought his contribution to the place that the others had chosen for a fireplace, a knoll from which Paul could see the barn he had left through a gap in a poplar windbreak. The rabbit was placed with the rest of the booty on a cloth stretched over the ground.", 0.02456923558897242], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
