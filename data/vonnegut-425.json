Otherwise, why would a distant cousin, who somehow came into possession of it, have just sent it to me? And why should I feel such urgency about getting it to you as soon as possible?\nAllie was \u201cMoptop,\u201d living then in New Jersey, and \u201cDoc\u201d was our father, the widower Kurt Vonnegut, Sr., in Indianapolis.\nThe mother of the distant cousin, whose name need not concern you, was a relative of Kurt, Sr. She must have gotten this treasure from him. The distant cousin explains that she found it among her late mother\u2019s effects, which had been in a fire. So this gift to you from your mother has been licked by flames, and also broken in two and mended. So it is alive with a story all its own, which it now tells to you. And you can tell it yours. And you two are together at last, as your mother, I am sure, wished and wished so long ago.\nCheers!\nUNKY K\nFebruary 6, 2007\nNew York City", 0.07001262626262626], "title": "Letters"}}
