I\u2019m honored that you should like Cat\u2019s Cradle. As for the next book, which is called God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, I know that Holt plans to give you first look. They should have the final revision within ten days.\nI was a client of Littauer & Wilkinson for about fourteen years, quit them a year and a half ago, sold God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater on my own, appointing Holt its agent. And then, because Max Wilkinson is probably my closest friend, things got patched up again in a half-assed, non-contractual way. All my short stories go through Max. When I get the book out of the way, I hope to do some short stories again.

["I could do the same thing to his dad. On some particularly solemn and sacred occasion, such as the swearing in of new fraternity brothers, I might whisper to him, \u201cAre you a member of the Turtle Club?\u201d He would have no choice but to bellow at the top of his lungs, \u201cYOU BET YOUR ASS I AM!\u201d\n45\nAnother old joke: \u201cHello, my name is Spalding. No doubt you\u2019ve played with my balls.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work anymore because Spalding is no longer a major manufacturer of athletic equipment, just as Lieber Gold Medal Beer is no longer a popular recreational drug in the Middle West, and just as the Vonnegut Hardware Company is no longer a manufacturer and retailer of durable and eminently practical goods out that way.\nThe hardware company was put out of business fair and square by livelier competitors. The Indianapolis Brewery was shut down by Article XVIII of the United States Constitution, which declared in 1919 that the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors was against the law.\nThe Indianapolis humorist Kin Hubbard said about Prohibition that it was \u201cbetter than no liquor at all.\u201d Intoxicating liquors did not become lawful again until 1933. By then, the bootlegger Al Capone owned Chicago, and Joseph P. Kennedy, father of a murdered-President-to-be, was a multimillionaire.\nAt the daybreak that followed the opening of Joe Petro III\u2019s and my show in Denver, a Sunday, I awoke alone in a room in the oldest hotel there, the Oxford. I knew where I was and how I had gotten there. It wasn\u2019t as though I had been drunk as a hooty-owl on Grandfather\u2019s beer the night before.\nI dressed and stepped outside. Nobody else I could see was up yet. There were no moving vehicles.

They banged on the sides of the bus, however, and yelled\u2014agonized by the realization that others were already inside the hotel, and that there would be no food left for them.\nIt was certainly very frightening to be on the bus. It might be turned over. It might be set on fire. Rocks might be thrown, making shrapnel of window glass. The place for survivors to be was on the floor in the aisle. Hisako Hiroguchi performed her first intimate act with blind Selena, instructing her with her hands and murmured Japanese to kneel in the aisle with her head down. Then Hisako knelt beside her and *Kazakh, and put her arm across her back.\nHow tenderly Hisako and Selena would care for each other during the coming years! What a beautiful and sweet-natured child they would rear! How I admired them!\nYes, and *James Wait found himself posing yet again as a protector of children. He was sheltering with his own body the terrified Kanka-bono girls in the aisle. He had meant only to save himself, if he could, but Mary Hepburn had grabbed both his hands and pulled him toward her so that they formed a living fort. If there was to be flying glass, it would bite into them and not into the little girls.\nQuoth Mandarax:\nGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\n\u2014ST. JOHN (4 B.C.?\u201330?)\nIt was while *Wait was in this position that his heart began to fibrillate\u2014which is to say that its fibers began to twitch in an uncoordinated manner, so that the march of the blood in his circulatory system was no longer orderly. Here heredity was operating again. He had no way of knowing this, but *Wait\u2019s father and mother, who were also father and daughter, were both then dead of heart attacks which had struck when they were in their early forties.\nIt was a lucky thing for humanity that *Wait did not live long enough to take part in the Santa Rosalia mating games. Then again, it might not have made all that much difference if people today had inherited his time-bomb heart, since nobody would have lived long enough for the bomb to go off anyway. Anybody *Wait\u2019s age today would be a regular Methuselah.\nDown at the waterfront, meanwhile, another mob, another fibrillating organ in the social system of Ecuador, was stripping the Bah\u00eda de Darwin not only of its food, but of its television sets and telephones and radar and sonar and radios and light bulbs and compasses and toilet paper and carpeting and soap and pots and pans and charts and mattresses and outboard motors and inflatable landing craft, and on and on.

every trash basket in prison, incidentally, which said, \u201cPlease!\u201d Underneath that word was an arrow that pointed straight down.\nIn leafing through the Times, I saw that my son, Walter Stankiewicz, n\u00e9 Starbuck, was reviewing the autobiography of a Swedish motion-picture star. Walter seemed to like it a lot. I gathered that she had had her ups and downs.\nWhat I particularly wanted to read, though, was the Times\u2019s account of its having been taken over by The RAMJAC Corporation. The event might as well have been an epidemic of cholera in Bangladesh. It was given three inches of space on the bottom corner of an inside page. The chairman of the board of RAMJAC, Arpad Leen, said in the story that RAMJAC contemplated no changes in personnel or editorial policy. He pointed out that all publications taken over by RAMJAC in the past, including those of Time Inc., and been allowed to go on as they wished, without any interference from RAMJAC.\n\u201cNothing has changed but the ownership,\u201d he said. And I must say, as a former RAMJAC executive myself, that we didn\u2019t change companies we take over very much. If one of them started to die, of course\u2014then our curiosity was aroused.\nThe story said that the publisher of the Times had received a handwritten note from Mrs. Jack Graham \u201c\u2026 welcoming him to the RAMJAC family.\u201d It said she hoped he would stay on in his present capacity. Beneath the signature were the prints of all her fingers and thumbs. There could be no question about the letter\u2019s being genuine.\nI looked about myself in Bryant Park. Lilies of the valley had raised their little bells above the winter-killed ivy and glassine envelopes that bordered the walks. My wife Ruth and I had had lilies of the valley and ivy growing under the flowering crab apple tree in the front yard of our little brick bungalow in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\nI spoke to the lilies of the valley. \u201cGood morning,\u201d I said.\nYes, and I must have gone into a defensive trance again. Three hours passed without my budging from the bench.\nI was aroused at last by a portable radio that was turned up loud. The young man carrying it sat down on a bench facing mine. He appeared to be Hispanic. I did not learn his name. If he had done me some kindness, he might now be an executive in The RAMJAC Corporation. The radio was tuned to the news. The newscaster said that the air quality that day was unacceptable.\nImagine that: unacceptable air.", 0.028856209150326797], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["letter", 0.24852577110182084], ["fired", 0.19492999925480026], ["americans", 0.19492999925480026], ["times", 0.11972612941598658], ["pessimism", 0.09483932423873434], ["searching", 0.09483932423873434], ["evidence", 0.09483932423873434], ["mccarthy", 0.09483932423873434], ["forms", 0.09483932423873434], ["vanished", 0.09483932423873434], ["quoting", 0.09483932423873434], ["era", 0.09483932423873434], ["senator", 0.09483932423873434], ["minton", 0.08664390003219148], ["wife", 0.08374352079920383], ["pakistan", 0.08328687122940191], ["produced", 0.08328687122940191], ["twelve", 0.08328687122940191], ["communism", 0.08328687122940191], ["frontier", 0.08328687122940191], ["loyalty", 0.08328687122940191], ["worst", 0.08328687122940191], ["hearing", 0.08328687122940191], ["upset", 0.08328687122940191], ["sentence", 0.07652911942759918], ["takes", 0.07652911942759918], ["45", 0.07652911942759918], ["published", 0.07652911942759918], ["printed", 0.07652911942759918], ["forever", 0.0717344182200695], ["awful", 0.06801535903149933], ["sighed", 0.06497666641826676], ["claire", 0.06240748842114578], ["imagine", 0.06018196521073707], ["hours", 0.06018196521073707], ["hated", 0.058218914616464015], ["piece", 0.05646290602216691], ["york", 0.05487440302542816], ["coming", 0.05487440302542816], ["places", 0.053424213408934336], ["husband", 0.049705154220364166], ["real", 0.047619101837797405], ["wrote", 0.044910453012834486], ["lot", 0.04119139382426432], ["couldn", 0.03815270121103175], ["love", 0.037077059192072236], ["things", 0.03031930739026949], ["asked", 0.019658332463453502]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI was fired for pessimism.

from the bar, gulping his beer as he came, and looking nervously at the clock. He was perspiring and short of breath, like a man who\u2019d been running. He had a large parcel wrapped in brown paper under his arm.\nPaul welcomed the opportunity to study Luke\u2019s magnificent costume more closely. Like a stage set, it was designed to impress at a distance. Nearness showed that the splendor was a fraud of cheap cloth, colored glass, and radiator paint. At his waist was a jeweled poniard, basically plywood, with an owl on its hilt. Counterfeit rubies as big as robin\u2019s eggs, mounted in golden sunbursts, were hung at random on the front of his lavender blouse. About the cuffs of his blouse and jade-green pantaloons were circlets of tiny bells, and\u2014again\u2014perched at the upturned tips of his golden slippers were a pair of miniature owls.\n\u201cLuke, you look wonderful,\u201d said Lasher.\nLuke\u2019s eyes flashed agreement, but he was an important man, in too much of a hurry to respond to flattery. \u201cIt\u2019s too much, too much,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I got to change so\u2019s I can march with the Parmesans. They\u2019re waiting up the street, and I got to change, and some damn fool\u2019s locked hisself in the can, so I got no place to change.\u201d He looked around quickly. \u201cWould you let me do it in the booth, and kind of screen me?\u201d\n\u201cYou bet,\u201d said Finnerty.\nThey let Luke squirm into the shadows of the booth, and Paul found himself keeping a playful, leering lookout for women.\nMuttering, Luke started to disrobe. He dropped his belt and poniard on the table, where they struck with an impressive thump. The glittering heap grew and grew, until, from a distance, it might have looked good enough to be at the end of a rainbow.\nPaul relaxed his vigil for an instant to glance at Luke, and he was shocked at the transformation. The man was in his underwear now, ragged and drab, and none-too-clean. And Luke had somehow shrunk and saddened and was knobbed and scarred and scrawny. He was subdued now, talking not at all, and meeting no one\u2019s eyes. Almost desperately, hungrily, he ripped open the brown parcel and took from it a pale-blue uniform, encrusted with gold embroidery and piped in scarlet. He pulled on the trousers and black boots, and the jacket with its ponderous epaulets. Luke was growing again, getting his color back, and as he strapped on his saber he was talkative again\u2014important and strong. He bundled up his other costume in the brown paper, left the parcel with the bartender, and rushed into the street, waving naked steel.\nA whistle blew, and the Parmesans fell in behind him, to be led to glorious exploits in a dreamworld those on the sidewalk could only speculate about.\n\u201cHarmless magic: good, old-fashioned bunkum,\u201d laughed Lasher. \u201cTalk about your hierarchies: Luke, with an I.Q. of about 80, has titles that\u2019d make Charlemagne sound like a cook\u2019s helper. But that sort of business wears thin pretty quick for everybody but a few Luke Lubbocks. The lodge turnover is terrific.\u201d He stood. \u201cNo more for me, thanks.\u201d He rapped on the table. \u201cBut someday, gentlemen, someone is going to give them something to sink their teeth in\u2014probably you, and maybe me.\u201d", 0.1521258503401361], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["music", 0.10986423870078782], ["gun", 0.08652608797676413], ["elliot", 0.08194358472452105], ["radio", 0.07255309496335843], ["ilium", 0.06653145776830419], ["householders", 0.05350500391656437], ["resourceful", 0.05350500391656437], ["lookout", 0.05350500391656437], ["shock", 0.05350500391656437], ["warns", 0.05350500391656437], ["dial", 0.05350500391656437], ["announcer", 0.05350500391656437], ["teenage", 0.05350500391656437], ["asinine", 0.05350500391656437], ["management", 0.05350500391656437], ["relieved", 0.05350500391656437], ["closing", 0.05350500391656437], ["fashionable", 0.05350500391656437], ["limply", 0.05350500391656437], ["units", 0.05350500391656437], ["prowlers", 0.05350500391656437], ["attempt", 0.05350500391656437], ["bulletin", 0.05350500391656437], ["news", 0.047566883730084185], ["protest", 0.04684012718041104], ["helps", 0.04684012718041104], ["wkll", 0.04684012718041104], ["characterized", 0.04684012718041104], ["barrels", 0.04684012718041104], ["harvey", 0.04684012718041104], ["continue", 0.04684012718041104], ["maniac", 0.04684012718041104], ["rushed", 0.04684012718041104], ["offered", 0.04684012718041104], ["sobbed", 0.04684012718041104], ["escaped", 0.04684012718041104], ["friendly", 0.042941424217832536], ["warned", 0.042941424217832536], ["stupid", 0.042941424217832536], ["sirens", 0.042941424217832536], ["ripped", 0.042941424217832536], ["tremendous", 0.042941424217832536], ["dangerous", 0.042941424217832536], ["mad", 0.042941424217832536], ["extremely", 0.042941424217832536], ["reward", 0.042941424217832536], ["harve", 0.04100151002686041], ["police", 0.04097179236226053], ["blast", 0.040175250444257724], ["roared", 0.040175250444257724], ["pleasure", 0.040175250444257724], ["listening", 0.03802963937392878], ["report", 0.03802963937392878], ["believed", 0.03802963937392878], ["road", 0.03802963937392878], ["alive", 0.03802963937392878], ["persons", 0.03802963937392878], ["man", 0.03651538040313208], ["hole", 0.03627654748167922], ["tonight", 0.03627654748167922], ["knocked", 0.03627654748167922], ["sixty", 0.03479432940641712], ["chief", 0.03237784451910072], ["clock", 0.03136476263777546], ["doors", 0.03136476263777546], ["dollar", 0.030448318601195415], ["wait", 0.030448318601195415], ["station", 0.029611670745525894], ["reason", 0.028842029325588044], ["finally", 0.0281294526702638], ["windows", 0.0281294526702638], ["dog", 0.0281294526702638], ["key", 0.027466059675196955], ["killed", 0.02684549697195108], ["locked", 0.026262567916023823], ["held", 0.02469988590162214], ["dead", 0.02423074970768529], ["club", 0.0225542748312932], ["side", 0.021127159397463652], ["love", 0.020485896181130264], ["turned", 0.01779758019825371], ["house", 0.017339618188741645], ["voice", 0.017339618188741645], ["woman", 0.015889398095139878], ["door", 0.015512275853281405], ["head", 0.01446228266131033]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThey let me go home,\u201d said the old man, \u201cwhen I could finally see for myself that nobody was really trying to do me in, when I could see for myself it was all in my head.\u201d He turned on the radio. \u201cLet\u2019s have some music while we wait,\u201d he said. \u201cMusic always helps.\u201d\nAsinine music about teenage love came from the radio.

Moellenkamp. He had been allowed to stay on the Board, even though he didn\u2019t have a nickel. Mrs. Chung had dropped out by then. Fedders was there. Wilder, as I\u2019ve said, had since become a Trustee. There were some other new Trustees I didn\u2019t know.\nALL THE TRUSTEES survived the ordeal of captivity, with nothing to eat but horse meat roasted over burning furniture in the huge fireplace in the Pavilion, although Fedders would be the worse for an untreated heart attack. While he was going through the worst of it, he spoke Chinese.\nI WOULDN\u2019T BE under indictment now if I hadn\u2019t paid a compassionate visit to the hostages. They wouldn\u2019t have known that I was within 1,000 kilometers of Scipio. But when I appeared to them, seemingly free to come and go as I pleased, and treated with deference by the Black man who was actually guarding me, they jumped to the conclusion that I was the mastermind behind the great escape.\nIt was a racist conclusion, based on the belief that Black people couldn\u2019t mastermind anything. I will say so in court.\nIN VIETNAM, THOUGH, I really was the mastermind. Yes, and that still bothers me. During my last year there, when my ammunition was language instead of bullets, I invented justifications for all the killing and dying we were doing which impressed even me! I was a genius of lethal hocus pocus!\nYou want to know how I used to begin my speeches to fresh troops who hadn\u2019t yet been fed into the meat grinder? I squared my shoulders and threw out my chest so they could see all my ribbons, and I roared through a bullhorn, \u201cMen, I want you to listen, and to listen good!\u201d\nAnd they did, they did.\nI HAVE BEEN wondering lately how many human beings I actually killed with conventional weaponry. I don\u2019t believe it was my conscience which suggested that I do this. It was the list of women I was making, trying to remember all the names and faces and places and dates, which led to the logical question: \u201cWhy not list all you\u2019ve killed?\u201d\nSo I think I will. It can\u2019t be a list of names, since I never knew the name of anybody I killed. It has to be a list of dates and places. If my list of women isn\u2019t to include high school or prostitutes, then my list of those whose lives I took shouldn\u2019t include possibles and probables, or those killed by artillery or air strikes called in by me, and surely not all those, many of them Americans, who died as an indirect result of all my hocus pocus, all my blah blah blah.\nI HAVE LONG had a sort of ballpark figure in my head. I am quite sure that I killed more people than did my brother-in-law. I hadn\u2019t been working as a teacher at Athena very long before it occurred to me that I had almost certainly killed more people than had the mass murderer Alton Darwin or anybody else serving time in there. That didn\u2019t trouble me, and still doesn\u2019t.
