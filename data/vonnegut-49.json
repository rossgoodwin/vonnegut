taken \u201cThe Sisters B-36\u201d on the first Christmas Eve, 2000, about how Prince believed a bag lady had put on such a show while throwing the yellow manuscript pages away to ensure that Prince would wonder what they were and retrieve them, the old science fiction writer commented: \u201cPerfectly understandable, Dudley. For anybody who could believe in God, as you once did, it would be a piece of cake to believe in the planet Booboo.\u201d\nGet a load of what was going to happen to Dudley Prince, a monumental figure of authority and decency in the uniform of the security company that protected the beleaguered Academy around the clock, a holstered pistol at his hip, only fifty-one days from the first of the two Christmas Eves, 2000: The timequake was going to zap him back into a solitary confinement cell, into the hole, within the walls and towers of the New York State Maximum Security Adult Correctional Facility at Athena, sixty miles south of his hometown of Rochester, where he used to own a little video rental store.\nTo be sure, the timequake had made him ten years younger, but that was no break in his case. It meant he was again serving two consecutive life sentences, without hope of parole, for the rape and murder of a ten-year-old girl of Chinese-American and Italian-American parentage, Kimberly Wang, in a Rochester crack house, of which he was entirely innocent!\nGranted, at the start of the rerun Dudley Prince could remember, as could the rest of us, everything that was going to happen to him during the next ten years. He knew that in seven years he would be exonerated by DNA tests of dried ejaculate material on the victim\u2019s panties. This exculpatory evidence would again be found languishing in a glassine envelope in the walk-in vault of the District Attorney who had framed him in the hopes of being nominated for Governor.\nAnd, oh yes, that same DA would be found wearing cement overshoes on the bottom of Lake Cayuga in just six more years. Prince meanwhile was going to have to earn a High School Equivalency Certificate again, and make Jesus the center of his life again, and on and on.\nAnd then, after he was sprung again, he would have to go on TV talk shows again with other people who had been wrongly incarcerated and then rightly exonerated, to say prison was the luckiest thing that ever happened to him because he found Jesus there.\n17\nOn either one of the two Christmas Eves, 2000, and it didn\u2019t matter which, except for people\u2019s opinions of what was going on, the ex-jailbird Dudley Prince delivered \u201cThe Sisters B-36\u201d to Monica Pepper\u2019s office. Her husband Zoltan in his wheelchair was predicting the end of literacy in the not-too-distant future.\n\u201cThe prophet Mohammed couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Zoltan was saying. \u201cJesus, Mary, and Joseph probably couldn\u2019t do it, Mary Magdalen couldn\u2019t do it. The Emperor Charlemagne confessed he couldn\u2019t do it. It was just too hard!

Nancy lost track of the time down there. When Billy announced that they had at last reached their destination, it was possible for Nancy to imagine that a year had passed.\nShe tested this spooky impression by pinching her own thigh, by feeling what the chemical clock of her body said. Her thigh was still numb.\nBilly ordered her to climb iron rungs that were set in wet masonry. There was a circle of sickly light above. It proved to be moonlight filtered through the plastic polygons of an enormous geodesic dome. Nancy didn\u2019t have to ask the traditional victim\u2019s question, \"Where am I?\" There was only one dome like that on Cape Cod. It was in Hyannis Port and it sheltered the ancient Kennedy Compound.\nIt was a museum of how life had been lived in more expansive times. The museum was closed. It was open only in the summertime.\nThe manhole from which Nancy and then Billy emerged was set in an expanse of green cement, which showed where the Kennedy lawn had been. On the green cement, in front of the ancient frame houses, were statues representing the fourteen Kennedys who had been Presidents of the United States or the World. They were playing touch football.\nThe President of the World at the time of Nancy\u2019s abduction, incidentally, was an ex-Suicide Hostess named \"Ma\" Kennedy. Her statue would never join this particular touch-football game. Her name was Kennedy, all right, but she wasn\u2019t the real thing. People complained of her lack of style, found her vulgar. On the wall of her office was a sign that said, YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO BE CRAZY TO WORK HERE, BUT IT SURE HELPS, and another one that said THIMK!, and another one that said, SOMEDAY WE\u2019RE GOING

of the things the National Rifle Association still says about how natural and beautiful it is for Americans to have love affairs with guns. He said that he had taught Felix and me about guns when we were so young in order to make our safety habits second nature. \u201cMy boys will never have a shooting accident,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause their respect for weapons has become a part of their nervous systems.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t about to say so, but I had some doubts at that point about the gun safety habits of Felix, and of his friend Bucky Morissey, too\u2014the son of the chief of police. For the past couple of years, anyway, Felix and Bucky, without Father\u2019s knowledge, had been helping themselves to various weapons in the gun room, and had picked off crows perched on headstones in Calvary Cemetery, and had cut off telephone service to several farms by shooting insulators along the Sheperdstown Turnpike, and had blasted God-only-knows how many mailboxes all over the county, and had actually loosed a couple of rounds at a herd of sheep out near Sacred Miracle Cave.\nAlso: After a big Thanksgiving Day football game between Midland City and Sheperdstown, a bunch of Shepherdstown tough guys had caught Felix and Bucky walking home from the football field. They were going to beat up Felix and Bucky, but Felix dispersed them by pulling from the belt under his jacket a fully loaded Colt .45 automatic.\nHe wasn\u2019t kidding around.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBut Father knew nothing of this, obviously, as he blathered on about safety habits. And, after Mrs. Roosevelt made her departure, he sent me up to the gun room, to clean the Springfield without further delay.\nSo this was Mother\u2019s Day to most people, but to me it was the day during which, ready or not, I had been initiated into manhood. I had killed the chickens. Now I had been made master of all these guns and all this ammunition. It was something to savor. It was something to think about and I had the Springfield in my arms. It loved to be held. It was born to be held.\nI liked it so much, and it liked me so much, since I had fired it so well that morning, that I took it with me when I climbed the ladder up into the cupola. I wanted to sit up there for a while, and look out over the roofs of the town, supposing that my brother might be going to his death, and hearing and feeling the tanks in the street below. Ah, sweet mystery of life.\nI had a clip of ammunition in my breast pocket. It had been there since morning. It felt good. So I pushed it down into the rifle\u2019s magazine, since I knew the rifle enjoyed that so. It just ate up those cartridges.\nI slid forward the bolt, which caught the topmost cartridge and delivered it into the chamber. I locked the bolt. Now the rifle was cocked, with a live cartridge snugly home.", 0.1931024531024531], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["paint", 0.1369042786551631], ["dreams", 0.12531956128064417], ["indianapolis", 0.1107245434587587], ["fool", 0.1011110509838669], ["business", 0.08819719030549385], ["wife", 0.08789184552880752], ["children", 0.08130684582501133], ["rocket", 0.07835424190700935], ["widower", 0.07835424190700935], ["oldest", 0.07835424190700935], ["moist", 0.07835424190700935], ["choose", 0.07835424190700935], ["ilya", 0.07835424190700935], ["wallpaper", 0.07835424190700935], ["grandchildren", 0.07835424190700935], ["borisoglebsk", 0.07835424190700935], ["tanya", 0.07835424190700935], ["died", 0.074126433588414], ["borrowed", 0.06845213932758155], ["managed", 0.06845213932758155], ["suicide", 0.06845213932758155], ["fortune", 0.06845213932758155], ["wanted", 0.06590694580407741], ["exhibit", 0.06265978064032209], ["spirit", 0.06265978064032209], ["sadly", 0.05855003674815377], ["paintings", 0.05855003674815377], ["underground", 0.05855003674815377], ["painting", 0.05855003674815377], ["young", 0.0576874580197408], ["bought", 0.05536227172937935], ["expert", 0.05536227172937935], ["artist", 0.05536227172937935], ["years", 0.053539400595612296], ["canvas", 0.052757678060894285], ["youth", 0.052757678060894285], ["marvelous", 0.05055552549193345], ["late", 0.05055552549193345], ["famous", 0.05055552549193345], ["named", 0.04864793416872598], ["greenwich", 0.04864793416872598], ["nice", 0.046965319373634795], ["village", 0.04546016914995156], ["supposed", 0.04546016914995156], ["son", 0.044098595152746924], ["started", 0.044098595152746924], ["hadn", 0.044098595152746924], ["ago", 0.04065342291250566], ["live", 0.03966781046269206], ["eyes", 0.03787976556334913], ["true", 0.03787976556334913], ["story", 0.037063216794207], ["twenty", 0.035558066570523766], ["three", 0.027977662983921337], ["life", 0.02565596399109598], ["things", 0.023051370322610915], ["told", 0.022185304296661847], ["man", 0.014230865196550214]], "sentiment": ["\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t have one,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMarvelous paintings!\u201d I said. \u201cWhere do you exhibit?\u201d\n\u201cI never have,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019d make a fortune if you did,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re nice to say so,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I started painting too late.\u201d He then told me what was supposed to be the story of his life, none of it true.\nHe said he was a widower from Indianapolis.

Hide!\u201d He slid aside the bale that blocked the tunnel entrance and crawled into the secret chamber. Hope followed, pulling the bale back into place, remaining prone in the tunnel. They lay motionless in the darkness, their hearts throbbing against the floor.\nSuddenly the cough came again\u2014explosive and sharp in Haley\u2019s ear. \u201cRun!\u201d he shouted. His cry ended in a gurgle as a pair of powerful arms closed over his throat and chest. He drove his head backward into the face of his assailant and struck out with the steel-shod heels of his work shoes. The arms relaxed for an instant. Haley wriggled free and scrambled for the exit. The portal bale was tumbled to one side, leaving a square of light to guide him. Hope had fled.\nPanting heavily, he thrust his head and shoulders through the doorway. Hands seized his ankles and started to drag him back in. He kicked again, savagely, rolled from the tunnel, and raced down the channel between bales, down the loft ladder, and toward the house.\nHope\u2019s silhouette danced before him, sprinting up the kitchen steps. She cried for help as she ran. Haley turned his head to look quickly at the black hole of the barn door and saw a figure dart from it, and he lengthened his panic-driven stride, shouting, \u201cHe\u2019s after us!\u201d\nHe overtook Hope as she rushed through the darkened kitchen, and the two of them burst into the sunroom together. The General was on his feet, and Annie\u2019s eyes were wide with terror.\n\u201cBanghart!\u201d panted Haley, pointing toward the barn. The General snatched his pistol belt from the tabletop and fumbled with the catch on the holster. \u201cKeep calm,\u201d he commanded. \u201cIf I can\u2019t handle this, the police can. I phoned them right after supper, and they\u2019ll be here any minute.\u201d\n\u201cDrop it,\u201d ordered a voice from the kitchen shadows. The pistol fell back on the table with a thump. Annie whimpered. Haley turned to face the speaker. Mr. Banghart winked at him over the sights of the shotgun they had left leaning against the kitchen doorframe. He stepped into the light, and, as he swung the muzzle from Haley to the General, Haley saw his face as a red-eyed nightmare, sweat-streaked with the brown dust of the barn and bristling with stiff, glistening beard.\n\u201cHaley, now don\u2019t you and the girls be scared,\u201d said Mr. Banghart, nervously apologetic. \u201cIt\u2019s the old devil I\u2019m here to settle up with. One shot\u2019s all I\u2019ve got, and that\u2019s for his honor over there.\u201d\nAnnie, Hope, and Haley had flattened themselves against the wall to Mr. Banghart\u2019s right.

He walked over to his dresser and picked up the two hairbrushes the General had given him. He scrubbed his hair into a natty part, leaned his elbows on the dresser top, and winked at himself in the mirror.\nWhen he sauntered into the kitchen, he was greeted by cheery good-mornings from Annie and Hope.

The railroad yard was a desert now, except for a hospital train marked with red crosses\u2014on a siding far, far away. Its locomotive whistled. The locomotive of Billy Pilgrim\u2019s train whistled back. They were saying, \u201cHello.\u201d\nEven though Billy\u2019s train wasn\u2019t moving, its boxcars were kept locked tight. Nobody was to get off until the final destination. To the guards who walked up and down outside, each car became a single organism which ate and drank and excreted through its ventilators. It talked or sometimes yelled through its ventilators, too. In went water and loaves of blackbread and sausage and cheese, and out came shit and piss and language.\nHuman beings in there were excreting into steel helmets which were passed to the people at the ventilators, who dumped them. Billy was a dumper. The human beings also passed canteens, which guards would fill with water. When food came in, the human beings were quiet and trusting and beautiful. They shared.\nHuman beings in there took turns standing or lying down. The legs of those who stood were like fence posts driven into a warm, squirming, farting, sighing earth. The queer earth was a mosaic of sleepers who nestled like spoons.\nNow the train began to creep eastward.\nSomewhere in there was Christmas. Billy Pilgrim nestled like a spoon with the hobo on Christmas night, and he fell asleep, and he traveled in time to 1967 again\u2014to the night he was kidnapped by a flying saucer from Tralfamadore.\n4\nBILLY PILGRIM could not sleep on his daughter\u2019s wedding night. He was forty-four. The wedding had taken place that afternoon in a gaily striped tent in Billy\u2019s backyard.

At least poor *Siegfried wasn\u2019t going to suffer long. He started going crazy when he had only a few more hours to live\u2014on the afternoon of Thursday, November 27, 1986. There he was, standing in back of the bar at the El Dorado, with James Wait seated before him and the portrait of Charles Darwin at his back. He had just seen his most trustworthy employee, Jes\u00fas Ortiz, go out the front door, terribly upset about something.\nAnd then *Siegfried\u2019s big brain had him swoon into madness for a moment, and then back to sanity again.\nAt that early stage of the disease, the only stage the unlucky brother would know, it was still possible for his soul to recognize that his brain had become dangerous, and to help him maintain a semblance of mental health through sheer willpower. So he kept a straight face and tried to return to business as usual by putting a question to Wait.\n\u201cWhat do you do for a living, Mr. Flemming?\u201d he inquired.\nWhen *Siegfried spoke these words, they came back to him hellishly, as though he were shouting into an empty steel barrel at the top of his lungs. He had become extremely sensitive to noises.\nAnd Wait\u2019s reply, although spoken softly, was also an ear splitter. \u201cI used to be an engineer,\u201d said Wait, \u201cbut I lost interest in that and in everything, to tell the truth, after my wife died. I guess you\u2019d call me a survivor now.\u201d\nSo Jes\u00fas Ortiz left the hotel after having been so hideously insulted by *Andrew MacIntosh. He intended to walk all over the neighborhood until he had calmed down some. But he soon discovered that barbed wire and soldiers had turned the area around the hotel into a cordon sanitaire. The necessity for such a barrier was also evident. Crowds of people of all ages on the other side of the wire looked at him as soulfully as had Kazakh, the seeing-eye dog, hoping against hope that he might have food for them.\nHe stayed within the fence, and walked around the hotel again and again. On each of three laps he passed the open doorway of the laundry room. Right inside was a gray steel box fixed to the wall. He knew what it contained: the junctions which married the hotel\u2019s telephones to the outside world. A good citizen of a million years ago might have thought of such a box, \u201cWhat the telephone company hath joined together, let no man put asunder.\u201d\nYes, and such was the overt sentiment in the brain of Jes\u00fas Ortiz. He would never harm a box that important to so many people. But brains back then were so big that they could actually deceive their owners. His brain wanted him to disconnect all the telephones the first time he went past the laundry room, but it knew how opposed his soul was to bad citizenship. So, in order to keep him from becoming paralyzed, his brain kept reassuring him, in effect, \u201cNo, no\u2014of course we would never do such a thing.\u201d\nOn the fourth lap, it got him into the laundry room, but also gave him a cover story for what he was doing in there. Good citizen that he was, he was searching for the green pants suit of a hotel guest, Mary Hepburn, which had apparently disappeared into some other universe the night before.", 0.014447383891828338], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["funeral", 0.19373108518842028], ["pants", 0.1700817507548096], ["mohammedan", 0.09783710608774052], ["mortician", 0.09783710608774052], ["buried", 0.08572164309449358], ["suit", 0.08014745710943383], ["seek", 0.07749243407536811], ["father", 0.07399777834203117], ["casket", 0.07216498828922403], ["fit", 0.06803270030192385], ["fortune", 0.05932892938996579], ["mother", 0.05734244177416077], ["pork", 0.04891855304387026], ["adventure", 0.04891855304387026], ["assumption", 0.04891855304387026], ["fillip", 0.04891855304387026], ["burying", 0.04891855304387026], ["uncritically", 0.04891855304387026], ["advise", 0.04891855304387026], ["fillips", 0.04891855304387026], ["pluralistic", 0.04891855304387026], ["mohammedans", 0.04891855304387026], ["funerals", 0.04891855304387026], ["pious", 0.04891855304387026], ["ignacio", 0.04649287049070754], ["wearing", 0.04649287049070754], ["san", 0.044311703163737476], ["los", 0.04250052359424114], ["madly", 0.04250052359424114], ["undertaker", 0.04250052359424114], ["surprising", 0.04250052359424114], ["angeles", 0.04250052359424114], ["paved", 0.04250052359424114], ["vision", 0.04250052359424114], ["roebuck", 0.03874621703768406], ["streets", 0.03874621703768406], ["sears", 0.03874621703768406], ["democracy", 0.03874621703768406], ["biggest", 0.03874621703768406], ["coat", 0.03874621703768406], ["unexpected", 0.036082494144612016], ["eat", 0.036082494144612016], ["wear", 0.036082494144612016], ["spoil", 0.036082494144612016], ["pair", 0.036082494144612016], ["boots", 0.034016350150961924], ["bankrupt", 0.034016350150961924], ["trouble", 0.034016350150961924], ["exciting", 0.034016350150961924], ["cowboy", 0.034016350150961924], ["nicely", 0.034016350150961924], ["gold", 0.030900866478543287], ["laid", 0.030900866478543287], ["closed", 0.029664464694982896], ["town", 0.02857388103149786], ["movies", 0.02857388103149786], ["answer", 0.0275983207013328], ["perfect", 0.02671581903647794], ["bottom", 0.02671581903647794], ["news", 0.02671581903647794], ["piece", 0.025910158138425815], ["hope", 0.02516902195626344], ["weren", 0.02324643524535377], ["turned", 0.022155851581868738], ["care", 0.022155851581868738], ["good", 0.02201591049103496], ["wrong", 0.02165522916269952], ["incidentally", 0.020728530472357086], ["half", 0.020728530472357086], ["going", 0.019427726372976465], ["left", 0.018750992506634315], ["looked", 0.017122375224563353], ["died", 0.015737822132239617], ["wasn", 0.01307409923916757], ["told", 0.010410376346095524], ["people", 0.009319792682610491], ["years", 0.008578656500448117], ["time", 0.006851008763592449]], "sentiment": ["And he said, \u201cNo. I like it very much.

So Father had gone to the trouble of getting pants that fit from Sears, Roebuck.\nBut there were two unexpected fillips to the mortician\u2019s answer. He wasn\u2019t the one who had buried my mother, incidentally. The one who buried my mother had gone bankrupt and left town to seek his fortune elsewhere. The one who was burying my father had come to seek his fortune in San Ignacio, where the streets were paved with gold.\nOne surprising piece of news from him was that my father was going to be buried wearing a pair of his own cowboy boots, which he had been wearing when he died at the movies.\nThe other fillip was the undertaker\u2019s assumption that Father was a Mohammedan. This was exciting to him. It was his biggest adventure in being uncritically pious in a madly pluralistic democracy.\n\u201cYour father is the first Mohammedan I\u2019ve taken care of,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I haven\u2019t done anything wrong so far.

["What good is a planet called Earth, after all, if you own no land?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd let us end on a sunnier note, with an essay I wrote in May of 1980 at the behest of the International Paper Company. That company, for obvious reasons, hopes that Americans will continue to read and write. And so it has asked various well-known persons to write leaflets for free distribution to anyone hankering to read and write some\u2014about how to increase one\u2019s vocabulary, how to write an effective business letter, about how to do library research, and so on.\nIn view of the fact that I had nearly flunked chemistry, mechanical engineering, and anthropology, and had never taken a course in literature or composition, I was elected to write about literary style. I was more than glad to do this. But I must bring up the joyless subject of triage again, for I intended my essay not for the bottom third of would-be writers, the warm corpses, nor for the top third\u2014those who are or could be brilliant writers anyway.\nMy essay is for the middle third, and it goes like this:\nNewspaper reporters and technical writers are trained to reveal almost nothing about themselves in their writings. This makes them freaks in the world of writers, since almost all of the other ink-stained wretches in that world reveal a lot about themselves to readers. We call these revelations, accidental and intentional, elements of literary style.\nThese revelations are fascinating to us as readers. They tell us what sort of person it is with whom we are spending time. Does the writer sound ignorant or informed, crazy or sane, stupid or bright, crooked or honest, humorless or playful\u2014? And on and on.\nWhen you yourself put words on paper, remember that the most damning revelation you can make about yourself is that you do not know what is interesting and what is not. Don\u2019t you yourself like or dislike writers mainly for what they choose to show you or make you think about? Did you ever admire an empty-headed writer for his or her mastery of the language? No.\nSo your own winning literary style must begin with interesting ideas in your head. Find a subject you care about and which you in your heart feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, and not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.\nI am not urging you to write a novel, by the way\u2014 although I would not be sorry if you wrote one, provided you genuinely cared about something. A petition to the mayor about a pothole in front of your house or a love letter to the girl next door will do.", 0.2467054263565892], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["dreamer", 0.26912150480325503], ["robert", 0.24111538189245138], ["dreams", 0.21821646414357976], ["nancy", 0.2038576511383517], ["things", 0.1651655171274269], ["edgy", 0.1538148407505149], ["bob", 0.1538148407505149], ["edginess", 0.1538148407505149], ["glorious", 0.1538148407505149], ["sees", 0.13456075240162751], ["businesses", 0.13456075240162751], ["hm", 0.13456075240162751], ["mixed", 0.13456075240162751], ["increased", 0.12329783273195628], ["echoed", 0.12329783273195628], ["fancy", 0.11530666405274015], ["uncle", 0.10404374438306893], ["till", 0.0960525757038528], ["charley", 0.08720663872833793], ["crazy", 0.08720663872833793], ["shrugged", 0.08478965603418155], ["nodded", 0.07352673636451033], ["lost", 0.07060005537401516], ["heard", 0.062263816694839096], ["voice", 0.05134596702512778], ["thing", 0.04102475712422548], ["good", 0.03388461537450628]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYou haven\u2019t said much,\u201d said Nancy. \u201cTell me\u2014tell me a few little things.\u201d\nRobert shrugged. \u201cDreamer,\u201d he said.\nNancy tried to make something of this, could make very little. \u201cDreamer?\u201d she echoed.\n\u201cLost everything he had in different crazy businesses,\u201d said Robert.\nNancy nodded. \u201cI see.\u201d She still saw very little. \u201cBob?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d said Robert.\n\u201cWhat does that have to do with dreams?\u201d she said.\n\u201cNever sees things the way they really are,\u201d said Robert.

there we were joint owners of a secondhand Ford Phaeton and often went out together with our girls. Phaeton was the son of Helios, the sun. He borrowed his father\u2019s flaming chariot one day and drove it so irresponsibly that parts of northern Africa were turned into deserts. In order to keep the whole planet from being desolated, Zeus had to kill him with a thunderbolt. \u201cGood for Zeus,\u201d I say. What choice did he have?\nBut my friendship with Clewes was never deep and it ended when he took a girl away from me and married her. She was a member of a fine old New England family, which owned the Wyatt Clock Company in Brockton, Massachusetts, among other things. Her brother was my roommate at Harvard in my freshman year, which was how I got to know her. She was one of the four women I have ever truly loved. Sarah Wyatt was her maiden name.\nWhen I accidentally ruined him, Leland Clewes and I had not exchanged any sort of greeting for ten years or more. He and his Sarah had a child, a daughter, three years older than mine. He had become the brightest meteor in the State Department, and it was widely conceded that he would be secretary of state some day, and maybe even president. No one in Washington was better-looking and more charming than Leland Clewes.\nI ruined him in this way: Under oath, and in reply to a question by Congressman Nixon, I named a number of men who were known to have been communists during the Great Depression, but who had proved themselves to be outstanding patriots during World War Two. On that roll of honor I included the name of Leland Clewes. No particular comment was made about this at the time. It was only when I got home late that afternoon that I learned from my wife, who had been listening to me and then to every news program she could find on the radio, that Leland Clewes had never been connected with communism in any way before.\nBy the time Ruth put on supper\u2014and we had to eat off a packing case since the bungalow wasn\u2019t fully furnished yet\u2014the radio was able to give us Leland Clewes\u2019s reply. He wished to appear before Congress at the earliest opportunity, in order to swear under oath that he had never been a communist, had never sympathized with any communist cause. His boss, the secretary of state, another Yale man, was quoted as saying that Leland Clewes was the most patriotic American he had ever known, and that he had proved his loyalty beyond question in negotiations with representatives of the Soviet Union. According to him, Leland Clewes had bested the communists again and again. He suggested that I might still be a communist, and that I might have been given the job of ruining Leland Clewes by my masters.\nTwo horrible years later Leland Clewes was convicted on six counts of perjury. He became one of the first prisoners to serve his sentence in the then new Federal Minimum Security Adult Correctional Facility on the edge of Finletter Air Force Base\u2014thirty-five miles from Atlanta, Georgia.\nSmall world.\n5\nALMOST TWENTY YEARS later Richard M. Nixon, having become President of the United States, would suddenly wonder what had become of me. He would almost certainly never have become President, of course, if he had not become a national figure as the discoverer and hounder of the mendacious Leland Clewes. His emissaries would find me, as I say, helping my wife with her decorating business, which she ran out of our little brick bungalow in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\nThrough them, he would offer me a job.", 0.12736619441164898], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["crystals", 0.24576453805397286], ["oranges", 0.18656916243685445], ["atoms", 0.16384302536931525], ["cannonballs", 0.16384302536931525], ["stack", 0.16384302536931525], ["lock", 0.14111688830177607], ["layer", 0.13992687182764083], ["ways", 0.11107456922393491], ["seed", 0.10583766622633205], ["freeze", 0.10035052971860556], ["crate", 0.09328458121842723], ["properties", 0.09328458121842723], ["lawn", 0.09328458121842723], ["crystallize", 0.08192151268465762], ["courthouse", 0.07527454369927788], ["pattern", 0.07527454369927788], ["factory", 0.07527454369927788], ["growing", 0.07527454369927788], ["bottom", 0.07055844415088804], ["breed", 0.051133808401963174], ["spotted", 0.04664229060921361], ["fashion", 0.04664229060921361], ["villain", 0.04664229060921361], ["carefully", 0.04664229060921361], ["packed", 0.04664229060921361], ["ethylene", 0.04664229060921361], ["determined", 0.04664229060921361], ["behave", 0.04664229060921361], ["diamine", 0.04664229060921361], ["tartrate", 0.04664229060921361], ["theoretical", 0.04664229060921361], ["junk", 0.04664229060921361], ["undesired", 0.04664229060921361], ["crystallizing", 0.04664229060921361], ["desired", 0.04664229060921361], ["liquids", 0.04664229060921361], ["manufacturing", 0.04664229060921361], ["substance", 0.04664229060921361], ["applications", 0.04664229060921361], ["orderly", 0.04664229060921361], ["cannonball", 0.04664229060921361], ["dr", 0.04276514104285163], ["operations", 0.04096075634232881], ["discovered", 0.04096075634232881], ["industrial", 0.04096075634232881], ["physical", 0.04096075634232881], ["20", 0.04096075634232881], ["subsequent", 0.04096075634232881], ["novel", 0.04096075634232881], ["liquid", 0.04096075634232881], ["grain", 0.04096075634232881], ["rigid", 0.04096075634232881], ["begun", 0.03763727184963894], ["infinite", 0.03763727184963894], ["stacked", 0.03763727184963894], ["forming", 0.03763727184963894], ["changed", 0.03763727184963894], ["hadn", 0.03527922207544402], ["orange", 0.03527922207544402], ["helped", 0.03527922207544402], ["pure", 0.03345017657286852], ["taught", 0.03345017657286852], ["mystery", 0.03345017657286852], ["crystal", 0.03345017657286852], ["tiny", 0.03195573758275414], ["listen", 0.030692207420235634], ["number", 0.029597687808559217], ["longer", 0.029597687808559217], ["invited", 0.028632253090064272], ["meant", 0.026987411323981067], ["suggested", 0.025010673153350836], ["hands", 0.02059266904898455], ["big", 0.0196272343304896], ["ice", 0.017982392564406396], ["called", 0.017044602800654392], ["day", 0.015083703709950836], ["going", 0.014576528269638643], ["god", 0.01364760461958124], ["told", 0.011363068533769595], ["man", 0.008977373804831724]], "sentiment": ["\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Dr. Breed, \u201clisten carefully. Here we go.\u201d\n20\nICE-NINE\n\u201cTHERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS,\u201d Dr. Breed said to me, \u201cin which certain liquids can crystallize\u2014can freeze\u2014 several ways in which their atoms can stack and lock in an orderly, rigid way.\u201d\nThat old man with spotted hands invited me to think of the several ways in which cannonballs might be stacked on a courthouse lawn, of the several ways in which oranges might be packed into a crate.\n\u201cSo it is with atoms in crystals, too; and two different crystals of the same substance can have quite different physical properties.\u201d\nHe told me about a factory that had been growing big crystals of ethylene diamine tartrate. The crystals were useful in certain manufacturing operations, he said. But one day the factory discovered that the crystals it was growing no longer had the properties desired. The atoms had begun to stack and lock\u2014to freeze\u2014in a different fashion. The liquid that was crystallizing hadn\u2019t changed, but the crystals it was forming were, as far as industrial applications went, pure junk.\nHow this had come about was a mystery. The theoretical villain, however, was what Dr. Breed called \u201ca seed.\u201d He meant by that a tiny grain of the undesired crystal pattern. The seed, which had come from God-only-knows-where, taught the atoms the novel way in which to stack and lock, to crystallize, to freeze.\n\u201cNow think about cannonballs on a courthouse lawn or about oranges in a crate again,\u201d he suggested. And he helped me to see that the pattern of the bottom layer of cannonballs or of oranges determined how each subsequent layer would stack and lock. \u201cThe bottom layer is the seed of how every cannonball or every orange that comes after is going to behave, even to an infinite number of cannonballs or oranges.\u201d", 0.05214285714285714], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["rabbit", 0.20951795929089342], ["hardware", 0.10475897964544671], ["reproducing", 0.10475897964544671], ["rabbits", 0.09259850279351785], ["store", 0.09259850279351785], ["card", 0.07579524701137227], ["coffee", 0.07062020510061666], ["place", 0.07020947109608212], ["finnerty", 0.0696917502620429], ["worked", 0.05845972824868778], ["tubes", 0.05845972824868778], ["girl", 0.057249326994530746], ["hours", 0.057249326994530746], ["amiss", 0.052379489822723356], ["steered", 0.052379489822723356], ["summoned", 0.052379489822723356], ["stories", 0.052379489822723356], ["breathing", 0.052379489822723356], ["morose", 0.052379489822723356], ["swayed", 0.052379489822723356], ["curve", 0.052379489822723356], ["whiskey", 0.052379489822723356], ["talking", 0.049003649288465206], ["kroner", 0.04864190740771546], ["evidently", 0.046299251396758924], ["smoothed", 0.046299251396758924], ["clearly", 0.046299251396758924], ["drudgery", 0.046299251396758924], ["presented", 0.046299251396758924], ["example", 0.046299251396758924], ["jokes", 0.0427425399221259], ["increase", 0.0427425399221259], ["eliminated", 0.0427425399221259], ["ignored", 0.04021901297079449], ["sakes", 0.04021901297079449], ["plot", 0.04021901297079449], ["doorway", 0.04021901297079449], ["cup", 0.03826161339786282], ["shallow", 0.03826161339786282], ["waiter", 0.03826161339786282], ["drop", 0.03826161339786282], ["goddamn", 0.03666230149616147], ["measure", 0.03666230149616147], ["huge", 0.03666230149616147], ["clerk", 0.03666230149616147], ["anita", 0.03648143055578659], ["squinted", 0.03531010255030833], ["terms", 0.03531010255030833], ["vacuum", 0.03531010255030833], ["cleared", 0.03413877454483006], ["dirty", 0.03413877454483006], ["boy", 0.03382825564834934], ["revolution", 0.03310559002152844], ["heaven", 0.03310559002152844], ["pocket", 0.031345320763088526], ["silence", 0.030582063070197035], ["standing", 0.02922986412434389], ["story", 0.02922986412434389], ["number", 0.028058536118865624], ["arm", 0.027025351595564014], ["telling", 0.02655107772477212], ["fell", 0.026101136545933958], ["picked", 0.02487515459527467], ["industrial", 0.024501824644232603], ["engineer", 0.023468640120930993], ["feet", 0.023468640120930993], ["black", 0.02284180710354376], ["laughed", 0.02254442507130094], ["man", 0.022454421772992297], ["real", 0.022256795046537863], ["nodded", 0.022256795046537863], ["second", 0.02144650276468685], ["set", 0.02094511316959958], ["kind", 0.02094511316959958], ["river", 0.02094511316959958], ["told", 0.019184843911159658], ["work", 0.01842158621826817], ["big", 0.017069387272415026], ["time", 0.010096318194608996], ["paul", 0.007840488753130792]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThe others\u2014across the river,\u201d said Paul.\n\u201cThey never did work,\u201d said Kroner, and again everyone laughed.\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re reproducing like rabbits,\u201d said Anita.\n\u201cSomebody telling dirty jokes about rabbits reproducing?\u201d said Finnerty, standing in the doorway.

They had grown up in the rural south of the nation, where their ancestors had been used as agricultural machinery. The white farmers down there weren\u2019t using machines made out of meat anymore, though, because machines made out of metal were cheaper and more reliable, and required simpler homes.\nSo the black machines had to get out of there, or starve to death. They came to cities because everyplace else had signs like this on the fences and trees:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nKilgore Trout once wrote a story called \u201cThis Means You.\u201d It was set in the Hawaiian Islands, the place where the lucky winners of Dwayne Hoover\u2019s contest in Midland City were supposed to go. Every bit of land on the islands was owned by only about forty people, and, in the story, Trout had those people decide to exercise their property rights to the full. They put up no trespassing signs on everything.\nThis created terrible problems for the million other people on the islands. The law of gravity required that they stick somewhere on the surface. Either that, or they could go out into the water and bob offshore.\nBut then the Federal Government came through with an emergency program. It gave a big balloon full of helium to every man, woman and child who didn\u2019t own property.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere was a cable with a harness on it dangling from each balloon.
