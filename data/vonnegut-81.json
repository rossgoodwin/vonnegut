Determinedly, they kept within the small salary Herbert made as a bookkeeper for a wholesale grocery house.\nGod knows it\u2019s no disgrace to live that way, which is better than the way I live, but it was pretty disturbing to watch, knowing Herbert had an income, after taxes, of perhaps twenty thousand a year.\nI had our securities analysts look over Foster\u2019s holdings, and report on the stocks\u2019 growth possibilities, prospective earnings, the effects of war and peace, inflation and deflation, and so on. The report ran to twenty pages, a record for any of my clients. Usually, the reports are bound in cardboard covers. Herbert\u2019s was done up in red leatherette.\nIt arrived at my place on a Saturday afternoon, and I called up Herbert to ask if I could bring it out. I had exciting news for him. My by-eye estimate of the values had been off, and his portfolio, as of that day, was worth close to eight hundred and fifty thousand.", 0.050509726898615784], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["barbara", 0.11436777446258457], ["ketchum", 0.08115482716690374], ["children", 0.06399519894902796], ["pregnant", 0.04783271477108263], ["metzger", 0.047514058226921355], ["george", 0.046382525154588794], ["technician", 0.0438988179921944], ["remarry", 0.0438988179921944], ["alcoholics", 0.0438988179921944], ["legitimate", 0.0438988179921944], ["liberia", 0.0438988179921944], ["alma", 0.0438988179921944], ["illegitimate", 0.0438988179921944], ["greece", 0.0438988179921944], ["tankers", 0.0438988179921944], ["concealed", 0.0438988179921944], ["alaska", 0.0438988179921944], ["stricken", 0.0438988179921944], ["unknown", 0.0438988179921944], ["welder", 0.0438988179921944], ["fathered", 0.0438988179921944], ["plainly", 0.0438988179921944], ["solitude", 0.0438988179921944], ["rayed", 0.0438988179921944], ["loving", 0.0438988179921944], ["believer", 0.0438988179921944], ["sweden", 0.0438988179921944], ["adore", 0.0438988179921944], ["mater", 0.0438988179921944], ["ray", 0.0438988179921944], ["badly", 0.0438988179921944], ["amused", 0.0438988179921944], ["deserted", 0.0438988179921944], ["vietnam", 0.0438988179921944], ["child", 0.04381334715746782], ["enriched", 0.03812259148752819], ["eugene", 0.03812259148752819], ["wives", 0.03812259148752819], ["schools", 0.03812259148752819], ["flunked", 0.03812259148752819], ["debs", 0.03812259148752819], ["intolerable", 0.03812259148752819], ["ill", 0.03812259148752819], ["control", 0.03812259148752819], ["escaped", 0.03812259148752819], ["product", 0.03812259148752819], ["birth", 0.03474371558662682], ["fled", 0.03474371558662682], ["shoulder", 0.03474371558662682], ["harvard", 0.03474371558662682], ["comical", 0.03474371558662682], ["sophisticated", 0.03474371558662682], ["carrying", 0.03474371558662682], ["paris", 0.032346364982861975], ["flew", 0.032346364982861975], ["cedar", 0.032346364982861975], ["satisfaction", 0.032346364982861975], ["lovely", 0.032346364982861975], ["parts", 0.032346364982861975], ["sons", 0.032346364982861975], ["athens", 0.030486835388576897], ["native", 0.030486835388576897], ["spoken", 0.028967489081960607], ["owned", 0.028967489081960607], ["spoke", 0.028967489081960607], ["question", 0.028967489081960607], ["flag", 0.028967489081960607], ["hero", 0.027682900083400123], ["met", 0.027682900083400123], ["baby", 0.027682900083400123], ["wife", 0.027171199988949037], ["luck", 0.026570138478195768], ["key", 0.026570138478195768], ["opinion", 0.026570138478195768], ["happy", 0.02471060888391069], ["longer", 0.02471060888391069], ["war", 0.023986946042903884], ["true", 0.023916357385541313], ["law", 0.023916357385541313], ["working", 0.023191262577294397], ["felix", 0.022763022679758542], ["bad", 0.02190667357873391], ["lived", 0.02190667357873391], ["matter", 0.02133173298300932], ["neutron", 0.02133173298300932], ["public", 0.020793911973529557], ["wonderful", 0.020793911973529557], ["life", 0.01955855994735379], ["bomb", 0.019361826499140734], ["rest", 0.019361826499140734], ["twenty", 0.01893438237924448], ["midland", 0.017229194241101146], ["turned", 0.01643351077549166], ["waltz", 0.015838019408973784], ["will", 0.015555506478343107], ["three", 0.014761254979973734], ["city", 0.01395068933700024], ["school", 0.013807835386825866], ["years", 0.00759291110311447], ["father", 0.005439480351850572]], "sentiment": ["\u201cDid he ever remarry?\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ketchum.\nFelix\u2019s fifth wife, Barbara, and the first loving wife he had ever had, in my opinion, found the solitude of old George Metzger in Cedar Key intolerable.

He would soon find out.\nDr. Streit had given Berman his home phone number, saying, \u201cIn case something has bothered you so much you don\u2019t know what to do next.\u201d Dr. Streit was already in bed, although it was only 8:30 in Wisconsin, which is on Central Standard Time. Dr. Streit was drunk as a hoot-owl, lying on his back with an open copy of \u201cThe Myth of Sisyphus\u201d by Albert Camus for a roof over his face, when the phone on his bedside table rang and rang. He picked it up, and here\u2019s what he heard: \u201cDoc, this is Gil Berman. I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry about me. But you can\u2019t believe what happened at my show tonight. What a fucking zoo! The theater manager looked like an albino giraffe. The cop on duty looked like a sentimental hippopotamus! And there was this deranged woman who looked like a gorilla in a haystack. And then this circus midget came in with another cop, who looked like a transsexual iguana! Honest to God! And the midget, a girl, said to the gorilla in a haystack, \u2018Aunt Martha, you\u2019ve stopped taking your pills again. Now look at the trouble you\u2019ve caused for these nice strangers.\u2019 And the gorilla in a haystack said, \u2018I just wanted to make sure this man knew that he, like the holy clowns Abbie Hoffman and Lenny Bruce, was a reincarnation of Jesus Christ.\u2019 All I need to know from you, Doc, is where do I go to get detoxed from sobriety?\u201d\nBerman paused for breath. He had been guffawing in agony, in the style of the opening lines of Who\u2019s Sorry Now? When he got set to spout some more, though, he realized that the phone was dead. Dr. Streit had apparently hung up on him, which was indeed the case. Some doctor!\n\u201cSobriety,\u201d incidentally, is generally understood to mean a life without one specific mind-bender, which is alcohol. But get a load of this: Gil Berman had been entitled to credit himself with sobriety, when defined that narrowly, for eighteen years! He hadn\u2019t had an alcoholic beverage since his first stay at Junkie Junction, at the Caldwell Institute. When he spoke of sobriety there in Northampton, he meant he was at last free of the drugs that had, not only in his own opinion, but in the opinions of several colleagues and critics, as well, made him deeper and quicker as a comedian than he would have otherwise been.\nOn the subject of alcohol abuse, in fact, he had become quite the prude. When he was in the company of people who were drinking booze, he would order \u201ca double Shirley Temple, please, and don\u2019t hold back on the grenadine.\u201d Grenadine is a cloyingly sweet, nonalcoholic, red-orange syrup flavored with pomegranates and is the most exciting ingredient in a Shirley Temple cocktail. A Shirley Temple cocktail, in turn, is what grownups who are drinking hard liquor, tossing down what the late W. C. Fields called \u201cNose Paint,\u201d order for any children they happen to have somehow brought with them into a drinking establishment.\nIn the beginning, immediately after Gil Berman got out of Crawford for the first time, persons serving him thought he was kidding, since no adult in history had ever ordered a Shirley Temple. So there was bargle-bargle before it was clear he was dead serious: \u201cWhere\u2019s the manager? I want to see the manager. I want a Shirley fucking Temple cocktail, and you, for reasons impossible for this sane citizen of the United fucking States of America to fathom, will not let me have one,\u201d and so on. That sort of thing.\nIn more recent times, though, his lusty consumption of Shirley Temples had become as widely known as his chastity and wealth, to the point that he was often served a Shirley Temple without having ordered one. The sobriquet he had given Shirley Temples in performances and interviews, moreover, had become patois for many gin-mill professionals. The nickname was \u201cFootin-the-door.\u201d A waitress might say to a bartender, \u201cTwo feet in the door,\u201d and the bartender might reply, \u201cTwo Shirley Temples coming up.\u201d Someone at the Hotel Northampton had been so hip as to have a pitcher of Shirley Temples and a bucket of ice waiting for Berman in his room.\nIn his Rolling Stone interview he declared: \u201cDrugs are science. Alcohol is superstition.\u201d\nA Gil Berman joke about Caldwell, which he gave gratis to a comedy team, since it took two people to make it work: Al: You\u2019re looking so happy and healthy, Joe. Just get out of Junkie Junction?\nJoe: Better than that, Al, I just shipped the wife and mother-in-law up to sunny Wisconsin for new pills, old religion, and detox.", 0.03724575298438935], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["pilot", 0.14177484118868783], ["button", 0.14177484118868783], ["universe", 0.13869124226944451], ["today", 0.11904870412114865], ["guide", 0.11904870412114865], ["stupid", 0.1117325221108467], ["prevent", 0.08225048912811352], ["fuels", 0.08225048912811352], ["gropingly", 0.08225048912811352], ["wiped", 0.08225048912811352], ["preventing", 0.08225048912811352], ["test", 0.08225048912811352], ["starter", 0.08225048912811352], ["presses", 0.08225048912811352], ["deflated", 0.08225048912811352], ["disappears", 0.08225048912811352], ["pressing", 0.07088742059434391], ["blow", 0.07088742059434391], ["peaceful", 0.07088742059434391], ["horrible", 0.07088742059434391], ["experimenting", 0.07088742059434391], ["spend", 0.07088742059434391], ["suppose", 0.07088742059434391], ["moment", 0.06973469111209049], ["earth", 0.06796199533273717], ["ends", 0.06424045160896417], ["structured", 0.059524352060574326], ["eternity", 0.059524352060574326], ["pleasant", 0.059524352060574326], ["ignore", 0.059524352060574326], ["pressed", 0.059524352060574326], ["will", 0.05644075314133099], ["saucers", 0.05586626105542335], ["wars", 0.05287738307519458], ["planet", 0.05035032275015756], ["moments", 0.04816128352680473], ["mind", 0.04623041408981484], ["telling", 0.04450319252165375], ["tralfamadorian", 0.04450319252165375], ["zoo", 0.04294073055764843], ["simply", 0.03898725421638796], ["nice", 0.03898725421638796], ["flying", 0.036798214993035136], ["idea", 0.034867345556045246], ["days", 0.033980997666368584], ["course", 0.03084894460468483], ["read", 0.028839070472023647], ["war", 0.010829032952874306], ["billy", 0.010086663021762627]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWould\u2014would you mind telling me\u2014\u201d he said to the guide, much deflated, \u201cwhat was so stupid about that?\u201d\n\u201cWe know how the Universe ends\u2014\u201d said the guide, \u201cand Earth has nothing to do with it, except that it gets wiped out, too.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2014how does the Universe end?\u201d said Billy.\n\u201cWe blow it up, experimenting with new fuels for our flying saucers.

reunited with him at the far end of the blue tunnel into the Afterlife. All she could be sure of was that he had departed her room at the El Dorado, and exchanged some words with *Zenji Hiroguchi out in the corridor. Then the two went down together in the elevator. After that, she would never again receive news about either one of them.\nHere is the story on her blindness, by the way: She had retinitis pigmentosa, caused by a defective gene inherited on the female side. She had got it from her mother, who could see perfectly well, and who had concealed from her husband the certainty that this was a gene she carried.\nThis was another disease with which Mandarax was familiar, since it was one of the top one thousand serious diseases of Homo sapiens. Mandarax, when asked about it by Mary on Santa Rosalia, would pronounce Selena\u2019s case a severe one, since she was blind at birth. It was more usual for retinitis pigmentosa, said Mandarax, son of Gokubi, to let its hosts and hostesses see the world clearly for as long as thirty years sometimes. Mandarax confirmed, too, what Selena herself had told Mary: that if she had a baby, there was a fifty-fifty chance that it would be blind. And if that baby was a female, whether it went blind or not, and that baby grew up and reproduced, there would be a fifty-fifty chance that its child would be blind.\nIt is amazing that two such relatively rare hereditary defects, retinitis pigmentosa and Huntington\u2019s chorea, should have been causes for worry to the first human settlers of Santa Rosalia, since the settlers numbered only ten.\nAs I have already said, the Captain luckily turned out not to be a carrier. Selena was surely a carrier. If she had reproduced, though, I think humankind would still be free of retinitis pigmentosa now\u2014thanks to the Law of Natural Selection, and sharks and killer whales.\nHere is how her father and *Zenji Hiroguchi died, incidentally, while she and her dog Kazakh listened to the noise of the crowd outside: They were shot in their heads from behind, so they never knew what hit them. And the soldier who shot them is another person who should be credited with having done a little something whose effects are still visible after a million years. I am not talking about the shootings. I am talking about his breaking into the back door of a shuttered souvenir shop which faced the El Dorado.\nIf he had not burglarized that shop, there would almost certainly be no human beings on the face of the earth today. I mean it. Everybody alive today should thank God that this soldier was insane.\nHis name was Private Geraldo Delgado, and he had deserted his unit, taking his first-aid kit and canteen and trenchknife, automatic assault rifle and two grenades and several clips of ammunition and so on with him. He was only eighteen years old, and was a paranoid schizophrenic. He should never have been issued live ammunition.\nHis big brain was telling him all sorts of things that were not true\u2014that he was the greatest dancer in the world, that he was the son of Frank Sinatra, that people envious of his dancing ability were attempting to destroy his brains with little radios, and on and on.", 0.0506790373977874], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["lazarus", 0.19463216000325015], ["luxe", 0.189645653809985], ["dura", 0.18447533017135326], ["sateen", 0.18447533017135326], ["joke", 0.14353391401868693], ["antique", 0.12286520299390671], ["bridgehampton", 0.12286520299390671], ["brought", 0.11977458268073388], ["idiot", 0.10674550112041961], ["life", 0.08775711893043064], ["babyshit", 0.08543641433264855], ["collector", 0.08119637812813799], ["chance", 0.08119637812813799], ["bring", 0.08119637812813799], ["autobiography", 0.07761147859727151], ["jesus", 0.0745060973734454], ["big", 0.07188530746300559], ["brown", 0.06931671245916146], ["baltimore", 0.06931671245916146], ["basement", 0.06507667625465088], ["hope", 0.06321521793666167], ["pictures", 0.06285479516342618], ["week", 0.06149177672378442], ["writing", 0.05838639549995831], ["sold", 0.056976520573994716], ["foyer", 0.056976520573994716], ["serious", 0.05564725513585637], ["half", 0.052062355604989896], ["guess", 0.04709551606317457], ["great", 0.028436295771896956]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI brought you back to life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re my Lazarus.

KNOWS\nFROM POLITICS TODAY, January/February 1979:\n\u201cWho in America is truly happy?\u201d my offspring used to ask me in one way or another as they entered adolescence, which is children\u2019s menopause. I was silent then, but need not have been. There was an answer then which holds good today: \u201cWilliam F. Buckley, Jr.\u201d I have his fifteenth solo book at hand, a collection of 130 or so pieces published elsewhere (with one interesting exception) since 1975 began. Norman Mailer has said of himself that he is one of the best \u201cfast writers\u201d around. Buckley is at least twice as fast. He can do a column in 20 minutes, he tells us, and turn out 150 a year, plus a book and many reviews and speeches and articles, and television introductions besides. The fast writings collected in this volume are uniformly first rate\u2014not only in terms of unbridled happiness (where Mailer surely falls short), but as shrewd comedies and celebrations of the English language.\nHe is a superb sailor and skier as well\u2014and multilingual, and a musician, and an airplane pilot, and a family man, and polite and amusing to strangers. More: He is, like the Yale-educated hero of his novel Saving the Queen, startlingly good-looking. His distinctly American features are animated, but tempered with a certain shyness, a reserve. (The last nine words are Buckley\u2019s own gloss on the good looks of the hero, Bradford Oakes.)\nSo whenever I see Mr. Buckley, I think this, and, word of honor, without an atom of irony: \u201cThere is a man who has won the decathlon of human existence.\u201d\nI also marvel at how much he resembles a far more lopsided genius, the comedian Stanley Laurel. Laurel also managed to imply, despite his beauty and seriousness, that something screamingly funny was going on. People cannot earn or cultivate that look, in my opinion. Peer through the window of any hospital nursery, and you will find that one infant in fifty has it. The difficult part for many, but easy as pie for Laurel and Buckley, is living up to such a face.\nI would give a million dollars to look like that.\nI wonder, too, when I see Buckley: Would he have known that it was possible to be genuinely funny and conservative at the same time, if it had not been for the pioneering work of H. L. Mencken? Probably so. That face of his, when coupled with his fine mind and high social position, would have made him sound like a spiritual son of Mencken\u2019s, even if he had never heard of the Sage of Baltimore.\nHow serious is he about conservatism? Well\u2014serious enough to devote his life to it, surely, but beyond that? The ideals he defends, conventional Republicanisms, really, were logically his from birth. He was rich and brilliant with congenial and enterprising relatives before he wore his first diaper\u2014and he had the rare gift of being happy a lot, as I say. And nothing changed much except, perhaps, that life kept getting better and better.\nMost important: there has never been anything to be ashamed of. It is a quite unusual experience in America to have never been ashamed. Buckley\u2019s intellectual voyage has been one of confirmations rather than discoveries. So there is the chance that he is more playful about conservatism than many who have come to it the hard Way\u2014than Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, say. Buckley has not come to conservatism through rage and pain.", 0.2707338017174083], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["amy", 0.34520692633561534], ["hostetter", 0.2466618670130449], ["sister", 0.16714452572699728], ["record", 0.1203950666347373], ["tensely", 0.11781562270252205], ["ting", 0.1030678103501828], ["typing", 0.1030678103501828], ["ling", 0.1030678103501828], ["stalked", 0.09444089315639205], ["recreation", 0.09444089315639205], ["upset", 0.09444089315639205], ["hand", 0.08557335074052659], ["strange", 0.08357226286349864], ["passionately", 0.08357226286349864], ["lip", 0.0796930808040528], ["ordinary", 0.0796930808040528], ["perfectly", 0.0796930808040528], ["listening", 0.07641327910560049], ["watching", 0.07357218564550427], ["bit", 0.07357218564550427], ["murmured", 0.06679657434510991], ["break", 0.06679657434510991], ["filled", 0.06494526845171354], ["shoulder", 0.06494526845171354], ["dropped", 0.061665466753261226], ["tears", 0.058824373293165005], ["big", 0.05799774455842126], ["coffee", 0.05753448772260256], ["fine", 0.0530385495594705], ["white", 0.050197456099374274], ["hear", 0.048494419765894775], ["room", 0.03932882580648085], ["turned", 0.038290737207131234], ["eyes", 0.03682280377123866], ["looked", 0.02932874858848648]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThere, there,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThere, there.\u201d Tears filled her eyes.\nA hand dropped on Amy\u2019s shoulder.

The building was a cheap old frame thing set up on cement blocks, and it was out in the middle of nowhere. Cars came and went, and the folks sure seemed to like whatever was doing the droning,\u201d he said.\nSo he had a look inside. \u201cIt was full of folks on roller-skates,\u201d he said. \u201cThey went around and around.
