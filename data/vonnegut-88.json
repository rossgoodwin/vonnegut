It consisted of a one-rail fence with twelve buckets underneath it. The fence was sheltered on three sides by a screen of scrap lumber and flattened tin cans. The open side faced the black tarpaper wall of the shed where the feast had taken place.\nBilly moved along the screen and reached a point where he could see a message freshly painted on the tarpaper wall. The words were written with the same pink paint which had brightened the set for Cinderella. Billy\u2019s perceptions were so unreliable that he saw the words as hanging in air, painted on a transparent curtain, perhaps. And there were lovely silver dots on the curtain, too. These were really nailheads holding the tarpaper to the shed. Billy could not imagine how the curtain was supported in nothingness, and he supposed that the magic curtain and the theatrical grief were part of some religious ceremony he knew nothing about.\nHere is what the message said:\nBilly looked inside the latrine. The wailing was coming from in there. The place was crammed with Americans who had taken their pants down. The welcome feast had made them as sick as volcanoes. The buckets were full or had been kicked over.\nAn American near Billy wailed that he had excreted everything but his brains. Moments later he said, \u201cThere they go, there they go.\u201d He meant his brains.\nThat was I. That was me. That was the author of this book.\nBilly reeled away from his vision of Hell. He passed three Englishmen who were watching the excrement festival from a distance. They were catatonic with disgust.\n\u201cButton your pants!\u201d said one as Billy went by.\nSo Billy buttoned his pants. He came to the door of the little hospital by accident. He went through the door, and found himself honeymooning again, going from the bathroom back to bed with his bride on Cape Ann.\n\u201cI missed you,\u201d said Valencia.", 0.028454184704184707], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["boaz", 0.1506006448543509], ["sell", 0.13311877158035015], ["shoes", 0.10649501726428012], ["uniform", 0.09189327844377784], ["stitches", 0.0845173062513857], ["luster", 0.0845173062513857], ["pupils", 0.0845173062513857], ["unk", 0.0831434875010135], ["eyes", 0.07617632630042816], ["dull", 0.07409404037830383], ["remember", 0.05920305095104869], ["continued", 0.05757355483442248], ["silken", 0.04225865312569285], ["gonna", 0.04225865312569285], ["disquieting", 0.04225865312569285], ["compelled", 0.04225865312569285], ["brightness", 0.04225865312569285], ["eyebrow", 0.04225865312569285], ["wearer", 0.04225865312569285], ["dump", 0.04225865312569285], ["crackle", 0.04225865312569285], ["tended", 0.04225865312569285], ["thread", 0.04225865312569285], ["piercing", 0.04225865312569285], ["sharpness", 0.04225865312569285], ["scratchy", 0.04225865312569285], ["puzzling", 0.04225865312569285], ["alarmed", 0.04225865312569285], ["amused", 0.04225865312569285], ["increasingly", 0.037047020189151916], ["bunch", 0.037047020189151916], ["achieve", 0.037047020189151916], ["ruefully", 0.037047020189151916], ["polish", 0.037047020189151916], ["clumsy", 0.037047020189151916], ["bite", 0.037047020189151916], ["coarse", 0.037047020189151916], ["rid", 0.037047020189151916], ["looked", 0.0363849852740905], ["grace", 0.03399841035375218], ["numerous", 0.03399841035375218], ["stare", 0.03399841035375218], ["ruby", 0.03399841035375218], ["genuine", 0.03399841035375218], ["chance", 0.03399841035375218], ["grateful", 0.031835387252610974], ["leather", 0.031835387252610974], ["eh", 0.031835387252610974], ["movement", 0.031835387252610974], ["uniformly", 0.031835387252610974], ["thick", 0.03015761619009812], ["ordinary", 0.03015761619009812], ["diamonds", 0.02878677741721124], ["murmured", 0.02878677741721124], ["area", 0.02878677741721124], ["gaze", 0.02878677741721124], ["meet", 0.02878677741721124], ["badly", 0.02878677741721124], ["paper", 0.027627749749337117], ["moonmist", 0.027627749749337117], ["raised", 0.027627749749337117], ["squadmates", 0.027627749749337117], ["rich", 0.02662375431607003], ["soldiers", 0.025738167581811505], ["colored", 0.025738167581811505], ["position", 0.025738167581811505], ["bright", 0.024945983253557173], ["tiny", 0.024945983253557173], ["deep", 0.024229365360291574], ["smiled", 0.02297331961094446], ["reason", 0.02189737341815744], ["question", 0.020956297155345367], ["simply", 0.020526534645270565], ["sergeant", 0.020526534645270565], ["sense", 0.020526534645270565], ["brackman", 0.020120014184591802], ["soldier", 0.020120014184591802], ["attention", 0.01973435031701623], ["held", 0.01936750697739644], ["yellow", 0.019017732423750634], ["wanted", 0.018683508645022558], ["matter", 0.018363511544129355], ["company", 0.018056579254503376], ["stood", 0.01720448387625523], ["felt", 0.01694063936639606], ["earth", 0.009501443902462844], ["good", 0.008767320071155204], ["man", 0.007785213436440437]], "sentiment": ["Everyone else\u2019s uniform was coarse, scratchy\u2014held together by clumsy stitches of thick thread.

The stitches were numerous and tiny. And most puzzling of all: Boaz\u2019s shoes had a deep, rich, ruby luster\u2014a luster that other soldiers could not achieve no matter how much they might polish their shoes. Unlike the shoes of anyone else in the company area, the shoes of Boaz were genuine leather from Earth.\n\"You say sell something, Unk?\" said Boaz.\n\"Dump MoonMist. Get rid of it,\" murmured Unk. The words made no sense to him. He had let them out simply because they had wanted out so badly. \"Sell,\" he said.\nBoaz smiled\u2014ruefully amused. \"Sell it, eh?\" he said. \"O.K., Unk\u2014we sell it.\" He raised an eyebrow. \"What we gonna sell, Unk?\" There was something particularly bright and piercing about the pupils of his eyes.\nUnk found this yellow brightness, this sharpness of Boaz\u2019s eyes disquieting\u2014increasingly so, as Boaz continued to stare. Unk looked away, looked by chance into the eyes of some of his other squadmates\u2014found their eyes to be uniformly dull.

was still on the hem of his lovely new blue velour shirt. This man had royal blood in his veins! This was Prince Richard of Croatia-Slavonia, a direct descendant of James the First of England and Emperor Frederick the Third of Germany and Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and King Louis the Fifteenth of France. He ran an antique shop on upper Madison Avenue, and he wasn\u2019t homosexual. He wanted young Wait to strangle him with a silken sash from his dressing gown, and then to loosen the sash after having brought him as close as possible to death.\nPrince Richard had a wife and two children, who were on a skiing vacation in Switzerland, and his wife was young enough to be ovulating still, so young Wait may have prevented yet another carrier of those noble genes from being born.\nThere was this, too: If Prince Richard hadn\u2019t been murdered, he and his wife might have been invited by Bobby King to take part in \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d\nHis widow would become a very successful designer of neckties, calling herself \u201cPrincess Charlotte,\u201d although she was a commoner, the daughter of a Staten Island roofer, and not entitled to that rank, or the use of his coat of arms. That crest nonetheless appeared on every tie she designed.\nThe late Andrew MacIntosh owned several Princess Charlotte ties.\nWait spread-eagled this porky, chinless blue-blood face up on a four-poster bed which the Prince said had belonged to Eleonore of Palatinate-Neuburg, the mother of King Joseph the First of Hungary. Wait tied him to the thick posts with nylon ropes already cut to length. These had been stored in a secret drawer under the flounce at the foot of the bed. This was an old drawer, and had one time concealed secrets of the sex life of Eleonore of Palatinate-Neuburg.\n\u201cTie me nice and tight, so I can\u2019t get away,\u201d Prince Richard told young Wait, \u201cbut don\u2019t cut off the circulation. I would hate to get gangrene.\u201d\nHis big brain had had him doing this at least once a month for the past three years: hiring strangers to tie him up and strangle him just a little bit. What a survival scheme!\nPrince Richard of Croatia-Slavonia, possibly with the ghosts of his progenitors looking on, instructed young James Wait to strangle him to the point where he lost consciousness. Then Wait, whom he knew only as \u201cJimmy,\u201d was to count slowly to twenty in this manner: \u201cOne thousand and one, one thousand and two \u2026\u201d and so on.", 0.004497491145218425], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["emperor", 0.2656883454012621], ["clothes", 0.18319418767870588], ["reasons", 0.13284417270063106], ["return", 0.10170673609708421], ["wanted", 0.09643367574840506], ["respond", 0.08386037664663473], ["wonderland", 0.08386037664663473], ["vivid", 0.08386037664663473], ["clapped", 0.08386037664663473], ["performance", 0.08386037664663473], ["topping", 0.08386037664663473], ["negotiating", 0.08386037664663473], ["super", 0.08386037664663473], ["17", 0.08386037664663473], ["alice", 0.08386037664663473], ["mentions", 0.08386037664663473], ["concession", 0.08386037664663473], ["appreciatively", 0.08386037664663473], ["realistic", 0.07285804044727053], ["sentence", 0.06642208635031553], ["biggest", 0.06642208635031553], ["contract", 0.06642208635031553], ["rate", 0.06185570424790632], ["meeting", 0.06185570424790632], ["terms", 0.05831374311593473], ["ordered", 0.055419750150951325], ["fine", 0.050853368048542104], ["clear", 0.04898379605399633], ["afraid", 0.047311406916570514], ["longer", 0.047311406916570514], ["baltimore", 0.047311406916570514], ["heart", 0.04441741395158711], ["learn", 0.04441741395158711], ["alive", 0.04197057776385286], ["living", 0.04197057776385286], ["felt", 0.04197057776385286], ["supposed", 0.04087545281961553], ["writing", 0.03985103184917789], ["widow", 0.038888736264790044], ["hands", 0.037981459854632124], ["hear", 0.03712324999319917], ["studio", 0.035534623666897865], ["times", 0.033415077752222896], ["sort", 0.03154550575767714], ["potato", 0.03096824156448864], ["best", 0.028848695649813683], ["night", 0.028360256623357272], ["barn", 0.026979123655267914], ["painting", 0.02343716252329633], ["dan", 0.019408900288755065], ["gregory", 0.017846359450449472], ["berman", 0.016652336891122686], ["time", 0.01174458645187277]], "sentiment": ["17\nWE MADE SOME SORT of contract that night.

going on between men and women these days. He began this book way back in 1962, and there have been countless gut-ripping news items and confrontations since then. But Heller\u2019s man Slocum is deaf and blind to them. He receives signals from only three sources: his office, his memory and home.\nAnd, on the basis of these signals alone, he is able to say, apparently in all seriousness: \u201cThe world just doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s an idea whose time is gone.\u201d\nThis is black humor indeed\u2014with the humor removed.\nRobert Slocum was in the Air Force in Italy during World War II, by the way. He was especially happy there while demonstrating his unflagging virility to prostitutes. So it was also with John Yossarian, the hero of Catch-22, whose present whereabouts are unknown.\nThere will be a molasses-like cautiousness about accepting this book as an important one. It took more than a year for Catch-22 to gather a band of enthusiasts. I myself was cautious about that book. I am cautious again.\nThe uneasiness which many people will feel about liking Something Happened has roots which are deep. It is no casual thing to swallow a book by Joseph Heller, for he is, whether he intends to be or not, a maker of myths. (One way to do this, surely, is to be the final and most brilliant teller of an oft-told tale.) Catch-22 is now the dominant myth about Americans in the war against fascism. Something Happened, if swallowed, could become the dominant myth about the middle-class veterans who came home from that war to become heads of nuclear families. The proposed myth has it that those families were pathetically vulnerable and suffocating. It says that the heads of them commonly took jobs which were vaguely dishonorable or at least stultifying, in order to make as much money as they could for their little families, and they used that money in futile attempts to buy safety and happiness. The proposed myth says that they lost their dignity and their will to live in the process.\nIt says they are hideously tired now.\nTo accept a new myth about ourselves is to simplify our memories\u2014and to place our stamp of approval on what might become an epitaph for our era in the shorthand of history. This, in my opinion, is why critics often condemn our most significant books and poems and plays when they first appear, while praising feebler creations. The birth of a new myth fills them with primitive dread, for myths are so effective.\nWell\u2014I have now suppressed my own dread. I have thought dispassionately about Something Happened and I am now content to have it shown to future generations as a spooky sort of summary of what my generation of nebulously clever white people experienced, and what we, within the cage of those experiences, then did with our lives.\nAnd I am counting on a backlash. I expect younger readers to love Robert Slocum\u2014on the grounds that he couldn\u2019t possibly be as morally repellent and socially useless as he claims to be.", 0.12386363636363637], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["hostetter", 0.2091540057919891], ["amy", 0.19514274701789938], ["lovable", 0.17125776083562486], ["ghost", 0.11107497272051206], ["loved", 0.10004378888735539], ["hurt", 0.06473070091175599], ["soften", 0.05708592027854161], ["expect", 0.05708592027854161], ["muscles", 0.05708592027854161], ["homely", 0.05708592027854161], ["grin", 0.05708592027854161], ["stark", 0.05708592027854161], ["austere", 0.05708592027854161], ["lonesome", 0.05708592027854161], ["accurate", 0.04994007305627413], ["overwhelmed", 0.04994007305627413], ["firm", 0.04994007305627413], ["tightened", 0.04994007305627413], ["knife", 0.04994007305627413], ["trip", 0.045760020395365225], ["cheeks", 0.045760020395365225], ["sadly", 0.045760020395365225], ["straightened", 0.042794225834006654], ["lap", 0.042794225834006654], ["colored", 0.042794225834006654], ["mercy", 0.040493776851385936], ["face", 0.03971992483246004], ["love", 0.039170064067879394], ["throat", 0.038614173173097746], ["expected", 0.038614173173097746], ["pride", 0.038614173173097746], ["lines", 0.038614173173097746], ["fast", 0.03702499090683735], ["pity", 0.03702499090683735], ["woman", 0.03662132270773143], ["surprised", 0.03564837861173918], ["police", 0.03443412051218883], ["slowly", 0.03443412051218883], ["friends", 0.03443412051218883], ["hair", 0.03443412051218883], ["moved", 0.03334792962911846], ["worked", 0.03334792962911846], ["sign", 0.03334792962911846], ["thought", 0.03270289790591978], ["crazy", 0.032365350455877996], ["filled", 0.03146832595083027], ["fingers", 0.029879143684569873], ["tears", 0.028502531389471706], ["looked", 0.028421673889873496], ["dear", 0.027877535288271343], ["moment", 0.027877535288271343], ["turn", 0.027877535288271343], ["held", 0.02728827328992136], ["brought", 0.026730879256207173], ["beautiful", 0.026202082406850985], ["lot", 0.025699091023660966], ["feel", 0.024761237640096773], ["white", 0.02432247872856279], ["full", 0.023901633424230267], ["shook", 0.023497296175227365], ["dead", 0.02310822062901245], ["heard", 0.02310822062901245], ["hands", 0.022733296462302398], ["wouldn", 0.022022029745942074], ["hand", 0.020731688066003867], ["things", 0.020432847479681677], ["will", 0.02014242606765388], ["people", 0.018073656011343045], ["eyes", 0.017841977085033163], ["head", 0.017841977085033163], ["wife", 0.01739367696194307], ["life", 0.013287000257414203], ["man", 0.009609938979695311]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWell, I did,\u201d said Amy, \u201cand I thought the least I could expect was to be alone.

She got them by doing what Fred Rosewater had so often lusted weakly to do\u2014by answering raunchy ads in The American Investigator.\nLarge feet now intruded into her childish world on the news store floor. They were the feet of Fred Rosewater.\nLila did not conceal her red-hot books. She went on reading, as though The Tropic of Cancer were Heidi:\nThe trunk is open and her things are lying around everywhere just as before. She lies down on the bed with her clothes on. Once, twice, three times, four times... I'm afraid she'll go mad... in bed, under the blankets, how good to feel her body again! But for how long? Will it last this time? Already I have a presentiment that it won't.\nLila and Fred often met between the books and magazines. Fred never asked her what she was reading. And she knew he would do what he always did\u2014would look with sad hunger at the covers of girly magazines, then pick up and open something as fat and domestic as Better Homes and Gardens. This is precisely what he did now.\n\"I guess my wife is out to lunch with your Mummy again,\" said Fred.\n\"I guess she is,\" said Lila. That ended the conversation, but Lila continued to think about Fred. She was on level with the Rosewater shins. She thought about them. Whenever she saw Fred in shorts or a bathing suit, his shins were covered with scars and scabs, as though he had been kicked and kicked and kicked every day of his life. Lila thought that maybe it was a vitamin deficiency that made Fred's shins look like that, or mange.\nFred's gory shins were victims of his wife's interior decorating scheme, which called for an almost schizophrenic use of little tables, dozens of them all through the house. Each little table had its own ashtray and dish of dusty after-dinner mints, although the Rosewaters never entertained. And Caroline was forever rearranging the tables, as though for this kind of party one day and another the next. So poor Fred was forever barking his shins on the tables.\nOne time Fred had had a deep cut on his chin that required eleven stitches. That fall hadn't been caused by all the little tables. It had been caused by an object that Caroline never put away.

They would die penniless.\nSo I am not the first Harvard man who had to be supported by his wife.\nPeace.\nSarah said to me at the Arapahoe that she was sorry to be so depressing, that she knew we were supposed to have fun. She said she would really try to have fun.\nIt was then that the waiter, shepherded by the owner, delivered the first course, specified by Mr. McCone in Cleveland, so far away. It was a half-dozen Cotuit oysters for each of us. I had never eaten an oyster before.\n\u201cBon app\u00e9tit!\u201d said the owner. I was thrilled. I had never had anybody say that to me before. I was so pleased to understand something in French without the help of an interpreter. I had studied French for four years in a Cleveland public high school, by the way, but I never found anyone who spoke the dialect I learned out there. It may have been French as it was spoken by Iroquois mercenaries in the French and Indian War.\nNow the Gypsy violinist came to our table. He played with all possible hypocrisy and brilliance, in the frenzied expectation of a tip. I remembered that Mr. McCone had told me to tip lavishly. I had not so far tipped anyone. So I got out my billfold surreptitiously while the music was still going on, and I took from it what I thought was a one-dollar bill. A common laborer in those days would have worked ten hours for a dollar. I was about to make a lavish tip. Fifty cents would have put me quite high up in the spendthrift class. I wadded up the bill in my right hand, so as to tip with the quick grace of a magician when the music stopped.\nThe trouble was this: It wasn\u2019t a one-dollar bill. It was a twenty-dollar bill.\nI blame Sarah somewhat for this sensational mistake. While I was taking the money from the billfold, she was satirizing sexual love again, pretending that the music was filling her with lust. She undid my necktie, which I would be unable to retie. It had been tied by the mother of a friend with whom I was staying. Sarah kissed the tips of two of her fingers passionately, and then pressed those fingers to my white collar, leaving a smear of lipstick there.\nNow the music stopped. I smiled my thanks.

same saloon Paul had visited for the whisky. Paul, with uncomfortable memories of the place, wanted to go somewhere else, but Finnerty was already out of the car and on his way in.\nGratefully, Paul saw that the street and saloon were almost deserted, so there was a good chance he wouldn\u2019t see any of the people who\u2019d watched his confusion the day before. No hydrants were going, but from far away, from the direction of Edison Park, came faint band music\u2014a clue as to where everyone might be.\n\u201cHey, your headlamp\u2019s busted,\u201d said a man, peering through the doorway of the saloon.\nPaul passed him quickly, without getting a good look at him. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nOnly when he\u2019d overtaken Finnerty in the damp twilight of the inside did he turn for another look at the man\u2014at his short, broad back. The man\u2019s neck was thick and red, and glinting behind his ears were the hooks of steel spectacles. It was the same man, Paul realized, the same man who had been sitting by Rudy Hertz\u2014the man whose son had just turned eighteen. Paul remembered that he had promised this man, in the panic of the moment, to speak to Matheson, the placement director, about the son. Perhaps he hadn\u2019t recognized Paul. Paul slid into a booth with Finnerty, in the darkest corner of the room.\nThe man turned and smiled, his eyes lost behind the milky, thick lenses of his glasses. \u201cYou\u2019re entirely welcome, Doctor Proteus,\u201d he called. \u201cIt isn\u2019t often that anyone can do a favor for anyone in your position.\u201d\nPaul pretended he hadn\u2019t heard, and turned his attention to Finnerty, who dug a spoon around and around and around in a sugar bowl. Some of the white grains spilled over, and Finnerty absently drew the mathematical symbol for infinity in them with the tip of his finger.\n\u201cFunny what I expected from this reunion, what I guess everybody expects from affectionate reunions. I thought seeing you would somehow clear up all sorts of problems, get me thinking straight,\u201d said Finnerty. He had a candor about his few emotional attachments that Paul found disquieting. He used words to describe his feelings that Paul could never bring himself to use when speaking of a friend: love, affection, and other words generally consigned to young and inexperienced lovers. It wasn\u2019t homosexual; it was an archaic expression of friendship by an undisciplined man in an age when most men seemed in mortal fear of being mistaken for pansies for even a split second.\n\u201cI guess I looked forward to some sort of rebirth too,\u201d said Paul.\n\u201cBut you find out quick enough that old friends are old friends, and nothing more\u2014no wiser, no more help than anyone else. Well, what the hell, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not damned pleased to see you again.\u201d", 0.04980158730158729], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["harve", 0.11746989098604634], ["moving", 0.07381666311825759], ["ilium", 0.057184062875236655], ["clear", 0.053916286187250376], ["car", 0.05363610807422821], ["face", 0.05363610807422821], ["city", 0.047214383573892287], ["planning", 0.04598777196134458], ["winning", 0.04598777196134458], ["shouting", 0.04598777196134458], ["livid", 0.04598777196134458], ["doorways", 0.04598777196134458], ["raffish", 0.04598777196134458], ["ducking", 0.04598777196134458], ["sooty", 0.04598777196134458], ["eluding", 0.04598777196134458], ["escape", 0.04598777196134458], ["childish", 0.04598777196134458], ["outwitting", 0.04598777196134458], ["meanings", 0.04598777196134458], ["crouched", 0.04598777196134458], ["exciting", 0.04598777196134458], ["filth", 0.04598777196134458], ["infantry", 0.04598777196134458], ["flight", 0.04598777196134458], ["querulousness", 0.04598777196134458], ["cunning", 0.04598777196134458], ["slovenly", 0.04598777196134458], ["flung", 0.04598777196134458], ["decaying", 0.04598777196134458], ["breeze", 0.04598777196134458], ["inconceivably", 0.04598777196134458], ["destruction", 0.04598777196134458], ["demoralized", 0.04598777196134458], ["floodlight", 0.040259282865807836], ["feeble", 0.040259282865807836], ["crawled", 0.040259282865807836], ["hunt", 0.040259282865807836], ["glare", 0.040259282865807836], ["enemies", 0.040259282865807836], ["sue", 0.040259282865807836], ["rotten", 0.040259282865807836], ["guns", 0.040259282865807836], ["fantastic", 0.040259282865807836], ["hunters", 0.040259282865807836], ["wits", 0.040259282865807836], ["blaming", 0.040259282865807836], ["tumbled", 0.040259282865807836], ["evil", 0.040259282865807836], ["yell", 0.040259282865807836], ["carefully", 0.036908331559128794], ["prison", 0.036908331559128794], ["scout", 0.036908331559128794], ["scuttled", 0.036908331559128794], ["hire", 0.036908331559128794], ["policewoman", 0.036908331559128794], ["peered", 0.0345307937702711], ["freedom", 0.0345307937702711], ["image", 0.0345307937702711], ["newspaper", 0.0345307937702711], ["pure", 0.0345307937702711], ["buildings", 0.0345307937702711], ["night", 0.033209460261707104], ["shadows", 0.03268663218916193], ["shocked", 0.03268663218916193], ["realized", 0.031179842463592053], ["sounded", 0.031179842463592053], ["bring", 0.029905869903036203], ["listened", 0.029905869903036203], ["free", 0.029905869903036203], ["walk", 0.029905869903036203], ["seemingly", 0.02880230467473436], ["walls", 0.02880230467473436], ["marvelous", 0.02880230467473436], ["wind", 0.02880230467473436], ["foolish", 0.027828891156913012], ["loud", 0.027828891156913012], ["remembered", 0.026958143093625188], ["lawyer", 0.02617045565722581], ["lights", 0.02617045565722581], ["laugh", 0.02617045565722581], ["state", 0.025451353368055315], ["moved", 0.024789843387282285], ["lay", 0.024789843387282285], ["blue", 0.02417738080749946], ["felt", 0.02417738080749946], ["friend", 0.023607191786946143], ["began", 0.023607191786946143], ["friends", 0.02307381557919762], ["best", 0.022572785646830393], ["won", 0.02210040206137627], ["person", 0.02122965399808845], ["men", 0.020441966561689073], ["coming", 0.020441966561689073], ["wanted", 0.019385492416979278], ["claire", 0.018749450754697226], ["police", 0.01760771242014502], ["find", 0.017345326483660883], ["heard", 0.016844296551293655], ["life", 0.015097940405283679], ["luby", 0.013823967844727825], ["head", 0.012430391708894829]], "sentiment": ["Guns had gone off, seemingly right by his head.\nNow men were shouting in the night, and Harve lay under the car.\nOne clear image came to Harve from his fantastic flight\u2014and only one. He remembered the face of the policewoman, the first person between him and freedom. Harve had flung her into the glare of the floodlight, had seen her livid, shocked face.\nAnd that was the only face he\u2019d seen.\nThe hunt for Harve\u2014what Harve heard of it\u2014sounded foolish, slovenly, demoralized. When Harve got his wind and his wits back, he felt marvelous. He wanted to laugh out loud and yell. He had won so far, and he would go on winning. He would get to the State Police. He would bring them back to Ilium to free Claire.\nAfter that, Harve would hire the best lawyer he could find, clear himself, put Luby in prison, and sue the rotten city of Ilium for a blue million.\nHarve peered out from under the car. His hunters were not coming toward him. They were moving away, blaming each other with childish querulousness for having let him escape.\nHarve crawled out from under the car, crouched, listened.

It covered only the second semester, and so missed the episode in the sculpture studio.

He didn\u2019t miss a thing Zuzu and I did during the second semester. There was only 1 misunderstood incident: when I went up into the loft of the stable, where the Lutz Carillon had been stored before there was a tower and where Tex Johnson was crucified 2 years ago. I went up with the aunt of a student. She was an architect who wanted to see the pegged post-and-beam joinery up there. The operative assumed we made love up there. We hadn\u2019t.\nWe made love much later that afternoon, in a toolshed by the stable, in the shadow of Musket Mountain when the Sun goes down.\nI WASN\u2019T TO see the contents of Wilder\u2019s folder for another 10 minutes or so. Wilder and a couple of others wanted to go on discussing what really bothered them about me, which was what I had been doing, supposedly, to the students\u2019 minds.

For starters, the third millennium, as countless people had pointed out, would not begin until January first, 2001. Planetarily speaking, the new year was already six hours old when our child was born, since it had begun that much earlier at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, where time begins. Never mind that the numbering of years since the birth of Christ could only be approximate. The datum was so obscure. And who can say in which minute a child was born? When its head appeared? When all of it was outside the mother? When the umbilical cord was cut? Since there were many valuable prizes to be given to the city\u2019s first baby of 2000, and its parents, and the chief physician in attendance, it was agreed well in advance of the contest that severing the cord should not count, since the moment could be delayed past the crucial midnight. There might be doctors all over the city with their eyes on the clock and their scissors poised, and of course with witnesses present, watching the scissors, watching the clock. The winning doctor would get an all-expense-paid vacation on one of the few islands where a tourist could still feel fairly secure, which was Bermuda. A battalion of British paratroops was stationed there. Understandably, doctors might be tempted to fudge the birthtime, given the opportunity.\nNo matter what the criteria, defining the moment of birth was a lot less controversial than declaring when a fertilized ovum was a human being in the mother\u2019s womb. For the purpose of the contest, the moment of birth was the moment when the baby\u2019s eyes or eyelids were first bathed in light from the outside world, when they could first be seen by the witnesses. So the baby, which was the case with ours, would still be partly inside the mother. If she had been a breech-birth, of course, the eyes would have been almost the last things to appear. And here comes the most nonsensical aspect of the contest we won: If she had been a breech-birth, or had Down\u2019s syndrome or spina bifida or been a crack baby or an AIDS baby or whatever, she surely would have been disqualified for the prizes on some supposed technicality having to do with timing rather than, or so the judges would have said, her variations from so-called norms. She was, after all, supposed to symbolize how healthy and delightful the next thousand years were supposed to be. One guarantee by the judges was that race and religion and national origin of the parents could not possibly skew their deliberations. And it is true that I am a native American Black, and my wife, while classified as white, was born in Cuba. But it surely did not hurt that I was head of the Sociology Department at Columbia University, or that my wife was a physical therapist at New York Hospital. I am certain that our baby won over several other candidates, including a newborn boy found in a trashcan in Brooklyn, because we were middle class.", 0.09171376463043128], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
