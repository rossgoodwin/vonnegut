Somehow, the subject never came up.\nIf I could write another pretty good book, Harry, I would. The trouble seems to be that I\u2019m a compulsive, irrational writer, rarely on top of the creative process, but that my id, or whatever it is that Hemingway and Faulkner get in touch with way down deep, down among the dead men, isn\u2019t a very interesting one\u2014not even to me.\nI\u2019m going to stay away from New York from now on. That saloon around the corner from Scribner\u2019s always makes me feel like the dullest bastard on earth, without even dilettante status in the arts. I\u2019ll come back when Bennett Cerf taps me, and not before.\nI\u2019ve started several books since the last one, and they\u2019ve all poohed out. If I got a grip on myself, made myself be a little soldier about them, I suppose I could finish them all. But that\u2019s fetishism, I think, writing books to write books.\nRight now I\u2019m working on a novella that pleases me and will be finished in about a week. But it\u2019s a little thing, too little for a book. Finishing it is about as far ahead as I can see.\nThanks for your encouragement and interest. I appreciate Scribner\u2019s investment in me, and hope with the enthusiasm of a vested interest that there will be a handsome payoff. However, 1953 looks like the year of the crashing apathy.\nAnyway, I keep trying, and if I get something past page 100, you\u2019ll be the first to know.

from his unfinished memoir My Ten Years on Automatic Pilot:\n\u201cThe timequake of 2001 was a cosmic charley horse in the sinews of Destiny. At what was in New York City 2:27 p.m. on February 13th of that year, the Universe suffered a crisis in self-confidence. Should it go on expanding indefinitely? What was the point?\n\u201cIt fibrillated with indecision. Maybe it should have a family reunion back where it all began, and then make a great big BANG again.\n\u201cIt suddenly shrunk ten years. It zapped me and everybody else back to February 17th, 1991, what was for me 7:51 a.m., and a line outside a blood bank in San Diego, California.\n\u201cFor reasons best known to itself, though, the Universe canceled the family reunion, for the nonce at least. It resumed expansion. Which faction, if any, cast the deciding votes on whether to expand or shrink, I cannot say. Despite my having lived for eighty-four years, or ninety-four, if you want to count the rerun, many questions about the Universe remain for me unanswered.\n\u201cThat the rerun lasted ten years, short a mere four days, some are saying now, is proof that there is a God, and that He is on the Decimal System. He has ten fingers and ten toes, just as we do, they say, and uses them when He does arithmetic.\n\u201cI have my doubts. I can\u2019t help it. That\u2019s the way I am. Even if my father, the ornithologist Professor Raymond Trout of Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, hadn\u2019t murdered my mother, a housewife and poet, I believe I would have been that way. Then again, I have never made a serious study of the different religions, and so am unqualified to comment. About all I know for certain is that devout Muslims do not believe in Santa Claus.\u201d\nOn the first of the two Christmas Eves, 2000, the still religious African-American armed guard Dudley Prince thought Trout\u2019s \u201cThe Sisters B-36\u201d just might be a message for the Academy from God Himself. What happened to the planet Booboo, after all, wasn\u2019t a whole lot different from what seemed to be happening to his own planet, and especially to his employers, what was left of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, way-the-hell-and-gone up on West 155th Street, two doors west of Broadway.\nTrout got to know Prince, just as he got to know Monica Pepper and me, after the rerun ended and free will had kicked in again.

He knew where he was going. He had a flashlight and a map. Nancy had to go before him along the narrow catwalk, her own shadow dancing mockingly in the lead. She tried to guess where they were, relative to the real world above. She guessed correctly when they passed under the Howard Johnson\u2019s, guessed from noises she heard. The machinery that processed and served the food there was silent. But, so people wouldn\u2019t feel too lonesome when eating there, the designers had provided sound effects for the kitchen. It was these Nancy heard\u2014a tape recording of the clashing of silverware and the laughter of Negroes and Puerto Ricans.\nAfter that she was lost. Billy had very little to say to her other than \"Right,\" or, \"Left,\" or \"Don\u2019t try anything funny, Juno, or I\u2019ll blow your great big fucking head off.\"\nOnly once did they have anything resembling a conversation. Billy began it, and ended it, too. \"What in hell is a girl with hips like yours doing selling death?\" he asked her from behind.\nShe dared to stop. \"I can answer that,\" she told him. She was confident that she could give him an answer that would shrivel him like napalm.\nBut he gave her a shove, offered to blow her fucking head off again.\n\"You don\u2019t even want to hear my answer,\" she taunted him. \"You\u2019re afraid to hear it.\"\n\"I never listen to a woman till the pills wear off,\" sneered Billy.

They were working night and day over there. And even at lunchtime of Mother\u2019s Day, the studio trembled as tanks rumbled by outside. The tanks were on the way to the proving ground which used to be John Fortune\u2019s dairy farm, and which would later become the Mar\u00edtimo Brother\u2019s jumble of little shitboxes known as Avondale.\nMrs. Roosevelt knew that Felix had just left for the Army, and she prayed that he would be safe. She said that the hardest part of her husband\u2019s job was that there was no way to win a battle without many persons being injured or killed.\nLike Father, she assumed, because I was so tall, that I must be about sixteen. Anyway, she guessed it was touch-and-go whether I myself would be drafted by and by. She certainly hoped not.\nFor my own part, I hoped that my voice changed before then.\nShe said that there would be a wonderful new world when the war was won. Everybody who needed food or medicine would get it, and people could say anything they wanted, and could choose any religion that appealed to them. Leaders wouldn\u2019t dare to be unjust anymore, since all the other countries would gang up on them. For this reason, there could never be another Hitler.

There was dumb luck again. Nothing else would have made him open up.\nPeople helping me with my research later, incidentally, tell me that the name of Iona Potapov was a familiar one in European chess tournaments in the early thirties. He actually beat the Grand Master Tartakover in Rotterdam in 1931.\nWhen he opened up, I saw that he was a painter. There was an easel in the middle of his living room with a fresh canvas on it, and there were stunning paintings by him on every wall.\nWhen I talk about Kraft, alias Potapov, I\u2019m a lot more comfortable than when I talk about Wirtanen, alias God-knows-what. Wirtanen has left no more of a trail than an inchworm crossing a billiard table. Evidences of Kraft are everywhere. At this very moment, I\u2019m told, Kraft\u2019s paintings are bringing as much as ten thousand dollars apiece in New York.\nI have at hand a clipping from the New York Herald Tribune of March third, about two weeks ago, in which a critic says of Kraft as a painter:\nHere at last is a capable and grateful heir to the fantastic inventiveness and experimentation in painting during the past hundred years. Aristotle is said to have been the last man to understand the whole of his culture. George Kraft is surely the first man to understand the whole of modern art\u2014to understand it in his sinews and bones.\nWith incredible grace and firmness he combines the visions of a score of warring schools of painting, past and present. He thrills and humbles us with harmony, seems to say to us, \u201cIf you want another Renaissance, this is what the paintings expressing its spirit will look like.\u201d\nGeorge Kraft, alias Iona Potapov, is being permitted to continue his remarkable art career in the Federal Penitentiary at Fort Leavenworth. We all might well reflect, along, no doubt, with Kraft-Potapov himself, on how summarily his career would have been crushed in a prison in his native Russia.\nWell\u2014when Kraft opened his door for me, I knew his paintings were good. I didn\u2019t know they were that good. I suspect that the review above was written by a pansy full of brandy Alexanders.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know I had a painter living underneath me,\u201d I said to Kraft.", 0.1864801864801865], "title": "Mother Night"}, "we-are-what-we-pretend-to-be": {"tfidf": [["heartbreaks", 0.10111931843438797], ["unhappy", 0.08554297729820942], ["will", 0.05757006047020513], ["face", 0.050699238093582275], ["raging", 0.050559659217193985], ["scattered", 0.050559659217193985], ["pitiable", 0.050559659217193985], ["flatly", 0.050559659217193985], ["stalls", 0.050559659217193985], ["tender", 0.050559659217193985], ["forehead", 0.050559659217193985], ["unspoken", 0.050559659217193985], ["pressure", 0.050559659217193985], ["misty", 0.050559659217193985], ["painful", 0.050559659217193985], ["reluctantly", 0.050559659217193985], ["finds", 0.050559659217193985], ["cough", 0.04277148864910471], ["risen", 0.04277148864910471], ["mad", 0.04277148864910471], ["haley", 0.03829105871500714], ["angry", 0.03821570091755231], ["faint", 0.03821570091755231], ["seemingly", 0.03821570091755231], ["murmured", 0.03821570091755231], ["dangerous", 0.03821570091755231], ["thinks", 0.03498331808101544], ["bear", 0.03498331808101544], ["ear", 0.03498331808101544], ["terribly", 0.03498331808101544], ["distant", 0.03498331808101544], ["remained", 0.03247608716737264], ["knees", 0.03247608716737264], ["afraid", 0.03247608716737264], ["moon", 0.03247608716737264], ["voice", 0.03165769026903256], ["idea", 0.030427530349463033], ["opened", 0.030427530349463033], ["thoughts", 0.030427530349463033], ["whispered", 0.030427530349463033], ["darkness", 0.030427530349463033], ["hope", 0.02919829521888568], ["lips", 0.028695500239044405], ["loft", 0.02719514751292617], ["beneath", 0.02719514751292617], ["coming", 0.02587174261791063], ["watched", 0.02587174261791063], ["hurt", 0.02587174261791063], ["leave", 0.02587174261791063], ["won", 0.024687916599283367], ["understand", 0.024687916599283367], ["sound", 0.024687916599283367], ["heaven", 0.024687916599283367], ["minute", 0.023617015702605555], ["bed", 0.023617015702605555], ["things", 0.020907329670955127], ["window", 0.020132128867730956], ["sunroom", 0.019406976944836896], ["barn", 0.019406976944836896], ["general", 0.01914552935750357], ["better", 0.018725801418809536], ["felt", 0.018725801418809536], ["wanted", 0.018725801418809536], ["light", 0.018725801418809536], ["talk", 0.018725801418809536], ["high", 0.01582884513451628], ["turned", 0.014392515117551283], ["banghart", 0.013951832947289697], ["head", 0.013119159102865856], ["eyes", 0.011975533324102457], ["heard", 0.011618806376747623]], "sentiment": ["He opened his eyes reluctantly, looking up into the face of Hope, misty in the light from the risen moon. \u201cHow did you know I was out here?\u201d he murmured.\n\u201cI watched you through the sunroom window and saw you head for the barn.

He thought that he might be able to ditch it in the heat outside, so he crossed the lobby, heedless of *Siegfried von Kleist\u2019s calls from the bar. *Von Kleist was asking him what was the matter, where was he going, and so on. Ortiz was the hotel\u2019s best employee, the most loyal and resourceful and uniformly cheerful one, and *von Kleist really needed him.\nHere is why the hotel manager had no children, incidentally, although he was heterosexual and his sperm looked fine under a microscope and so on: There was a fifty-fifty chance that he was a carrier of an inherited and incurable disease of the brain, unknown in the present day, called Huntington\u2019s chorea. Back then, Huntington\u2019s chorea was one of the thousand most common diseases which Mandarax could diagnose.\nIt is a matter of pure, gambling-casino luck that there are no carriers of Huntington\u2019s chorea today. It was the same dumb luck which had made *Siegfried von Kleist a possible carrier back then. His father had learned that he was a carrier only in middle life, after he had reproduced twice.\nAnd that meant, of course, that *Siegfried\u2019s taller and older and more glamorous brother, Adolf, the captain of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, might also be a carrier. So *Siegfried, who was about to die without issue, and Adolf, who would eventually become the common sire of the entire human race, had both, for admirably unselfish reasons, declined to engage in biologically significant copulation a million years ago.\n*Siegfried and Adolf kept it a secret that they might have this defect in their genes. That secrecy spared them personal embarrassment, surely\u2014but it protected all their relatives, too. If it had been generally known that the brothers might transmit Huntington\u2019s chorea to their offspring, all the von Kleists would likely have found it difficult to make good marriages, even though there was no chance that they, too, were carriers.\nThe thing was: The disease, if they had it, had come to the brothers through their paternal grandmother, who was the second wife of their paternal grandfather, and who had only one child\u2014their father, the Ecuadorian sculptor and architect, Sebastian von Kleist.\nHow bad a defect was it? Well\u2014it was certainly a lot worse than having a child all covered with fur.\nIn fact, of all the horrible diseases known to Mandarax, Huntington\u2019s chorea may have been the worst. It was surely the most treacherous, the nastiest, of all surprises. It usually lay in ambush, and undetectable by any known test, until the wretch who had inherited it was well into his or her adult years. The father of the brothers, for example, led an unclouded and productive life until he was fifty-four\u2014at which time he began to dance involuntarily, and to see things which weren\u2019t there. And then he killed his wife, a fact which was hushed up. The murder was reported to the police, and so treated by them, as a household accident.\nSo these two brothers had been expecting to go crazy at any moment, to start dancing and hallucinating, for twenty-five years now. Each one had a fifty-fifty chance of doing that. If either one went crazy, that would be proof that he could pass on the defect to yet another generation. If either one became an old, old man without going crazy, that would be proof that he was not a carrier, nor would any of his descendants be carriers, either. It would turn out that he might have reproduced with impunity.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", -0.003034547152194198], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["pants", 0.09359912907780607], ["mussolini", 0.05513328259757231], ["suits", 0.046799564538903035], ["stairs", 0.037969664149604364], ["gregory", 0.03580638998020117], ["italian", 0.03462744422008219], ["pictures", 0.034430015185061474], ["braid", 0.03365097916393624], ["spread", 0.03365097916393624], ["flew", 0.03365097916393624], ["refectory", 0.03365097916393624], ["alpine", 0.03365097916393624], ["decimal", 0.03365097916393624], ["piping", 0.03365097916393624], ["button", 0.03365097916393624], ["pleating", 0.03365097916393624], ["imported", 0.03365097916393624], ["infuriated", 0.03365097916393624], ["leader", 0.03365097916393624], ["ambled", 0.03365097916393624], ["reborn", 0.03365097916393624], ["quality", 0.03365097916393624], ["motives", 0.03365097916393624], ["decorations", 0.03365097916393624], ["amiability", 0.03365097916393624], ["abashing", 0.03365097916393624], ["shorter", 0.03365097916393624], ["sheltered", 0.03365097916393624], ["mountaintop", 0.03365097916393624], ["brass", 0.03365097916393624], ["marilee", 0.032506255885490894], ["touched", 0.0292360289692869], ["scrawny", 0.0292360289692869], ["leather", 0.0292360289692869], ["shove", 0.0292360289692869], ["con", 0.0292360289692869], ["troops", 0.0292360289692869], ["depicted", 0.0292360289692869], ["legs", 0.0292360289692869], ["recall", 0.0292360289692869], ["tessa", 0.0292360289692869], ["waist", 0.0292360289692869], ["misplaced", 0.0292360289692869], ["point", 0.029139763760305703], ["studio", 0.028518233006554976], ["closely", 0.02665344866286547], ["colors", 0.02665344866286547], ["supply", 0.02665344866286547], ["roebuck", 0.02665344866286547], ["sears", 0.02665344866286547], ["nature", 0.02665344866286547], ["1932", 0.02665344866286547], ["backwards", 0.02665344866286547], ["thanked", 0.02665344866286547], ["dictator", 0.02665344866286547], ["pushed", 0.02665344866286547], ["obvious", 0.02665344866286547], ["castor", 0.02665344866286547], ["measured", 0.02665344866286547], ["sunrise", 0.02665344866286547], ["coat", 0.02665344866286547], ["concerned", 0.02482107877463757], ["rage", 0.02482107877463757], ["sending", 0.02482107877463757], ["afford", 0.02482107877463757], ["happier", 0.02482107877463757], ["looked", 0.02355689839812538], ["portrait", 0.023399782269451518], ["brilliant", 0.023399782269451518], ["expensive", 0.023399782269451518], ["hoped", 0.023399782269451518], ["bet", 0.023399782269451518], ["oil", 0.023399782269451518], ["uniform", 0.02223849846821614], ["attention", 0.02223849846821614], ["ordered", 0.02223849846821614], ["strange", 0.02223849846821614], ["send", 0.02125664700434825], ["enemies", 0.02125664700434825], ["received", 0.02125664700434825], ["fell", 0.020406128579988234], ["short", 0.020406128579988234], ["gift", 0.019655918161794707], ["drink", 0.019655918161794707], ["painted", 0.019655918161794707], ["portomaggiore", 0.018984832074802182], ["egypt", 0.018984832074802182], ["letter", 0.018984832074802182], ["perfect", 0.018377760865857438], ["california", 0.018377760865857438], ["suit", 0.018377760865857438], ["uniforms", 0.018377760865857438], ["bit", 0.017823548273566803], ["reason", 0.017823548273566803], ["general", 0.017823548273566803], ["shot", 0.017313722110041094], ["table", 0.017313722110041094], ["believed", 0.017313722110041094], ["arrived", 0.017313722110041094], ["materials", 0.017313722110041094], ["father", 0.016967643441484857], ["paper", 0.01684169680969892], ["earth", 0.01684169680969892], ["afternoon", 0.01684169680969892], ["moment", 0.016402251768380754], ["wearing", 0.0159911783853389], ["british", 0.0159911783853389], ["exactly", 0.0159911783853389], ["dan", 0.015576569658491328], ["canvas", 0.015240967967145377], ["middle", 0.015240967967145377], ["serious", 0.015240967967145377], ["boy", 0.014896590761602218], ["mine", 0.014896590761602218], ["incidentally", 0.014259116503277488], ["couldn", 0.013962810671208107], ["man", 0.013738995023528948], ["killed", 0.013679678425534006], ["room", 0.012658387660723948], ["artist", 0.012426746615049583], ["dead", 0.012203235023894999], ["years", 0.011802482828641997], ["night", 0.011380230364786678], ["paint", 0.011190084102686798], ["york", 0.0099976538983037], ["knew", 0.0099976538983037], ["time", 0.009425591674751396], ["wasn", 0.008993647884268138], ["thought", 0.008126563971372723], ["art", 0.008011796420400251], ["war", 0.006236551818686743]], "sentiment": ["Only after the war did Marilee, reborn as the Con-tessa Portomaggiore, tell me that I was the reason she had been pushed down the stairs back in 1932. She had sheltered me from that abashing information, and so, from very different motives, certainly, had Dan Gregory.\nBut she came up to his studio the night he nearly killed her, to get him to give his serious attention to pictures of mine for the very first time. In all the years I had been sending pictures to New York, he had never looked at one. Marilee thought that this time might be different, since Gregory was happier than she had ever seen him. Why? He had that afternoon received a letter of thanks from the man he believed to be the most brilliant leader on earth, the Italian dictator Mussolini, the man who made his enemies drink castor oil.\nMussolini had thanked him for a portrait of himself which Gregory had painted as a gift. Mussolini was depicted as a general of Alpine troops on a mountaintop at sunrise, and you can bet that every bit of leather and piping and braid and brass and pleating, and all the decorations, were exactly as they should be. Nobody could paint uniforms like Dan Gregory.\nGregory would be shot dead in Egypt eight years later, incidentally, by the British, while wearing an Italian uniform.\nBut the point is this: Marilee spread out my pictures on a refectory table in his studio, and he knew what they were. As she had hoped, he ambled over to them with all possible amiability. The moment he looked at them closely, though, he flew into a rage.\nBut it wasn\u2019t the nature of my pictures which infuriated him. It was the quality of the art materials I had used. No boy artist in California could afford such expensive imported colors and paper and canvas. Marilee, obviously, had taken them from his supply room.\nSo he gave her a shove, and she fell backwards down the stairs.\nSomewhere in here I want to tell about the suit I ordered from Sears, Roebuck along with my own. Father and I measured each other up for the suits, which was strange even in itself, since I can\u2019t recall our ever having touched before.\nBut when the suits arrived, it was obvious that somebody somewhere had misplaced a decimal point where Father\u2019s pants were concerned. As short as his legs were, his pants were much shorter. As scrawny as he was around the middle, he couldn\u2019t button the pants at the waist. The coat was just perfect, though.\nSo I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about the pants.

He was my father\u2019s kid brother, a childless graduate of Harvard who was an honest life-insurance salesman in Indianapolis. He was well-read and wise. And his principal complaint about other human beings was that they so seldom noticed it when they were happy. So when we were drinking lemonade under an apple tree in the summer, say, and talking lazily about this and that, almost buzzing like honeybees, Uncle Alex would suddenly interrupt the agreeable blather to exclaim, \u201cIf this isn\u2019t nice, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\nSo I do the same now, and so do my kids and grandkids. And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, \u201cIf this isn\u2019t nice, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\nWe are not born with imagination. It has to be developed by teachers, by parents. There was a time when imagination was very important because it was the major source of entertainment. In 1892 if you were a seven-year-old, you\u2019d read a story\u2014just a very simple one\u2014about a girl whose dog had died. Doesn\u2019t that make you want to cry? Don\u2019t you know how that little girl feels? And you\u2019d read another story about a rich man slipping on a banana peel. Doesn\u2019t that make you want to laugh? And this imagination circuit is being built in your head. If you go to an art gallery, here\u2019s just a square with daubs of paint on it that haven\u2019t moved in hundreds of years. No sound comes out of it.\nThe imagination circuit is taught to respond to the most minimal of cues. A book is an arrangement of twenty-six phonetic symbols, ten numerals, and about eight punctuation marks, and people can cast their eyes over these and envision the eruption of Mount Vesuvius or the Battle of Waterloo. But it\u2019s no longer necessary for teachers and parents to build these circuits. Now there are professionally produced shows with great actors, very convincing sets, sound, music. Now there\u2019s the information highway. We don\u2019t need the circuits any more than we need to know how to ride horses. Those of us who had imagination circuits built can look in someone\u2019s face and see stories there; to everyone else, a face will just be a face.\nAnd there, I\u2019ve just used a semi-colon, which at the outset I told you never to use. It is to make a point that I did it. The point is: Rules only take us so far, even good rules.\nWho was the wisest person I ever met in my entire life? It was a man, but of course it needn\u2019t have been. It was the graphic artist Saul Steinberg, who like everybody else I know, is dead now. I could ask him anything, and six seconds would pass, and then he would give me a perfect answer, gruffly, almost a growl. He was born in Romania, in a house where, according to him, \u201cthe geese looked in the windows.\u201d\nI said, \u201cSaul, how should I feel about Picasso?\u201d\nSix seconds passed, and then he said, \u201cGod put him on Earth to show us what it\u2019s like to be really rich.\u201d\nI said, \u201cSaul, I am a novelist, and many of my friends are novelists and good ones, but when we talk I keep feeling we are in two very different businesses. What makes me feel that way?\u201d\nSix seconds passed, and then he said, \u201cIt\u2019s very simple. There are two sorts of artists, one not being in the least superior to the other. But one responds to the history of his or her art so far, and the other responds to life itself.\u201d", 0.22030612244897954], "title": "A Man without a Country"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["triage", 0.26726613938321064], ["practiced", 0.22687161955978685], ["university", 0.09692477694033261], ["operated", 0.09456546437052853], ["station", 0.09456546437052853], ["goner", 0.09456546437052853], ["plasma", 0.09456546437052853], ["tent", 0.09456546437052853], ["expiring", 0.09456546437052853], ["clearer", 0.09456546437052853], ["aid", 0.09456546437052853], ["settings", 0.09456546437052853], ["classes", 0.09456546437052853], ["doctors", 0.08261465091259844], ["preposterously", 0.08261465091259844], ["angry", 0.07562387318659561], ["snow", 0.07066383745466834], ["eleven", 0.07066383745466834], ["corpses", 0.07066383745466834], ["fifty", 0.06856170248359224], ["waste", 0.06681653484580266], ["chance", 0.06681653484580266], ["tall", 0.06681653484580266], ["survive", 0.06367305972866552], ["gather", 0.06367305972866552], ["battalion", 0.06101528938681624], ["suicide", 0.06101528938681624], ["concerned", 0.05871302399673826], ["wound", 0.05871302399673826], ["bank", 0.05871302399673826], ["iowa", 0.05871302399673826], ["lines", 0.05871302399673826], ["inside", 0.05668228200266268], ["grandchildren", 0.054865721387872574], ["glad", 0.053222442425729044], ["harvard", 0.05172224627073543], ["front", 0.05034219958670893], ["earth", 0.049064475928886145], ["private", 0.047874943661869736], ["third", 0.04571695843852481], ["planet", 0.04050521926830182], ["idea", 0.03977143281280533], ["college", 0.03711366247095605], ["better", 0.03535878843112947], ["writing", 0.033766144980594714], ["mother", 0.033766144980594714], ["class", 0.03140060840277601], ["city", 0.030538359772178402], ["people", 0.014489759212918658], ["time", 0.010642456604052976]], "sentiment": ["Or anywhere.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMy mother, who was also a suicide and who never saw even the first of her eleven grandchildren, is another one, I gather, who would not like to see her name anywhere.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAm I angry at having had triage practiced on me?

one prediction that was so deadly accurate that thinking about it even now leaves me thunderstruck.\nListen: We began with the mystery of how ancient peoples had erected the pyramids of Egypt and Mexico, and the great heads of Easter Island, and the barbaric arches of Stonehenge, without modern power sources and tools.\nWe concluded there must have been days of light gravity in olden times, when people could play tiddledy winks with huge chunks of stone.\nWe supposed that it might even be abnormal on earth for gravity to be stable for long periods of time. We predicted that at any moment gravity might become as capricious as winds and heat and cold, as blizzards and rainstorms again.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYes, and Eliza and I composed a precocious critique of the Constitution of the United States of America, too. We argued that it was as good a scheme for misery as any, since its success in keeping the common people reasonably happy and proud depended on the strength of the people themselves\u2014and yet it described no practical machinery which would tend to make the people, as opposed to their elected representatives, strong.\nWe said it was possible that the framers of the Constitution were blind to the beauty of persons who were without great wealth or powerful friends or public office, but who were nonetheless genuinely strong.\nWe thought it was more likely, though, that the framers had not noticed that it was natural, and therefore almost inevitable, that human beings in extraordinary and enduring situations should think of themselves as composing new families. Eliza and I pointed out that this happened no less in democracies than in tyrannies, since human beings were the same the wide world over, and civilized only yesterday.\nElected representatives, hence, could be expected to become members of the famous and powerful family of elected representatives\u2014which would, perfectly naturally, make them wary and squeamish and stingy with respect to all the other sorts of families which, again, perfectly naturally, subdivided mankind.\nEliza and I, thinking as halves of a single genius, proposed that the Constitution be amended so as to guarantee that every citizen, no matter how humble or crazy or incompetent or deformed, somehow be given membership in some family as covertly xenophobic and crafty as the one their public servants formed.", 0.12876670431018258], "title": "Slapstick"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["coming", 0.5839507962959005], ["yeah", 0.5168074206893669], ["shuttle", 0.422167366094085], ["penelope", 0.2638667663661177]], "sentiment": ["PENELOPE\nDid you see him?\nSHUTTLE\nYeah.\nPENELOPE\nIs he all right?\nSHUTTLE\nFar as I know.\nPENELOPE\nIs he coming home?", 0.19285714285714284], "title": "Happy Birthday, Wanda June"}, "god-bless-you-mr-rosewater": {"tfidf": [["seed", 0.207149951642197], ["predestinarian", 0.207149951642197], ["spirit", 0.17885822998668902], ["religion", 0.16230863373737622], ["parts", 0.16230863373737622], ["draw", 0.16230863373737622], ["baptist", 0.16230863373737622], ["pay", 0.13401691208186825], ["stranger", 0.13401691208186825], ["ministers", 0.1035749758210985], ["melissa", 0.1035749758210985], ["washing", 0.1035749758210985], ["sect", 0.1035749758210985], ["deadly", 0.1035749758210985], ["insist", 0.08942911499334451], ["ease", 0.08942911499334451], ["practiced", 0.08942911499334451], ["tail", 0.08115431686868811], ["caller", 0.08115431686868811], ["wash", 0.07528325416559054], ["generally", 0.07528325416559054], ["saint", 0.07528325416559054], ["southern", 0.07072930413876992], ["serious", 0.07072930413876992], ["jesus", 0.06700845604093413], ["number", 0.06113739333783654], ["happen", 0.06113739333783654], ["foot", 0.06113739333783654], ["piece", 0.05658344331101594], ["best", 0.04971666297180751], ["feet", 0.04830864518635953], ["call", 0.044587797088523715], ["kind", 0.044587797088523715], ["indiana", 0.038716734385426145], ["love", 0.0363129989638673], ["money", 0.033493604300993476], ["good", 0.02293734891127346], ["people", 0.018383398884452853], ["rosewater", 0.011516618545244425], ["eliot", 0.008402749410648159]], "sentiment": ["\"No.\"\n\"Says, 'Eliot Rosewater is a saint.

Nineteen-hundred and Forty-nine. I had just returned to Washington with my little human family. We had just moved into our brick bungalow in Chevy Chase, Maryland, with its flowering crab apple tree. It was autumn. There were tart little apples on the tree. My wife Ruth was about to make jelly out of them, as she would do every year. Where was my voice coming from, that it should have been heard by little Emil Larkin in Petoskey? From a committee room in the House of Representatives. With a brutal bouquet of radio microphones before me I was being questioned, principally by a young congressman from California named Richard M. Nixon, about my previous associations with communists, and about my present loyalty to the United States.\nNineteen-hundred and Forty-nine: Will young people of today doubt me if I aver with a straight face that congressional committees convened in treetops then, since saber-toothed tigers still dominated the ground? No. Winston Churchill was still alive. Joseph Stalin was still alive. Think of that. Harry S. Truman was President. And the Defense Department had told me, a former communist, to form and head a task force of scientists and military men. Its mission was to propose tactics for ground forces when, as seemed inevitable, small nuclear weapons became available on the battlefield.\nThe committee wished to know, and especially Mr. Nixon, if a man with my political past was to be trusted with such a sensitive job. Might I hand over our tactical schemes to the Soviet Union? Might I rig the schemes to make them impractical, so that in any battle with the Soviet Union the Soviet Union would surely win?\n\u201cYou know what I heard on that radio?\u201d said Emil Larkin.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said\u2014ever so emptily.\n\u201cI heard a man do the one thing nobody can ever forgive him for\u2014and I don\u2019t care what their politics are. I heard him do the one thing he can\u2019t ever forgive himself for, and that was to betray his best friend.\u201d\nI could not smile then at his description of what he thought he had heard, and I cannot smile at it now\u2014but it was ludicrous all the same. It was an impossibly chowder-headed abridgement of congressional hearings and civil suits and finally a criminal trial, which were spread out over two years. As a little boy listening to the radio, he could only have heard a lot of tedious talk, not much more interesting than static. It was only as a grownup, with a set of ethics based on cowboy movies, that Larkin could have decided that he had heard with utmost clarity the betrayal of a man by his best friend.\n\u201cLeland Clewes was never my best friend,\u201d I said. This was the name of the man who was ruined by my testimony, and for a while there our last names would be paired in conversations: \u201cStarbuck and Clewes\u201d\u2014like \u201cGilbert and Sullivan;\u201d like \u201cSacco and Vanzetti;\u201d like \u201cLaurel and Hardy;\u201d like \u201cLeopold and Loeb.\u201d\nI don\u2019t hear much about us anymore.\nClewes was a Yale man\u2014my age. We first met at Oxford, where I was the coxswain and he was the bowman of a winning crew at Henley. I was short. He was tall. I am still short. He is still tall. We went to work for the Department of Agriculture at the same time and were assigned adjacent cubicles. We played tennis every Sunday morning, when the weather was clement.

They wanted something little to carry for a change.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did Dr. Hoenikker say?\u201d\n\u201cIn his playful way, and all his ways were playful, Felix suggested that there might be a single grain of something\u2014even a microscopic grain\u2014that could make infinite expanses of muck, marsh, swamp, creeks, pools, quicksand, and mire as solid as this desk.\u201d\nDr. Breed banged his speckled old fist on the desk. The desk was a kidney-shaped, sea green steel affair. \u201cOne Marine could carry more than enough of the stuff to free an armored division bogged down in the Everglades.

["Paul seized them both by their arms and propelled them into the bar and in view of the dinner party. All were looking questioningly in their direction. Paul, Anita, and Shepherd smiled, and crossed the bar to the dining room, arm in arm.\n\u201cUnder the weather?\u201d said Kroner to Shepherd kindly.\n\u201cYessir. Scallops for lunch did it, I think.\u201d\nKroner nodded sympathetically and turned to the waiter. \u201cCould the boy have milk toast, do you suppose?\u201d Kroner was willing to go to any lengths to preserve harmony in his family, to give a man in a tight spot a way out. For the rest of the evening, Paul supposed, Kroner would be keeping alive\u2014as with the milk toast now\u2014the polite fiction of Shepherd\u2019s illness.\nAfter coffee and a liqueur, Paul gave a brief talk on the integration of the Ilium Works with other industry under the National Manufacturing Council fourteen years before. And then he went into the more general subject of what he called the Second Industrial Revolution. He read the talk, rather, taking pains to look up from his manuscript at regular intervals. It was, as he had told Katharine Finch in the office that afternoon, old stuff\u2014a progress report, a reaffirmation of faith in what they were doing and had done with industry. Machines were doing America\u2019s work far better than Americans had ever done it. There were better goods for more people at less cost, and who could deny that that was magnificent and gratifying? It was what everyone said when he had to make a talk.\nAt one point, Kroner raised his big hand and asked if he might make a comment. \u201cJust to sort of underline what you\u2019re saying, Paul, I\u2019d like to point out something I thought was rather interesting. One horsepower equals about twenty-two manpower\u2014big manpower. If you convert the horsepower of one of the bigger steel-mill motors into terms of manpower, you\u2019ll find that the motor does more work than the entire slave population of the United States at the time of the Civil War could do\u2014and do it twenty-four hours a day.\u201d He smiled beatifically. Kroner was the rock, the fountainhead of faith and pride for all in the Eastern Division.\n\u201cThat is an interesting figure,\u201d said Paul, searching for his place in the manuscript. \u201cAnd that, of course, simply applies to the First Industrial Revolution, where machines devalued muscle work. The second revolution, the one we\u2019re now completing, is a little tougher to express in terms of work saved. If there were some measure like horsepower in which we could express annoyance or boredom that people used to experience in routine jobs\u2014but there isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou can measure rejects, I\u2019m here to tell you,\u201d said Baer, \u201cand the darnedest, stupidest mistakes imaginable. The waste, the stoppages, the lemons! You can express it in dollars all right, dollars that went into bad workmanship.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Paul, \u201cbut I was thinking of it from the worker\u2019s point of view. The two industrial revolutions eliminated two kinds of drudgery, and I was looking for some way of estimating just how much the second revolution had relieved men of.\u201d\n\u201cI work,\u201d said Baer.

While the Japanese had taken over the operation of Athena by the time I got there, hoping to operate it at a profit, the blacked-out buses and steel boxes had been in use long before they got there. Those morbid forms of transportation became a common sight on the road to and from Rochester in maybe 1977, about 2 years after I and my little family took up residence in Scipio.\nThe only change the Japanese made in the vehicles, which was under way when I went to work over there in 1991, was to remount the old steel boxes on new Japanese trucks.\nSO IT WAS in violation of long-standing prison policy that I told Alton Darwin and other lifers all they wanted to know about the valley. I thought they were entitled to know about the great forest, which was their forest now, and the beautiful lake, which was their lake now, and the beautiful little college, which was where the music from the bells was coming from.\nAnd of course, this enriched their dreams of escaping, but what were those but what we could call in any other context the virtue hope? I never thought they would ever really get out of here and make use of the knowledge I had given them of the countryside, and neither did they.\nI USED TO do the same sort of thing in Vietnam, too, helping mortally wounded soldiers dream that they would soon be well and home again.\nWhy not?\nI AM AS sorry as anybody that Darwin and all the rest really tasted freedom. They were horrible news for themselves and everyone. A lot of them were real homicidal maniacs. Darwin wasn\u2019t 1 of those, but even as the convicts were crossing the ice to Scipio, he was giving orders as if he were an Emperor, as if the break were his idea, although he had had nothing to do with it. He hadn\u2019t known it was coming.\nThose who had actually breached the walls and opened the cells had come down from Rochester to free only 1 convict. They got him, and they were headed out of the valley and had no interest in conquering Scipio and its little army of 6 regular policemen and 3 unarmed campus cops, and an unknown number of firearms in private hands.\nALTON DARWIN WAS the first example I had ever seen of leadership in the raw. He was a man without any badges of rank, and with no previously existing organization or widely understood plan of action. He had been a modest, unremarkable man in prison. The moment he got out, though, sudden delusions of grandeur made him the only man who knew what to do next, which was to attack Scipio, where glory and riches awaited all who dared to follow him.\n\u201cFollow me!\u201d he cried, and some did. He was a sociopath, I think, in love with himself and no one else, craving action for its own sake, and indifferent to any long-term consequences, a classic Man of Destiny.", 0.03527864111197444], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["familiar", 0.09904312571239593], ["newport", 0.08729486841476974], ["agent", 0.07554661111714354], ["estate", 0.06180203118127357], ["peckham", 0.05692606385158236], ["tony", 0.049521562856197965], ["staffed", 0.049521562856197965], ["tuyl", 0.049521562856197965], ["exceptionally", 0.049521562856197965], ["paddocks", 0.049521562856197965], ["van", 0.049521562856197965], ["haggle", 0.049521562856197965], ["vaguely", 0.049521562856197965], ["irish", 0.049521562856197965], ["penny", 0.049521562856197965], ["maids", 0.049521562856197965], ["parlor", 0.049521562856197965], ["beach", 0.049521562856197965], ["overlooking", 0.049521562856197965], ["lost", 0.04382115049169284], ["furnished", 0.04364743420738487], ["stocked", 0.04364743420738487], ["faraway", 0.04364743420738487], ["cradle", 0.04364743420738487], ["vacation", 0.04364743420738487], ["polo", 0.04364743420738487], ["bus", 0.04364743420738487], ["courts", 0.04364743420738487], ["noises", 0.04364743420738487], ["feature", 0.04364743420738487], ["vintage", 0.04364743420738487], ["salary", 0.04364743420738487], ["hadn", 0.040839952755020566], ["attractive", 0.04021128922341737], ["bradley", 0.04021128922341737], ["stables", 0.04021128922341737], ["newness", 0.04021128922341737], ["terribly", 0.04021128922341737], ["receiver", 0.04021128922341737], ["manage", 0.04021128922341737], ["private", 0.04021128922341737], ["drafting", 0.04021128922341737], ["butler", 0.04021128922341737], ["labyrinth", 0.04021128922341737], ["chef", 0.04021128922341737], ["grass", 0.04021128922341737], ["beautifully", 0.04021128922341737], ["delahanty", 0.03777330555857177], ["cellar", 0.03777330555857177], ["voice", 0.03738912300516905], ["french", 0.035882258513536096], ["stone", 0.035882258513536096], ["mad", 0.035882258513536096], ["pool", 0.035882258513536096], ["time", 0.034961358022337026], ["sea", 0.03433716057460428], ["swimming", 0.03433716057460428], ["tennis", 0.03433716057460428], ["hole", 0.03433716057460428], ["property", 0.03433716057460428], ["sale", 0.03433716057460428], ["place", 0.033786386700361035], ["field", 0.033030798881152935], ["interesting", 0.03189917690975868], ["fall", 0.03189917690975868], ["instance", 0.03189917690975868], ["golf", 0.030901015590636786], ["houses", 0.030008129864723003], ["realized", 0.030008129864723003], ["longer", 0.030008129864723003], ["price", 0.029200416476550754], ["broke", 0.02846303192579118], ["loud", 0.02846303192579118], ["takes", 0.02846303192579118], ["places", 0.02846303192579118], ["english", 0.02846303192579118], ["worth", 0.027784703894659517], ["stuff", 0.027784703894659517], ["speaking", 0.027156670232339843], ["sound", 0.027156670232339843], ["bit", 0.026571984880755507], ["colonel", 0.02602504826094558], ["wonderful", 0.02551128027945037], ["minute", 0.025026886941823687], ["tired", 0.025026886941823687], ["live", 0.024568690151397624], ["leave", 0.023720525248372346], ["full", 0.021282541583526746], ["heard", 0.02098515751732954], ["war", 0.02069785623194241], ["going", 0.020488397098334304], ["course", 0.020419976377510283], ["hell", 0.020419976377510283], ["real", 0.020150919612132483], ["good", 0.0200017851342253], ["nice", 0.019890142843770164], ["pretty", 0.01892056359650115], ["find", 0.01847443026187893], ["three", 0.015875021215925742], ["lot", 0.01556111213388889], ["day", 0.014276790963319389], ["room", 0.014276790963319389], ["thought", 0.013397157118559697], ["looked", 0.012280468325075603]], "sentiment": ["Above the sound of room noises, I heard someone ask, \u201cHave a good time?\u201d\n\u201cSo-so,\u201d said a vaguely familiar, faraway voice. \u201cThink we\u2019ll try Newport next time.

It was a dangerous place to be. The whole city was dangerous\u2014because of chemicals and the uneven distribution of wealth and so on. A lot of people were like Dwayne: they created chemicals in their own bodies which were bad for their heads. But there were thousands upon thousands of other people in the city who bought bad chemicals and ate them or sniffed them\u2014or injected them into their veins with devices which looked like this:\nSometimes they even stuffed bad chemicals up their assholes. Their assholes looked like this:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nPeople took such awful chances with chemicals and their bodies because they wanted the quality of their lives to improve. They lived in ugly places where there were only ugly things to do. They didn\u2019t own doodley-squat, so they couldn\u2019t improve their surroundings. So they did their best to make their insides beautiful instead.\nThe results had been catastrophic so far\u2014suicide, theft, murder, and insanity and so on. But new chemicals were coming onto the market all the time. Twenty feet away from Trout there on Forty-second Street, a fourteen-year-old white boy lay unconscious in the doorway of a pornography store. He had swallowed a half pint of a new type of paint remover which had gone on sale for the first time only the day before. He had also swallowed two pills which were intended to prevent contagious abortion in cattle, which was called Bang\u2019s disease.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTrout was petrified there on Forty-second Street. It had given him a life not worth living, but I had also given him an iron will to live. This was a common combination on the planet Earth.\nThe theater manager came out and locked the door behind him.\nAnd two young black prostitutes materialized from nowhere.

Changing it to a gallon of sherry?\u201d\n\u201cNope. Wasn\u2019t even working on that one. I was changing something else. Changed my mind about what the first thing I want is,\u201d said Kniptash.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Coleman, fascinated.\nDonnini winced. So did Kleinhans. The notebooks had heightened the spiritual conflict between Donnini and Kniptash, had defined it in black and white. The recipes that Kniptash contributed were flamboyant, made up on the spot. Donnini\u2019s were scrupulously authentic, artistic. Coleman was caught between. It was gourmet versus glutton, artist versus materialist, beauty versus the beast. Donnini was grateful for an ally, even Corporal Kleinhans.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me yet,\u201d said Coleman, flipping pages. \u201cWait\u2019ll I get set with the first page.\u201d The most important section of each of the notebooks was, by far, the first page. By agreement, it was dedicated to the dish each man looked forward to above all others. On his first page, Donnini had lovingly inscribed the formula for Anitra al Cognac\u2014brandied duck. Kniptash had given the place of honor to his pancake horror. Coleman had plumped uncertainly for ham and candied sweet potatoes, but had been argued out of it. Terribly torn, he had written both Kniptash\u2019s and Donnini\u2019s selections on his first page, putting off a decision until a later date. Now, Kniptash was tantalizing him with a modification of his atrocity. Donnini sighed. Coleman was weak. Perhaps Kniptash\u2019s new twist would woo him away from Anitra al Cognac altogether.\n\u201cHoney\u2019s out,\u201d said Kniptash firmly. \u201cI kind of wondered about it. Now I know it\u2019s all wrong. Doesn\u2019t go with eggs, honey doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nColeman erased. \u201cWell?\u201d he said expectantly.\n\u201cHot fudge on top,\u201d said Kniptash. \u201cA big blob of hot fudge\u2014just let \u2019er set on top and spread out.\u201d\n\u201cMmmmmmmmmmm,\u201d said Coleman.", 0.12881593714927048], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
