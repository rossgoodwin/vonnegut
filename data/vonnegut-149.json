It\u2019s just fun to think about.\u201d\nAnd then, as though in trances, the people would really do it\u2014have slaves fight each other to the death in the Colosseum, or burn people alive in the public square for holding opinions which were locally unpopular, or build factories whose only purpose was to kill people in industrial quantities, or to blow up whole cities, and on and on.\nSomewhere in Mandarax there should have been, but was not, a warning to this effect: \u201cIn this era of big brains, anything which can be done will be done\u2014so hunker down.\u201d\nThe closest Mandarax came to saying anything like that was a quotation from Thomas Carlyle (1795\u20131881):\nDoubt, of whatever kind, can be ended in Action alone.\nMary\u2019s doubts about whether a woman could be impregnated by another one on a desert island without any technical assistance led to her taking action. In a trancelike state, she found herself visiting the camp of the Kanka-bono women on the other side of the crater, having brought Akiko along as an interpreter.\nAnd now I catch myself remembering my father when he was still alive, when he was still an ink-stained wretch in Cohoes.

We are as powerful as gods! There has never been anything to stop us from doing even the most frightful things, if even the most frightful things are what we choose to do.\u2019\n\u201cSo your idea is a much better one, Rabo.

I thought you would be jaded by now. How many books have been dedicated to you so far? Twenty, I\u2019ll bet. [\u2026]\nI have turned my old barn into a studio, as I may have told you. Your father\u2019s splendid bat is up on the wall. My son Mark, incidentally, is having a one-man show of oils in a place called Newfoundland in the Poconos. I am amazed. Last Christmas Jane and I gave Mark and Edith huge canvases\u2014nine feet long and six feet high. Mark filled his up in two hours flat. Edith is into her third month with hers. The trouble with Edie is that she can draw like Albrecht D\u00fcrer. She wastes hour after hour getting everything exactly right. Too bad.\nI guess I told you that I finally finished my war book. And that turned me off. I sure don\u2019t want to write any more. I try to think up new things to do\u2014like Vista, maybe. Really. I sit around here with my thumb up my ass while my wife works her guts out at McCarthy headquarters.\nLove to Kitty. Come up in the fall, and we can watch the ducks and geese come through. There\u2019ll be no need to shoot. I\u2019ve got a little house up in the marsh, by the way, and a little blue rowboat named \u201cBob\u201d comes with it. I am the only guy who ever goes out on the marsh. Really: I never see another soul. Maybe I should learn the names of the plants and birds.\nAbout smoking: it takes two weeks to quit.
