If they had to have a football rally, he wished they\u2019d hold it somewhere where it wouldn\u2019t bother him and his team. That was another thing: Cornell was so cheap, they quartered their athletes on the campus rather than setting up a separate establishment away from all the student racket. \u201cWait\u2019ll they shut up, Bucky boy, and I can hear myself think.\u201d\n\u201cCheer, cheer, here we are again,\nTo cheer for the Red and White!\u201d\nEither Cornell was going to get progressive, or they could find themselves another coach, Roseberry told himself. Now, Tennessee\u2014there was a progressive setup. They kept their team in Miami Beach, and no wonder Milankowitz went there for $35,000, after he turned down Chicago for $40,000. \u201cO.K., Bucky, I can hear again. What about I meet you down at The Dutch for a couple of quick ones in fifteen minutes?\u201d\nThe voice was faint, reluctant. \u201cJust for half an hour.\u201d\nDoctor Roseberry climbed into his black convertible in the team parking lot, and drove over to the Delta Upsilon fraternity house, on whose lawn he\u2019d first spotted Buck Young playing interfraternity football. There, Young had done things for Delta Upsilon for nothing that any college in the country would have considered a steal at $50,000 a year.\nThat had been last fall, and D.U. had eked out the interfraternity football championship with 450 points to their opponents\u2019 six. Young had scored 390 of the points, and had thrown the passes for the other 54, the remaining touchdown being accounted for by a George Ward, whose name had somehow burned itself into Roseberry\u2019s memory along with all of the other statistics.\nBut Young had said firmly, when Roseberry had approached him, that he played football for fun, and that he wanted to be an engineer. A year ago, with the Big Red by far the biggest thing in the East, with the Yale and Penn alumni still to mobilize their economic resources, Roseberry could afford to be amused by Young\u2019s preference for a career in engineering. Now nothing was amusing, and Roseberry saw Young as his one chance to remain a PE-002 under the fouled-up Cornell football economics. He would sell a couple of supernatural linemen to Harvard, who would buy anything that was cheap, and use the proceeds to buy himself the services of Young at far below their value on the open market.", 0.055185185185185184], "title": "Player Piano"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["rust", 0.2140642532436175], ["slipped", 0.15182611335251014], ["needy", 0.15182611335251014], ["incomparable", 0.15182611335251014], ["mollifier", 0.15182611335251014], ["positively", 0.1344974338385115], ["mollified", 0.1344974338385115], ["hokay", 0.1344974338385115], ["news", 0.11331910221650426], ["hills", 0.11159016554165763], ["fraternally", 0.11159016554165763], ["utterly", 0.10703212662180875], ["issue", 0.1031783596261273], ["eat", 0.1031783596261273], ["forward", 0.09984007481051423], ["included", 0.09689549891910465], ["1983", 0.09426148602765899], ["hoping", 0.09187873153255087], ["24", 0.08584968011212867], ["include", 0.08412485832495487], ["honored", 0.08099577975110472], ["paid", 0.08099577975110472], ["heart", 0.07343875795428138], ["honor", 0.07343875795428138], ["late", 0.07237476759381149], ["august", 0.07237476759381149], ["word", 0.06943019170240189], ["case", 0.060237072199268965], ["best", 0.04988767725486714], ["hope", 0.04905426674817734], ["money", 0.04422448602240588], ["vonnegut", 0.025618145154243863], ["city", 0.014396907720180072], ["york", 0.01388979094089243], ["kurt", 0.012499931930869311], ["dear", 0.008011797381869296]], "sentiment": ["Kurt Vonnegut\nAugust 24, 1983\n[New York City]\nTO RUST HILLS\nDear Rust\u2014\nWhat an incomparable mollifier you are.\nWord of honor: I am utterly mollified.

I speak these words in Russian, from my heart, and my surviving son, Alexei, writes them down in English. He studies English in school and German also. He likes English best. He admires your Jack London and your O. Henry and your Mark Twain. Alexei is seventeen. He is going to be a scientist like his brother Stepan.\nHe wants me to tell you that he is going to work on science for peace, not war. He wants me to tell you also that he does not hate the memory of your son. He understands that your son was ordered to do what he did. He is talking very much, and would like to compose this letter himself. He thinks that a man forty-nine is a very old man, and he does not think that a very old man who can do nothing but put one stone on top of another can say the right things about young men who die in space.\nIf he wishes, he can write a letter of his own about the deaths of Stepan and your son. This is my letter, and I will get Aksinia, Stepan\u2019s widow, to read it to me to make sure Alexei has made it say exactly what I wish it to say. Aksinia, too, understands English very well. She is a physician for children. She is beautiful. She works very hard so she can forget sometimes her grief for Stepan.\nI will tell you a joke, Mr. Ashland. When the second baby moon of the U.S.S.R. went up with a dog in it, we whispered that it was not really a dog inside, but Prokhor Ivanoff, a dairy manager who had been arrested for theft two days before. It was only a joke, but it made me think what a terrible punishment it would be to send a human being up there. I could not stop thinking about that. I dreamed about it at night, and I dreamed that it was myself who was being punished.\nI would have asked my elder son Stepan about life in space, but he was far away in Guryev, on the Caspian Sea. So I asked my younger son. Alexei laughed at my fears of space. He said that a man could be made very comfortable up there. He said that many young men would be going up there soon. First they would ride in baby moons. Then they would go to the moon itself Then they would go to other planets. He laughed at me, because only an old man would worry about such simple trips.\nAlexei told me that the only inconvenience would be the lack of gravity. That seemed like a great lack to me. Alexei said one would have to drink out of nursing bottles, and one would have to get used to the feeling of falling constantly, and one would have to learn to control one\u2019s movements because gravity would no longer offer resistance to them. That was all. Alexei did not think such things would be bothersome. He expected to go to Mars soon.\nOlga, my wife, laughed at me, too, because I was too old to understand the great new Age of Space. \"Two Russian moons shine overhead,\" she said, \"and my husband is the only man on earth who does not yet believe it!\"\nBut I went on dreaming bad dreams about space, and now I had information to make my bad dreams truly scientific. I dreamed of nursing bottles and falling, falling, falling, and the strange movements of my limbs. Perhaps the dreams were supernatural. Perhaps something was trying to warn me that Stepan would soon be suffering in space as I had suffered in dreams. Perhaps something was trying to warn me that Stepan would be murdered in space.\nAlexei is very embarrassed that I should say that in a letter to the United States of America. He says that you will think that I am a superstitious peasant. So be it. I think that scientific persons of the future will scoff at scientific persons of the present. They will scoff because scientific persons of the present thought so many important things were superstitions. The things I dreamed about space all came true for my son. Stepan suffered very much up there. After the fourth day in space, Stepan sometimes cried like a baby. I had cried like a baby in my dreams.\nI am not a coward, and I do not love comfort more than the improvement of human life. I am not a coward for my sons, either. I knew great suffering in the war, and I understand that there must be great suffering before great joy. But when I thought of the suffering that must surely come to a man in space, I could not see the joy to be earned by it. This was long before Stepan went up in his baby moon.", 0.17635093982496583], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
