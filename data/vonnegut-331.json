somewhere on the other side of the door, would let him out only when it was good and ready to.\n30\nHISTORY, PERSONIFIED AT this point in the life of Doctor Paul Proteus by Ed Finnerty and the Reverend James J. Lasher, let Paul out of his cell in an old Ilium air-raid shelter only in order for him to eliminate the wastes accrued in the process of his continued existence as an animal. Other signs of his being alive\u2014outcries, protests, demands, profanity\u2014were beneath History\u2019s notice until the proper time came, when the door swung open, and Ed Finnerty ushered Paul into his first meeting of the Ghost Shirt Society.\nWhen Paul was led into the meeting chamber, another segment of the air-raid shelter system, everyone stood: Lasher, at the head of the table, Bud Calhoun, Katharine Finch, Luke Lubbock, Paul\u2019s tenant farmer Mr. Haycox, and a score of others, whose names Paul didn\u2019t know.\nIt wasn\u2019t a brilliant-looking aggregation of conspirators, on the whole, but a righteous and determined one. Paul supposed that Lasher and Finnerty had gathered the group on the basis of availability and trustworthiness rather than talent, starting, seemingly, with some of the more intelligent regulars at the saloon at the foot of the bridge. While the group was predominantly composed of Iliumites, Paul learned, every region of the country was represented.\nAmid the mediocrity was a scattering of men who radiated a good deal of competence and, incidentally, prosperity, who seemed, like Paul, in the act of deserting a system that had treated them very well indeed.\nAs Paul studied these interesting exceptions, he looked at one of the seedier members adjacent, and was surprised by another familiar face\u2014that of Professor Ludwig von Neumann, a slight, disorderly old man, who had taught political science at Union College in Schenectady until the Social Sciences Building had been torn down to make space for the new Heat and Power Laboratory.

The expressions of the applauders were somewhat chilly, giving Paul to understand that he could never really be a full partner in their enterprise, since he had not been with them from the beginning.\nThe only exceptions to this snobbery were Katharine Finch, formerly Paul\u2019s secretary, and Bud Calhoun, both of whom seemed as amiable and unchanged as though they were lounging in Paul\u2019s outer office at the Works in the old days. Bud, Paul reflected, moved from situation to situation in the protective atmosphere of his imagination, while Katharine was similarly insulated by her adoration for Bud.", 0.07944324194324194], "title": "Player Piano"}, "letters": {"tfidf": [["laurel", 0.10214994975076823], ["hardy", 0.10214994975076823], ["jonah", 0.07687398144430893], ["sahl", 0.07687398144430893], ["onstage", 0.06809996650051214], ["shawn", 0.06809996650051214], ["comedian", 0.06809996650051214], ["window", 0.05932595155671537], ["documentary", 0.05650134964134563], ["rest", 0.05010868347370744], ["dick", 0.04906101211093906], ["stand", 0.044406268058719854], ["weide", 0.03960260196118942], ["planetary", 0.038436990722154465], ["televise", 0.038436990722154465], ["nightclubs", 0.038436990722154465], ["videotape", 0.038436990722154465], ["dazed", 0.038436990722154465], ["keaton", 0.038436990722154465], ["jackie", 0.038436990722154465], ["assassin", 0.038436990722154465], ["mort", 0.038436990722154465], ["spit", 0.038436990722154465], ["excuse", 0.038436990722154465], ["attacks", 0.038436990722154465], ["wintry", 0.038436990722154465], ["nutcracker", 0.038436990722154465], ["catskills", 0.038436990722154465], ["mock", 0.038436990722154465], ["critiques", 0.038436990722154465], ["whale", 0.038436990722154465], ["benny", 0.038436990722154465], ["christmastime", 0.038436990722154465], ["mind", 0.037184181242674114], ["love", 0.03447588330354648], ["pals", 0.03404998325025607], ["buster", 0.03404998325025607], ["visible", 0.03404998325025607], ["raiser", 0.03404998325025607], ["privilege", 0.03404998325025607], ["lenny", 0.03404998325025607], ["beach", 0.03404998325025607], ["flattered", 0.03404998325025607], ["perfection", 0.03404998325025607], ["controversial", 0.031483748388811995], ["oswald", 0.031483748388811995], ["touched", 0.031483748388811995], ["mason", 0.031483748388811995], ["bruce", 0.031483748388811995], ["silence", 0.031483748388811995], ["genuinely", 0.031483748388811995], ["rank", 0.031483748388811995], ["wanted", 0.031166159765268105], ["warren", 0.029662975778357685], ["angeles", 0.029662975778357685], ["los", 0.029662975778357685], ["comedians", 0.029662975778357685], ["performance", 0.029662975778357685], ["humanity", 0.028250674820672814], ["pen", 0.028250674820672814], ["commission", 0.028250674820672814], ["appearance", 0.028250674820672814], ["fund", 0.028250674820672814], ["performances", 0.028250674820672814], ["heller", 0.027096740916913605], ["kennedy", 0.027096740916913605], ["youth", 0.027096740916913605], ["harvey", 0.027096740916913605], ["lee", 0.027096740916913605], ["planet", 0.027096740916913605], ["finding", 0.027096740916913605], ["watching", 0.026121103702817037], ["drop", 0.026121103702817037], ["begun", 0.026121103702817037], ["caught", 0.026121103702817037], ["performed", 0.026121103702817037], ["couple", 0.025475968652582094], ["jack", 0.025275968306459298], ["jews", 0.025275968306459298], ["opening", 0.025275968306459298], ["27", 0.02453050605546953], ["opened", 0.02453050605546953], ["childhood", 0.02453050605546953], ["talked", 0.02453050605546953], ["hang", 0.02453050605546953], ["report", 0.023863667348774424], ["listen", 0.023863667348774424], ["find", 0.023840377114860496], ["movies", 0.023260438362671103], ["appeared", 0.023260438362671103], ["1987", 0.023260438362671103], ["political", 0.023260438362671103], ["supper", 0.023260438362671103], ["continued", 0.02270973344501522], ["moment", 0.02270973344501522], ["sick", 0.021734096230918647], ["perfect", 0.021297432487330344], ["thirty", 0.021297432487330344], ["worth", 0.02014349858357114], ["audience", 0.01980130098059471], ["popular", 0.01832272597311683], ["couldn", 0.018064358919191167], ["work", 0.017724249362512642], ["students", 0.01757726372212706], ["bob", 0.017124991798189437], ["works", 0.016702894491235812], ["interest", 0.016702894491235812], ["months", 0.01650195336266252], ["dead", 0.016307196029328636], ["mine", 0.01611825322458382], ["knew", 0.015934787801335386], ["john", 0.015756491111672752], ["december", 0.015583079882634052], ["years", 0.014876009293031563], ["written", 0.014486423418874328], ["robert", 0.014486423418874328], ["hear", 0.01406896792652118], ["making", 0.013805216683479608], ["night", 0.012848058647252246], ["thought", 0.012315887019337425], ["god", 0.011638848287994592], ["ago", 0.010546362574912352], ["thing", 0.009887247010022499], ["man", 0.009887247010022499], ["writing", 0.009614985079113063], ["going", 0.008862124681256321], ["city", 0.00364478676460255], ["york", 0.0035164027698461847], ["vonnegut", 0.003242803184081501], ["kurt", 0.0031645397293340025], ["dear", 0.0020283031346504544]], "sentiment": ["Kurt Vonnegut\nDecember 27, 1987\nNew York City\nTO ROBERT WEIDE\nWeide had written Kurt that he had begun work on a documentary of Laurel and Hardy.\nDick Shawn was a stand-up comedian who performed in nightclubs around the world and appeared in more than thirty movies. Mort Sahl was a popular stand-up comedian whose attacks on the Warren Commission Report\u2019s finding that Lee Harvey Oswald alone was John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassin were among the political critiques that made him controversial.\nDear Bob\u2014\nHow can I not be touched and flattered by your continued interest in my work? I now have a videotape, by the way, of the only visible thing I\u2019ve done worth watching, an onstage performance at a fund-raiser for PEN a couple of years ago. The rest is silence.\nAs for Laurel and Hardy: to find yet another excuse to televise their perfect works has to be O.K., like doing the Nutcracker yet again at Christmastime. Nobody gets sick of perfection, if he or she can get a few months of rest between performances. Two other comedians who are in the first rank with Laurel and Hardy: Jack Benny and Buster Keaton. All humanity is the audience they were able to keep in mind. Almost nobody can do that, so I tell writing students of mine not to try. I mock the wish to do it as being like opening a window on a wintry night and trying to make love to everybody on the planet. I tell them to make love to those they know.\nLenny Bruce made love to a few pals from childhood and youth, and the rest of us could listen, if we wanted. Heller still does that. I saw Sahl in his recent appearance here, and he had opened a window and was trying to make love to the world. He couldn\u2019t begin to do it right. Jackie Mason is now onstage making love in his mind to Jews in the Catskills, and I find it a privilege to hear what he says to them. I am sorry you didn\u2019t make a documentary on Dick Shawn, but nobody knew he was going to drop dead just at the moment he had got the hang, somehow, of being genuinely planetary. I caught his one-man show in Los Angeles a couple of years back, and talked to him afterwards at supper.
