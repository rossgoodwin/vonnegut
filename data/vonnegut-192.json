The news, after all, could hardly have been worse. Foreigners and criminals and other endlessly greedy conglomerates were gobbling up RAMJAC. Mary Kathleen\u2019s legacy to the people was being converted to mountains of rapidly deteriorating currency, which were being squandered in turn on a huge new bureaucracy and on legal fees and consultants\u2019 fees, and on and on. What was left, it was said by the politicians, would help to pay the interest on the people\u2019s national debt, and would buy them more of the highways and public buildings and advanced weaponry they so richly deserved.\nAlso: I was about to go to jail again.\nSo I elected to complain about our levity. \u201cYou know what is finally going to kill this planet?\u201d I said.\n\u201cCholesterol!\u201d said Frank Ubriaco.\n\u201cA total lack of seriousness,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody gives a damn anymore about what\u2019s really going on, what\u2019s going to happen next, or how we ever got into such a mess in the first place.\u201d\nIsrael Edel, with his doctor\u2019s degree in history, took this to be a suggestion that we become even sillier, if possible. So he began to make booping and beeping sounds. Others chimed in with their own beeps and boops. They were all imitating supposedly intelligent signals from outer space, which had been received by radio telescopes only the week before. They were the latest news sensation, and had in fact driven the RAMJAC story off the front pages. People were beeping and booping and laughing, not just at my party, but everywhere.\nNobody was prepared to guess what the signals meant. Scientists did say, though, that if the signals were coming from whence they appeared to come, they had to be a million years old or more.

I trundled it off to my bedroom, to my slab of rubber on living rock.\nThere was no index, so my search for the implications of zah-mah-ki-bo was difficult; was, in fact, fruitless that night.\nI learned some things, but they were scarcely helpful. I learned of the Bokononist cosmogony, for instance, wherein Borasisi, the sun, held Pabu, the moon, in his arms, and hoped that Pabu would bear him a fiery child.\nBut poor Pabu gave birth to children that were cold, that did not burn; and Borasisi threw them away in disgust. These were the planets, who circled their terrible father at a safe distance.\nThen poor Pabu herself was cast away, and she went to live with her favorite child, which was Earth.

You could use this battalion or that one, depending on what color people they were supposed to fight.\nThe Soviet Union, of course, with citizenry, including every sort of a human being but a Black or Hispanic, found out the hard way that soldiers wouldn\u2019t fight hard at all against people who looked and thought and talked like them.\nTHE RAINBOW DIVISION itself began during World War I, as an experiment integrating unlike Americans who weren\u2019t Army Regulars. Reserve Divisions activated back then were all identified with specific parts of the country. Then somebody got the idea of putting together a Division composed of draftees and volunteers from all different parts of the country, to prove how well they could get along.\nHarmony between White people thought not to like each other very much was what the rainbow represented then. The Rainbow Division did in fact fight about as well as any other one during the War to End Wars, the prelude to the Finale Rack.\nAFTERWARD, THE EXPERIMENT complete, the 42nd Division became merely one more National Guard outfit, arbitrarily handed over with its battle ribbons to New York State.\nBut the symbol of the rainbow lives on in its shoulder patch.\nBefore I was arrested for insurrection, I myself was a wearer of that rainbow, along with the star of a Brigadier!\n39\nDURING MY FIRST 2 weeks as Military Commander of the Scipio District, all the way to the head of the lake and all the way down to the National Forest, the best thing I did, I think, was to make some of the soldiers firemen. A few had been firemen in civilian life, so I got them to familiarize themselves with the town\u2019s firefighting apparatus, which hadn\u2019t been hurt during the siege. One real stroke of luck: the fire trucks all had full tanks of gasoline. You would have thought, in a society where everybody from top to bottom was stealing everything that wasn\u2019t nailed down, that somebody would have siphoned off that priceless gasoline.\nEvery so often, in the midst of chaos, you come across an amazing, inexplicable instance of civic responsibility.
