"sentiment": ["TO DON FARBER\nPaddy Chayefsky was a playwright, screenwriter, and novelist. His original drama Marty was considered one of the high points of the Golden Age of Television, and as a movie his screenplay won an Academy Award, followed by Academy Awards for his screenplays of the movies Hospital and Network.\nDear Don\u2014\n[\u2026] That is good news that you are about to be affiliated with a big and stable firm. I have been worried about your present set-up, with only you knowing what was going on, and with so many sudden changes in your supporting staff. I could not help feeling that things were falling apart from time to time, causing you to be hideously overworked. That\u2019s all going to change. That\u2019s great. There are so many little favors and bits of information I need, and there will be others I can bother under the new set-up.\nAnd now is surely an opportune time to restructure our relationship, if either of us feels it should be restructured. So much of what you do for me now fell into your lap accidentally, as a result of Max\u2019s petering out, as a result of my giving your address as my own in Who\u2019s Who, and so on.\nFrom now on, you should reply only to letters containing business propositions. The pests wanting me to speak or to send my autograph or to hear their philosophies of life or whatever should be routinely forwarded to me by some clerk, without your having to note their contents at all. If a business proposition slips by, I will catch it here.\nAs for the handling of my book business and personal finances and family matters: Nothing could be more solid and satisfactory from my point of view. If this is somehow burdensome to you, please say so. As for the aggressive merchandising, actual boorish, frenzied Polo Lounge hustling of the movie and TV rights of my work: That is quite possibly something I should not ask you to do, and something you should not ask yourself to do. The madmen who put the big actors and directors and producers together for monster money deals are specialists, after all, behaving in ways that you don\u2019t have the time or foolishness to behave. You have enough to do already as an unassisted practitioner of law.\nI talked about TV and movie sales some to Paddy Chayefsky at lunch yesterday. He is crazy about Jailbird, as you know. He gave me an outline of the book, scene by scene. He said I would have to do the script, that nobody else could maintain the tone. He also said that you and I should simply sit pat for a few weeks, while the book climbs to the top of the list, knocking off, we hope, Sophie\u2019s Choice, which sold to the movies for close to a million. If the rise of the book itself does not generate any big offers, he said, then we should turn over the merchandising to Arlene Donovan (my editor on Sirens) and Sam Cohn at full commission. Would that be acceptable to you? We would arrange some special compensation scheme for you in such a case, and you, as always, would have the final say as to the terms of the contract, if any.\nMuch love as always\u2014\nKurt Vonnegut", 0.16597314847314842], "title": "Letters"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["arch", 0.09256053963879937], ["painted", 0.08384085989453775], ["paint", 0.08052579151115585], ["waterfall", 0.07285536260924763], ["white", 0.07278620160770691], ["palace", 0.07080568132313313], ["humid", 0.061186660799183445], ["nage", 0.061186660799183445], ["barn", 0.061186660799183445], ["inquire", 0.061186660799183445], ["relief", 0.061186660799183445], ["shallower", 0.061186660799183445], ["dome", 0.061186660799183445], ["abated", 0.061186660799183445], ["translucent", 0.061186660799183445], ["idiotic", 0.061186660799183445], ["miraculous", 0.061186660799183445], ["fleshy", 0.061186660799183445], ["igloo", 0.061186660799183445], ["left", 0.054943338460105615], ["waiting", 0.05373346530929156], ["unpleasant", 0.05373346530929156], ["doors", 0.05373346530929156], ["122", 0.05373346530929156], ["roof", 0.05373346530929156], ["yard", 0.05373346530929156], ["ends", 0.04937362543716077], ["blank", 0.04937362543716077], ["winds", 0.04937362543716077], ["robinson", 0.04937362543716077], ["dungeon", 0.04937362543716077], ["granfalloon", 0.04937362543716077], ["taxicab", 0.04937362543716077], ["consisted", 0.04937362543716077], ["swiss", 0.04937362543716077], ["deep", 0.046280269819399686], ["letters", 0.046280269819399686], ["leaned", 0.046280269819399686], ["underground", 0.046280269819399686], ["survived", 0.046280269819399686], ["remained", 0.043880876794515696], ["fool", 0.04192042994726888], ["stars", 0.04192042994726888], ["ready", 0.04026289575557793], ["stayed", 0.04026289575557793], ["cave", 0.03882707432950779], ["moved", 0.03882707432950779], ["poem", 0.03882707432950779], ["gate", 0.03756059007513808], ["cab", 0.03756059007513808], ["conners", 0.03756059007513808], ["crosbys", 0.03756059007513808], ["mona", 0.03699069980154707], ["oubliette", 0.03540284066156656], ["closed", 0.03540284066156656], ["speak", 0.03540284066156656], ["moment", 0.034467234457377], ["hoenikker", 0.03327365006306512], ["met", 0.03280970026568604], ["front", 0.03280970026568604], ["family", 0.03206784143249301], ["mind", 0.03010739458524619], ["days", 0.03010739458524619], ["happened", 0.03010739458524619], ["sort", 0.029526026614598064], ["franklin", 0.029526026614598064], ["blue", 0.02897448581473193], ["wrote", 0.02897448581473193], ["julian", 0.028449860393555244], ["philip", 0.027949645171674673], ["head", 0.025356504775794157], ["frank", 0.025130556500538068], ["house", 0.024614645942601134], ["ice", 0.023589805299543878], ["eyes", 0.02326880569578386], ["crosby", 0.02295711175091018], ["three", 0.02295711175091018], ["wasn", 0.021255778361502716], ["angela", 0.018908965823653066], ["castle", 0.016467487859832135], ["newt", 0.01613660980965199], ["asked", 0.012682795137711938]], "sentiment": ["I let my mind go blank.

What remained was the cave under the waterfall, which had become a sort of igloo under a translucent, blue-white dome of ice-nine.\nThe m\u00e9nage consisted of Frank, little Newt, and the Crosbys. They had survived in a dungeon in the palace, one far shallower and more unpleasant than the oubliette.

I\u2019m human and I couldn\u2019t help being hurt when they scrapped it after I\u2019d left it, instead of putting it in storage. It was a good, homey, comfortable body; nothing fast and flashy, but reliable. But there isn\u2019t much call for that kind of body at the centers, I guess. I never ask for one, at any rate.\nThe worst experience I ever had with a body was when I was flimflammed into taking out the one that had belonged to Dr. Ellis Konigswasser. It belongs to the Amphibious Pioneers\u2019 Society and only gets taken out once a year for the big Pioneers\u2019 Day Parade, on the anniversary of Konigswasser\u2019s discovery. Everybody said it was a great honor for me to be picked to get into Konigswasser\u2019s body and lead the parade.\nLike a plain damn fool, I believed them.\nThey\u2019ll have a tough time getting me into that thing again\u2014ever. Taking that wreck out certainly made it plain why Konigswasser discovered how people could do without their bodies. That old one of his practically drives you out. Ulcers, headaches, arthritis, fallen arches\u2014a nose like a pruning hook, piggy little eyes, and a complexion like a used steamer trunk. He was and still is the sweetest person you\u2019d ever want to know, but, back when he was stuck with that body, nobody got close enough to find out.\nWe tried to get Konigswasser back into his old body to lead us when we first started having the Pioneers\u2019 Day Parades, but he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with it, so we always have to flatter some poor boob into taking on the job. Konigswasser marches, all right, but as a six-foot cowboy who can bend beer cans double between his thumb and middle finger.\nKonigswasser is just like a kid with that body. He never gets tired of bending beer cans with it, and we all have to stand around in our bodies after the parade, and watch as though we were very impressed.\nI don\u2019t suppose he could bend very much of anything back in the old days.\nNobody mentions it to him, since he\u2019s the grand old man of the Amphibious Age, but he plays hell with bodies. Almost every time he takes one out, he busts it, showing off. Then somebody has to get into a surgeon\u2019s body and sew it up again.\nI don\u2019t mean to be disrespectful of Konigswasser. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s a respectful thing to say that somebody is childish in certain ways, because it\u2019s people like that who seem to get all the big ideas.\nThere is a picture of him in the old days down at the Historical Society, and you can see from that that he never did grow up as far as keeping up his appearance went\u2014doing what little he could with the rattle-trap body Nature had issued him.", 0.04617175801138066], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["quarter", 0.6330103873894893], ["spew", 0.31650519369474467], ["heroic", 0.31650519369474467], ["balderdash", 0.31650519369474467], ["event", 0.31650519369474467], ["mercy", 0.27799701699696994], ["inwardly", 0.27799701699696994], ["sword", 0.27799701699696994], ["beg", 0.2394888402991952], ["asked", 0.22709197633729467], ["laugh", 0.20839907430278282], ["hope", 0.18328878965039078], ["will", 0.13767875897984463], ["woodly", 0.11804049980841874], ["harold", 0.025917964608866036]], "sentiment": ["HAROLD\nYou hope.\nWOODLY\nIn any event, I will not beg for mercy.\nHAROLD\nNo quarter asked.\n(taking a sword)\nNo quarter given.\nWOODLY\nDon't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?", 0.5], "title": "Happy Birthday, Wanda June"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["personal", 0.3921082207551585], ["question", 0.31011165362091303], ["lover", 0.30612465344279033], ["answer", 0.2166863075640877], ["figuring", 0.18850143280746323], ["earnings", 0.18850143280746323], ["ability", 0.18850143280746323], ["basically", 0.18850143280746323], ["schoolteacher", 0.16614184633778756], ["janitor", 0.16614184633778756], ["honest", 0.13658408079346], ["kill", 0.13070274025171952], ["great", 0.12724796168538507], ["andy", 0.12573013767664667], ["report", 0.12573013767664667], ["silly", 0.11114997239461255], ["chance", 0.10576113095386526], ["guess", 0.06570586862132387], ["school", 0.06230714230978108], ["kind", 0.06230714230978108], ["head", 0.060427500112233475], ["young", 0.05982452807958339], ["money", 0.05923262038060932], ["good", 0.03806791364255782]], "sentiment": ["\u201cMay I ask you a very personal question?\u201d she said.\n\u201cAbout my ability as a great lover?\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that would be a very silly kind of question.
