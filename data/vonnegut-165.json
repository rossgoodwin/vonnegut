He was ravenous for my approval of everything he did.\nHe told me, and not Leland Clewes or Israel Edel, that he had just made Frank Ubriaco a vice-president of the McDonald\u2019s Hamburgers Division of RAMJAC.\nI nodded that I thought that was nice.\nThe nod was not enough for Leen. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful example of putting the right man in the right job,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you?

Clewes was made a vice-president of the Diamond Match Division, presumably because he had been selling advertising matchbooks for so long. Edel was made a vice-president of the Hilton Department of the Hospitality Associates, Ltd., Division, presumably because of his three weeks of experience as a night clerk at the Arapahoe.\nIt was then my turn to go into the library with him. \u201cLast but not least,\u201d he said coyly. After he closed the door on the rest of the house, his flirtatiousness became even more outrageous. \u201cCome into my parlor,\u201d he murmured, \u201csaid the spider to the fly.\u201d He winked at me broadly.\nI hated this. I wondered what had happened to the others in here.\nThere was a Mussolini-style desk with a swivel chair behind it. \u201cPerhaps you should sit there,\u201d he said. He made his eyebrows go up and down. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that look like your kind of chair? Eh? Eh? Your kind of chair?\u201d\nThis could only be mockery, I thought, I responded to it humbly.

Next in popularity is that delightful forgery, The Beatrice Rumfoord Galactic Cookbook. The third most popular is The Winston Niles Rumfoord Pocket History of Mars. The fourth most popular is a children\u2019s book, Unk and Boaz in the Caves of Mercury, by Sarah Home Canby.\nThe publisher\u2019s bland analysis of Mrs. Canby\u2019s book\u2019s success appears on the dust jacket: \"What child wouldn\u2019t like to be shipwrecked on a space ship with a cargo of hamburgers, hot dogs, catsup, sporting goods, and soda pop?\"\nDr. Frank Minot, in his Are Adults Harmoniums?, sees something more sinister in the love children have for the book. \"Dare we consider,\" he asks, \"how close Unk and Boaz are to the everyday experience of children when Unk and Boaz deal solemnly and respectfully with creatures that are in fact obscenely unmotivated, insensitive, and dull?\" Minot, in drawing a parallel between human parents and harmoniums, refers to the dealings of Unk and Boaz with harmoniums. The harmoniums spelled out for Unk and Boaz a new message of hope or veiled derision every fourteen Earthling days\u2014for three years.\nThe messages were written, of course, by Winston Niles Rumfoord, who materialized briefly on Mercury at fourteen-day intervals. He peeled off harmoniums here, slapped others up there, making the block letters.\nIn Mrs. Canby\u2019s tale, the first intimation given that Rumfoord is around the caves from time to time is given in a scene very close to the end\u2014a scene wherein Unk finds the tracks of a big dog in the dust.\nAt this point in the story it is mandatory, if an adult is reading the story aloud to a child, for the adult to ask the child with delicious hoarseness, \"Who wuzza dog?\"", 0.22682863113897597], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["cradle", 0.38284467227042907], ["cat", 0.33927566652142777], ["kids", 0.18133023186493047], ["string", 0.17416043280319754], ["damn", 0.16247138962734145], ["aha", 0.13233394079823396], ["oldest", 0.13233394079823396], ["waving", 0.13233394079823396], ["tangles", 0.13233394079823396], ["eskimos", 0.13233394079823396], ["strung", 0.13233394079823396], ["faces", 0.13233394079823396], ["bunch", 0.13233394079823396], ["hands", 0.11685142437098209], ["grownups", 0.11621423892474685], ["curled", 0.11621423892474685], ["75", 0.11621423892474685], ["scratches", 0.11621423892474685], ["grow", 0.11621423892474685], ["painty", 0.10678481780595235], ["games", 0.10678481780595235], ["remained", 0.0949051521369758], ["um", 0.09066511593246523], ["crazy", 0.08123569481367073], ["wonder", 0.07878545026348871], ["held", 0.07454541405897815], ["chair", 0.07096051452811167], ["years", 0.058425712185491044], ["children", 0.054840812654624566], ["newt", 0.03490010958831709], ["good", 0.03287658919320942]], "sentiment": ["\u201cIt\u2019s a cat\u2019s cradle.\u201d\n\u201cAha,\u201d I said. \u201cVery good.

I am prepared to swear under oath that the Law of Natural Selection did the repair job without outside assistance of any kind.\nIt was the best fisherfolk who survived in the greatest numbers in the watery environment of the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago. Those with hands and feet most like flippers were the best swimmers. Prognathous jaws were better at catching and holding fish than hands could ever be. And any fisherperson, spending more and more time underwater, could surely catch more fish if he or she were more streamlined, more bulletlike\u2014had a smaller skull.\nSo my story is told, except for the tacking on of a few not very important details I failed to cover elsewhere. I tack them on in no particular order, since I now must write in haste. Father and the blue tunnel will be coming for me at any time.\nDo people still know that they are going to die sooner or later? No. Fortunately, in my humble opinion, they have forgotten that.\nDid I myself reproduce when I was still alive? I got a high school girl pregnant by accident in Santa Fe shortly before I joined the United States Marines. Her father was the principal of her high school, and she and I didn\u2019t even like each other very much. We were just fooling around, as young people were bound to do. She had an abortion, for which her father paid. We never even found out if it would have been a daughter or a son.\nThat certainly taught me a lesson. After that, I always made sure that I or my partner was employing a birth-control device. I never married.\nAnd I have to laugh now, thinking of what a loss of dignity and beauty it would be if a modern person were, before making love, to equip himself or herself with a typical birth-control device of a million years ago.

But I certainly wasn\u2019t going to drive with a couple of drinks in me, and neither was she. It used to be almost fashionable to drive when drunk, but no more, no more.\nSo I hired a boyfriend of Celeste\u2019s to drive us over there in his father\u2019s car, and then pick us up again.\nIn the simplest terms: I was sorry that she was leaving, because she was exciting to have around. But she could also be too exciting, telling everybody exactly what to do. So I was also glad that she was going, since what I wanted most, with my own book so nearly finished, was peace and quiet for a change. To put it another way: we were acquaintances, despite our months together. We had not become great friends.\nThat would change, however, once I had shown her what was in the potato barn.\nYes, that\u2019s right: this determined widow from Baltimore, before she left, persuaded this old Armenian geezer to unlock the locks and turn on the floodlights in the potato barn.\nWhat did I get in exchange? I think we\u2019re really friends now.\n33\nWHEN WE GOT HOME from the American Hotel, the first thing she said was: \u201cOne thing you don\u2019t have to worry about: I\u2019m not going to badger you about the keys to the potato barn.\u201d\n\u201cThank God!\u201d I said.\nI think she was certain right then that, before the night was over, one way or another, she was damn well going to see what was in the potato barn.", 0.11600000000000002], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["lowell", 0.407741914291081], ["cahoon", 0.15223041333633588], ["spaceship", 0.1305695639438376], ["madelaine", 0.10522799468707732], ["sergeant", 0.0892646939443901], ["calmly", 0.08694563136441709], ["hugged", 0.08694563136441709], ["homicide", 0.08694563136441709], ["hurting", 0.08694563136441709], ["hummed", 0.08694563136441709], ["fault", 0.08694563136441709], ["push", 0.08694563136441709], ["explaining", 0.07611520666816794], ["speakin", 0.07611520666816794], ["harder", 0.07611520666816794], ["precin", 0.07611520666816794], ["taped", 0.07611520666816794], ["chest", 0.07611520666816794], ["twisted", 0.06977981435397787], ["seventh", 0.06977981435397787], ["police", 0.06657916258867336], ["hand", 0.06558701576634271], ["bitterly", 0.0652847819719188], ["finding", 0.0652847819719188], ["accident", 0.0652847819719188], ["trembled", 0.0652847819719188], ["power", 0.06179816398263427], ["report", 0.06179816398263427], ["takes", 0.058949389657728724], ["struck", 0.058949389657728724], ["grew", 0.058949389657728724], ["heart", 0.056540785285427816], ["gently", 0.056540785285427816], ["cried", 0.05445435727566965], ["arrived", 0.05445435727566965], ["straight", 0.05261399734353866], ["stand", 0.05096773928638512], ["number", 0.04947851772694255], ["hot", 0.04811896496147958], ["shot", 0.04571036058917867], ["death", 0.04571036058917867], ["telephone", 0.04571036058917867], ["story", 0.0436239325794205], ["call", 0.04178357264728951], ["table", 0.04093877231494145], ["god", 0.031846248167289565], ["turned", 0.028921067822162277], ["thought", 0.02645811556898129], ["told", 0.02490982021516518], ["head", 0.023501209324629284], ["people", 0.022209151264549386]], "sentiment": ["\u201cLowell, please\u2014\u201d She turned her head aside, and tried to push him away gently.\nHe hugged her harder.\n\u201cLowell\u2014no.

invented the chart then pointed out that half that number was 1944, the year the war ended, and that the first letters of the names of the war\u2019s leaders spelled the name of the Supreme Ruler of the Universe.\nTHE DUMBER ONES, like the dumber ones at Tarkington, used me as an ambulatory Guinness Book of World Records, asking me who the oldest person in the world was, the richest one, the woman who had had the most babies, and so on. By the time of the prison break, I think, 98 percent of the inmates at Athena knew that the greatest age ever attained by a human being whose birthdate was well documented was about 121 years, and that this incomparable survivor, like the Warden and the guards, had been Japanese. Actually, he had fallen 128 days short of reaching 121. His record was a natural foundation for all sorts of jokes at Athena, since so many of the inmates were serving life sentences, or even 2 or 3 life sentences either superimposed or laid end to end.\nThey knew that the richest man in the world was also Japanese and that, about a century before the college and the prison were founded across the lake from each other, a woman in Russia was giving birth to the last of her 69 children.\nTHE RUSSIAN WOMAN who had more babies than anyone gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets, and 4 sets of quadruplets. They all survived, which is more than you can say for the Donner Party.\nHIROSHI MATSUMOTO WAS the only member of the prison staff with a college education. He did not socialize with the others, and he took his off-duty meals alone and hiked alone and fished alone and sailed alone. Neither did he avail himself of the Japanese clubs in Rochester and Buffalo, or of the lavish rest-and-recuperation facilities maintained in Manhattan by the Japanese Army of Occupation in Business Suits. He had made so much money for his corporation in Louisville and then Athena, and was so brilliant in his understanding of American business psychology, that I am sure he could have asked for and gotten an executive job in the home office. He may have known more about American black people than anybody else in Japan, thanks to Athena, and more and more of the businesses his corporation was buying here were dependent on black labor or at least the goodwill of black neighborhoods. Again thanks to Athena, he probably knew more than any other Japanese about the largest industry by far in this country, which was the procurement and distribution of chemicals that, when introduced into the bloodstream in one way or another, gave anybody who could afford them undeserved feelings of purpose and accomplishment.\nOnly 1 of these chemicals was legal, of course, and was the basis of the fortune of the family that gave Tarkington its band uniforms, and the water tower atop Musket Mountain, and an endowed chair in Business Law, and I don\u2019t know what all else.\nThat mind-bender was alcohol.", 0.15934959349593494], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["dwayne", 0.21174625917522905], ["fit", 0.18483637133063988], ["cry", 0.17421048793472513], ["pills", 0.1581880004765721], ["straightens", 0.12542519426341256], ["husband", 0.12189561704576753], ["bottle", 0.10892168996436626], ["starts", 0.10892168996436626], ["male", 0.10892168996436626], ["hello", 0.10892168996436626], ["thinks", 0.09926775881893377], ["sweethearts", 0.09926775881893377], ["takes", 0.09926775881893377], ["turns", 0.09926775881893377], ["cried", 0.09241818566531994], ["female", 0.09241818566531994], ["worse", 0.09241818566531994], ["machine", 0.08710524396736256], ["pocket", 0.08710524396736256], ["felix", 0.08129650957056621], ["emma", 0.07060173966831625], ["beautiful", 0.05660681907540865], ["felt", 0.05660681907540865], ["open", 0.054098235369269936], ["couldn", 0.046086991640193434], ["high", 0.043663594156623374], ["rudy", 0.04010331477636233], ["school", 0.039450958248073896], ["heard", 0.037006811722833814], ["brother", 0.0332537416227485], ["life", 0.027940799924791124]], "sentiment": ["DWAYNE: It really is\u2014a beautiful machine like that.\n(FELIX straightens up and turns to look at him.)\nFELIX: Hello.
