Bernie\u2014\nThanks for your good letter, with so much encouraging news in it. I continue to marvel at your raising children with no help from anybody. I could never do it. And, whenever I wonder how it is going, I am utterly reassured by how Peter and Scott and Terry have turned out. They are as sweet and interesting as anyone I know. You might tell Terry, incidentally, that it was Terence, the Roman writer of comedies, who said: \u201cNothing human is alien to me.\u201d Goethe often gets credit for that one.\nWhen I give you advice on the kids, I am talking like a man with a paper asshole, since I couldn\u2019t stand a child-dominated household any more. I wanted to be more self-centered, and hang out with grownups for a change, and to work with fewer interruptions.\nI take off on a business trip to Europe next Saturday, September 24. My publisher, Sam Lawrence, and I will be looking in on all my northern European publishers, visiting each for a couple of days\u2014and winding up at the Frankfurt Book Fair on October 12, where Jill will join me. After that, Jill and I will go for a few days in Florence and Venice, neither of which have we seen before.\nMuch love to everybody\u2014\nK\nSeptember 21, 1977\nNew York City", 0.23368983957219247], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["cripples", 0.37980623243369366], ["create", 0.37980623243369366], ["instruction", 0.37980623243369366], ["corpses", 0.37980623243369366], ["learn", 0.33359642039636395], ["suicide", 0.306565413189153], ["cruel", 0.2725103716047536], ["police", 0.2725103716047536], ["stops", 0.2500788891633394], ["paul", 0.11907632556961971], ["woodly", 0.07082429988505125], ["penelope", 0.04104594143472942], ["harold", 0.031101557530639246]], "sentiment": ["WOODLY\nOf the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.\nPENELOPE\nThis is suicide.\n(to PAUL)\nGo get the police.\nHAROLD\nStop!\nPAUL stops.\nHAROLD", -1.0], "title": "Happy Birthday, Wanda June"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["spade", 0.18900540317326295], ["godlike", 0.16083149771645947], ["louis", 0.1408695272840174], ["happier", 0.13059446224852983], ["reinbeck", 0.12325276210067375], ["milly", 0.1126956218272139], ["times", 0.11203426767748643], ["turley", 0.08819689231420463], ["hot", 0.06322292007766953], ["married", 0.05634781091360695], ["bed", 0.05523543253165401], ["glass", 0.05418665429605863], ["smallest", 0.053610499238819824], ["inhuman", 0.053610499238819824], ["spiriting", 0.053610499238819824], ["grabbing", 0.053610499238819824], ["wives", 0.053610499238819824], ["swooping", 0.053610499238819824], ["marries", 0.053610499238819824], ["teasing", 0.04725135079331574], ["blooded", 0.04725135079331574], ["wretched", 0.04725135079331574], ["radiator", 0.04725135079331574], ["girl", 0.04481370707099458], ["shea", 0.04089220234781165], ["hill", 0.04089220234781165], ["charlie", 0.04089220234781165], ["town", 0.04047629829917384], ["direction", 0.038845013803644586], ["mistake", 0.038845013803644586], ["wished", 0.038845013803644586], ["edge", 0.038845013803644586], ["male", 0.038845013803644586], ["whitman", 0.03717233897067252], ["kissed", 0.03575811255023896], ["spot", 0.03575811255023896], ["kind", 0.03544075984593053], ["strong", 0.03453305390230756], ["golf", 0.033452475593533405], ["calling", 0.033452475593533405], ["empty", 0.033452475593533405], ["bedroom", 0.0324858653581405], ["bye", 0.0324858653581405], ["threw", 0.0324858653581405], ["cold", 0.03161146003883476], ["kidding", 0.03161146003883476], ["throw", 0.03161146003883476], ["natalie", 0.03161146003883476], ["straight", 0.030813190525168437], ["moonlight", 0.030813190525168437], ["dreams", 0.030078853757521312], ["hope", 0.030078853757521312], ["daughter", 0.028766001981001373], ["sitting", 0.028766001981001373], ["kitchen", 0.028173905456803476], ["foot", 0.028173905456803476], ["number", 0.028173905456803476], ["crazy", 0.027093327148029315], ["post", 0.026597297595091007], ["human", 0.026126716912636412], ["telling", 0.026126716912636412], ["stand", 0.026126716912636412], ["laughed", 0.02445404207966435], ["window", 0.02303981565923079], ["full", 0.02303981565923079], ["felt", 0.02271787694536593], ["course", 0.02210602947290104], ["hell", 0.02210602947290104], ["stood", 0.02125856782032292], ["pretty", 0.020482811966854454], ["great", 0.018094893634160267], ["face", 0.017720379922965265], ["call", 0.01736055686651314], ["wife", 0.01718580278421319], ["young", 0.017014315325386106], ["asked", 0.016680667213726703], ["life", 0.014765485435175233], ["big", 0.014503344403578389], ["good", 0.010826654338709107]], "sentiment": ["\u201cWhat\u2019s what like?\u201d said Louis.\n\u201cBeing a young male Reinbeck\u2014all hot-blooded and full of dreams, swooping down off the hill, grabbing a pretty little town girl and spiriting her into the moonlight.\u201d She laughed, teasing. \u201cIt must be kind of godlike.\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said Louis.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t godlike?\u201d\n\u201cGodlike?
