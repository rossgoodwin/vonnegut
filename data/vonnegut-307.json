Men and women in white, doctors and nurses, turned the soil, planted seedlings, sprayed bugs, spread fertilizer. Men and women in purple uniforms pulled up weeds, cut down plants that were old and sickly, raked leaves, carried refuse to trash burners.\nNever, never, never\u2014not even in medieval Holland or old Japan\u2014had a garden been more formal, been better tended.

No more words came. The subject was too big for a tired man to cover. The dying bird expired and lay still.\nAfter a long silence, Helmholtz picked up the trumpet. He kissed the cold mouthpiece and pumped the valves in a dream of a brilliant cadenza. Over the bell of the instrument, Helmholtz saw Jim Donnini\u2019s face, seemingly floating in space\u2014all but deaf and blind. Now Helmholtz saw the futility of men and their treasures. He had thought that his greatest treasure, the trumpet, could buy a soul for Jim. The trumpet was worthless.\nDeliberately, Helmholtz hammered the trumpet against the table edge. He bent it around a coat tree. He handed the wreck to Quinn.\n\"Ya busted it,\" said Quinn, amazed. \"Why\u2019dja do that? What\u2019s that prove?\"\n\"I\u2014I don\u2019t know,\" said Helmholtz. A terrible blasphemy rumbled deep in him, like the warning of a volcano. And then, irresistibly, out it came. \"Life is no damn good,\" said Helmholtz. His face twisted as he fought back tears and shame.\nHelmholtz, the mountain that walked like a man, was falling apart. Jim Donnini\u2019s eyes filled with pity and alarm. They came alive. They became human. Helmholtz had got a message through. Quinn looked at Jim, and something like hope flickered for the first time in his bitterly lonely old face.\nTwo weeks later, a new semester began at Lincoln High.\nIn the band rehearsal room, the members of C Band were waiting for their leader\u2014were waiting for their destinies as musicians to unfold.\nHelmholtz stepped onto the podium, and rattled his baton against his music stand. \"The Voices of Spring,\" he said. \"Everybody hear that?
