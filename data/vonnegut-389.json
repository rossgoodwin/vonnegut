Lasher, the chief instigator of it all, was contented. A lifelong trafficker in symbols, he had created the revolution as a symbol, and was now welcoming the opportunity to die as one.\nAnd that left Paul. \u201cTo a better world,\u201d he started to say, but he cut the toast short, thinking of the people of Ilium, already eager to recreate the same old nightmare.

A reporter from Newsweek telephoned me at that time, and asked me what I thought about two such outsiders being absorbed by the establishment. I replied, \u201cIf we aren\u2019t the establishment, I don\u2019t know who is.\u201d\nAllen was inducted nominally as a poet, but had in fact become world famous for the radiant love and innocence of his person, from head to toe.\nLet us be frank, and admit that the greatest poetry satiates few deep appetites in modern times. But the appearance in our industrialized midst of a man without guile or political goals or congregation, who was doing his utmost to become wise and holy, was for many of us a surprising, anachronistic feast for our souls.\nAllen and I met at a dinner given in Cambridge by the Harvard Lampoon in the late 1960\u2019s. We would hold hands during the ensuing entertainment.\nI had returned from witnessing the end of a civil war in southern Nigeria. The losing side, the rebellious Ibos, had been blockaded. There had been widespread starvation. I was there with my fellow novelist Vance Bourjaily. We arrived on a blockade-running Catholic relief DC-3. We were surrounded at once by starving children begging for mercy. They had distended bellies, everted rectums, hair turned yellow, running sores, that sort of thing. They were also dirty.\nWe were afraid to touch them, lest we get an infection to take back home. But Vance was ashamed of his squeamishness. He said that if Allen Ginsberg had been with us, Allen would have hugged the children, and gone down on his knees and played with them.\nI told this story at the Lampoon dinner, and then said directly to Allen: \u201cWe have not met before, sir, but such is your reputation.\u201d\n\u2014Kurt Vonnegut\nNovember 22, 1997", 0.11497584541062804], "title": "Letters"}}
