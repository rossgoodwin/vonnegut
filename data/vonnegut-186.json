["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhat, in my opinion, was wrong with Mary Kathleen\u2019s scheme for a peaceful economic revolution? For one thing, the federal government was wholly unprepared to operate all the business of RAMJAC on behalf of the people. For another thing: Most of those businesses, rigged only to make profits, were as indifferent to the needs of the people as, say, thunderstorms. Mary Kathleen might as well have left one-fifth of the weather to the people. The businesses of RAMJAC, by their very nature, were as unaffected by the joys and tragedies of human beings as the rain that fell on the night that Madeiros and Sacco and Vanzetti died in an electric chair. It would have rained anyway.\nThe economy is a thoughtless weather system\u2014and nothing more.\nSome joke on the people, to give them such a thing.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere was a supper party given in my honor last week\u2014a \u201cgoing away party,\u201d you might say. It celebrated the completion of my last full day at the office. The host and hostess were Leland Clewes and his lovely wife Sarah. They have not moved out of their basement apartment in Tudor City, nor has Sarah given up private nursing, although Leland is now pulling down about one hundred thousand dollars a year at RAMJAC. Much of their money goes to the Foster Parents Program, a scheme that allows them to support individual children in unfortunate circumstances in many parts of the world. They are supporting fifty children, I think they said. They have letters and photographs from several of them, which they passed around.\nI am something of a hero to certain people, which is a novelty. I single-handedly extended the life of RAMJAC by two years and a little more. If I had not concealed the will of Mary Kathleen, those at the party would never have become vice-presidents of RAMJAC. I myself would have been thrown out on my ear\u2014to become what I expect to be anyway, if I survive my new prison term, which is a shopping-bag man.\nAm I broke again? Yes. My defense has been expensive. Also: My Watergate lawyers have caught up with me. I still owe them a lot for all they did for me.\nClyde Carter, my former guard in Georgia and now a vice-president of the Chrysler Air Temp Division of RAMJAC, was there with his lovely wife, Claudia. He did a side-splitting imitation of his cousin the President, saying, \u201cI will never lie to you,\u201d and promising to rebuild the South Bronx and so on.\nFrank Ubriaco was there with his lovely new wife, Marilyn, who is only seventeen. Frank is fifty-three. They met at a discotheque. They seem very happy. She said that what attracted her to him at first was that he wore a white glove on only one hand. She had to find out why. He told her at first that the hand had been burned by a Chinese communist flame thrower during the Korean War, but later admitted that he had done it to himself with a Fry-o-lator.

When the pilot-navigator died, the whole space ship died.\nUnk went through the smoke to a porthole\u2014 looked out.\nHe saw a fire engine. The fire engine was breaking through the brush to the space ship. Men, women, and children were clinging to the engine\u2014drenched by rain and expressing ecstasy.\nGoing in advance of the fire engine was the Reverend C. Horner Redwine. In one hand he carried a lemon-yellow suit in a transparent plastic bag. In the other hand he held a spray of fresh-cut lilacs.\nThe women threw kisses to Unk through the portholes, held their children up to see the adorable man inside. The men stayed with the fire engine, cheered Unk, cheered each other, cheered everything. The driver made the mighty motor backfire, blew the siren, rang the bell.\nEveryone wore handicaps of some sort. Most handicaps were of an obvious sort\u2014sashweights, bags of shot, old furnace grates\u2014meant to hamper physical advantages. But there were, among Redwine\u2019s parishioners, several true believers who had chosen handicaps of a subtler and more telling kind.\nThere were women who had received by dint of dumb luck the terrific advantage of beauty. They had annihilated that unfair advantage with frumpish clothes, bad posture, chewing gum, and a ghoulish use of cosmetics.\nOne old man, whose only advantage was excellent eyesight, had spoiled that eyesight by wearing his wife\u2019s spectacles.\nA dark young man, whose lithe, predaceous sex appeal could not be spoiled by bad clothes and bad manners, had handicapped himself with a wife who was nauseated by sex.", 0.022115384615384665], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["cancer", 0.38440094413570114], ["simple", 0.17373201852974435], ["answer", 0.14652031334706894], ["inevitable", 0.1459066526749759], ["julian", 0.13568394956926347], ["83", 0.1281336480452337], ["collapsed", 0.1281336480452337], ["approaches", 0.1281336480452337], ["dinner", 0.1281336480452337], ["destiny", 0.11036064341549154], ["fate", 0.11036064341549154], ["break", 0.10463901389461434], ["zah", 0.09996410218194884], ["bo", 0.09996410218194884], ["mah", 0.09996410218194884], ["schlichter", 0.09996410218194884], ["ki", 0.09996410218194884], ["reviewing", 0.09601152064791658], ["start", 0.09601152064791658], ["today", 0.09601152064791658], ["dying", 0.08956756094840618], ["meant", 0.0844221585006587], ["stand", 0.0844221585006587], ["castle", 0.07853724979304556], ["pain", 0.07646946803132948], ["von", 0.07481463415600716], ["koenigswald", 0.07481463415600716], ["point", 0.071794556318664], ["angela", 0.04509061081024961], ["dr", 0.044592711172888023], ["papa", 0.041792729327631825], ["told", 0.035546009259484375], ["asked", 0.03024358840531308]], "sentiment": ["So I asked Julian Castle what zah-mah-ki-bo meant.\n\u201cYou want a simple answer or a whole answer?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with a simple one.\u201d\n\u201cFate\u2014inevitable destiny.\u201d\n83\nDR.

She seemed to like it, and I saw her there now and then after the breakup.\nShe was usually with the type of person both Larry and I had told her she deserved\u2014someone closer to her own age. She also seemed to have chosen persons closer to her own amiable vacuity, which made for lunch hours of sighs, long silences, and the general atmosphere of being fogbound often mistaken for love. Actually, Ellen and her companion were in the miserable condition of not being able to think of anything to say, I\u2019m sure. With Larry, the problem had never come up. It was understood that he was to do the talking, and that when he fell silent, it was a silence for effect, beautiful, to be remembered and unbroken by her. When her escorts focused their attention on the matter of paying the check, Ellen, ever aware of her audience, indicated by restlessness and a look of disdain that this wasn\u2019t the caliber stuff she was used to. And, of course, it wasn\u2019t.\nWhen we happened to be in the restaurant at the same time, she ignored my nods, and\u2014giving less than a damn, really\u2014I gave the practice of nodding up. I think she felt I was part of a plot, somehow in on Larry\u2019s scheme to humiliate her.\nAfter a while, she gave up young men closer to her age in favor of buying her own lunch. And finally, by a coincidence that surprised us both, she found herself seated at the table next to mine, clearing her white throat.\nIt became impossible for me to go on reading my paper. \u201cWell, as I live and breathe,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd how have you been?\u201d she asked coldly. \u201cStill getting lots of laughs?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, lots and lots.

I think Hispanic convicts would have regarded them as the Blacks did, as aardvarks, as exotic creatures who had nothing to do with life as they had experienced it.\nIt seems to me that White convicts, though, might have wanted to kill them or at least beat them up for not caring what became of them any more than they cared what became of Blacks and Hispanics.\nDR. DOLE WENT back to Berlin. At least that is where she said she was going.\nI asked her where she had hidden during the siege. She said she had crawled into the firebox under an old boiler in the basement of this library. It hadn\u2019t been used since before I taught here, but it would have cost a lot of money to move. The school hated to spend money on improvements that didn\u2019t show.\nSO DURING THE siege she was only a few meters away from me while I sat up here and engaged in the wonderful new science of Futurology.\nDR. DOLE SURE didn\u2019t think much of her own country. She ranted on about its sky-high rates of murder and suicide and drug addiction and infant mortality, its low rate of literacy, the fact that it had a higher percentage of its citizens in prison than any other country except for Haiti and South Africa, and didn\u2019t know how to manufacture anything anymore, and put less money into research and primary education than Japan or Korea or any country in East or West Europe, and on and on.\n\u201cAt least we still have freedom of speech,\u201d I said.\nAnd she said, \u201cThat isn\u2019t something somebody else gives you.
