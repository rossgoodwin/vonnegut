for drawing and painting and sculpting and so on. Jane\u2019s and my two daughters, Edith and Nanette, are middle-aged professional artists who have shows and sell pictures. So does our son the doctor Mark. So do I. Allie could have done that, too, if she had been willing to work hard and hustle some. But as I have reported elsewhere, she said, \u201cJust because you\u2019re talented, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to do something with it.\u201d\nI say in my novel Bluebeard, \u201cBeware of gods bearing gifts.\u201d I think I had Allie in mind when I wrote that, and Allie in mind again when, in Timequake One, I had Monica Pepper spray-paint \u201cFUCK ART!\u201d in orange and purple across the steel front door of the Academy. Allie didn\u2019t know there was such an institution as the Academy, I\u2019m almost sure, but she would have been happy to see those words emblazoned anywhere.\nOur father the architect was so full of ecstatic baloney about any work of art Allie made when she was growing up, as though she were the new Michelangelo, that she was shamed. She wasn\u2019t stupid and she wasn\u2019t tasteless. Father, without meaning to do so, rubbed her nose in how limited her gifts were, and so spoiled any modest pleasure that she, not expecting too much, might have found in using them.\nAllie may have felt patronized, too, lavishly praised for very little because she was a pretty girl. Only men could become great artists.\nWhen I was ten, and Allie was fifteen, and our big brother Bernie the born scientist was eighteen, I said at supper one night that women weren\u2019t even the best cooks or clothing makers. Men were. And Mother dumped a pitcher of water over my head.\nBut Mother was as full of baloney about Allie\u2019s prospects for marrying a rich man, and how important it was for Allie to do so, as Father was about the art she did. During the Great Depression, financial sacrifices were made to send Allie to school with Hoosier heiresses at Tudor Hall, School for Girls, or Two-Door Hell, Dump for Dames, four blocks south of Shortridge High School, where she could have received what I received, a free and much richer and more democratic and madly heterosexual education.\nThe parents of my first wife Jane, Harvey and Riah Cox, did the same thing: sent their only daughter to Tudor Hall, and bought her rich girls\u2019 clothes, and maintained for her sake membership in the Woodstock Golf and Country Club they could ill afford, so she could marry a man whose family had money and power.\nWhen the Great Depression and then World War Two were over, the idea that a man from a rich and powerful Indianapolis family would be allowed to marry a woman whose family didn\u2019t have a pot to piss in, as long as she had the manners and tastes of a rich girl, turned out to be as dumb as trying to sell balloons with blobs of moistened clay inside.\nBusiness is business.\nThe best Allie could do for a husband was Jim Adams, a beautiful, charming, funny hunk with no money and no profession, who had served in Army Public Relations during the war. The best Jane could do, and it was a time of panic for unmarried women, was a guy who came home a PFC, who had been flunking all his courses at Cornell when he went off to war, and who didn\u2019t have a clue as to what to do next, now that free will had kicked in again.", 0.21686573842823842], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["newt", 0.49305952726498237],

It would have been nice to take a bath, and to go to bed between clean sheets, and to sleep until I died.\nThere was more to come. Six policemen were still in the basement with me\u2014three in uniform and three in plain clothes, and all with pistols. I could name the manufacturers of the pistols, and their calibers. There wasn\u2019t a pistol there that I couldn\u2019t have taken apart and cleaned properly, and put together again. I knew where the drops of oil should go. If they had put their pistols in my hands, I could have made them this guarantee: The pistols would never jam.\nIt can be a very frustrating thing if a pistol jams.\nThe six remaining policemen were the producers of the Rudy Waltz Snow, and their poses in the basement indicated that we had reached an intermission, that there was more to come. They ignored me for the moment, as though a curtain had descended.\nThey were electrified by a call from upstairs. \u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d was the call, as a door upstairs opened and shut. They echoed that. \u201cHe\u2019s here, he\u2019s here.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t say who it was, but it was somebody somehow marvelous. Now I heard his footsteps on the stairs.\nI thought it might be an executioner. I thought it might be Police Chief Francis X. Morissey, that old family friend, who had yet to show himself. I thought it might be my father.\nIt was George Metzger, the thirty-five-year-old widower of the woman I had shot. He was fifteen years younger than I am now, a mere spring chicken\u2014but, as children will, I saw him as an old man. He was bald on top. He was skinny, and his posture was bad, and he was dressed like almost no other man in Midland City\u2014in gray flannel trousers and a tweed sport coat, what I would recognize much later at Ohio State as the uniform of an English professor. All he did was write and edit at the Bugle-Observer all day long.\nI did not know who he was. He had never been to our house. He had been in town only a year. He was a newspaper gypsy. He had been hired away from the Indianapolis Times. It would come out at legal proceedings later on that he was born to poor parents in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and had put himself through Harvard, and that he had twice worked his way to Europe on cattle boats. The adverse information about him, which was brought out by our lawyer, was that he had once belonged to the Communist party, and had attempted to enlist in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.\nHe wore horn-rimmed spectacles, and his eyes were red from crying, or maybe from too much cigarette smoke. He was smoking when he came down the stairs, followed by the detective who had gone to get him. He behaved as though he himself were a criminal, puffing on the same cigarette he would be smoking when he was propped against the basement wall in front of a firing squad.\nI wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if the police had shot this unhappy stranger while I watched. I was beyond surprise. I am still beyond surprise. The consequences of my having shot a pregnant woman were bound to be complicated beyond belief.", 0.009777537277537302], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["pope",

Vice-Bundesfuehrer of the German-American Bund. Krapptauer was sixty-three, had done eleven years in Atlanta, was about to drop dead. But he still looked garishly boyish, as though he went to a mortuary cosmetologist regularly. The greatest achievement of his life was the arrangement of a joint meeting of the Bund and the Ku Klux Klan in New Jersey in 1940. At that meeting, Krapptauer declared that the Pope was a Jew and that the Jews held a fifteen-million-dollar mortgage on the Vatican. A change of Popes and eleven years in a prison laundry had not changed his mind.\nJones\u2019 secretary was an unfrocked Paulist Father named Patrick Keeley. \u201cFather Keeley,\u201d as his employer still called him, was seventy-three. He was a drunk. He had, before the Second World War, been chaplain of a Detroit gun club which, as later came out, had been organized by agents of Nazi Germany. The dream of the club, apparently, was to shoot the Jews. One of Father Keeley\u2019s prayers at a club meeting was taken down by a newspaper reporter, was printed in full the next morning. The prayer appealed to so vicious and bigoted a God that it attracted the astonished attention of Pope Pius XI.\nKeeley was unfrocked, and Pope Pius sent a long letter to the American Hierarchy in which he said, among other things: \u201cNo true Catholic will take part in the persecution of his Jewish compatriots. A blow against the Jews is a blow against our common humanity.\u201d\nKeeley never went to prison, though many of his close friends did. While his friends enjoyed steam heat, clean beds and regular meals at government expense, Keeley shivered and itched and starved and drank himself blind on skid rows across the land. He would have been on a skid row still, or in a pauper\u2019s grave, if Jones and Krapptauer hadn\u2019t found and rescued him.\nKeeley\u2019s famous prayer, incidentally, was a paraphrase of a satiric poem I had composed and delivered on short wave before. And, while I am setting the record straight as to my contributions to literature, may I point out that Vice-Bundesfuehrer Krapptauer\u2019s claims about the Pope and the mortgage on the Vatican were my inventions, too.\nSo up the stairs these people came to see me, chanting, \u201cOne, two, three, four. \u2026\u201d\nAnd, slow as their progress was, the fourth member of the party lagged far behind.\nThe fourth member was a woman. All I could see of her was her pale and ringless hand.\nThe hand of Jones was in the lead. It glittered with rings like the hand of a Byzantine prince. An inventory of the jewelry on that hand would have revealed two wedding rings, a star-sapphire presented to him by the Mothers\u2019 Auxiliary of the Paul Revere Association of Militant Gentiles in 1940, a diamond swastika on an onyx field presented to him in 1939 by Baron Manfred Freiherr von Killinger, then German Consul General of San Francisco, and an American eagle carved in jade and mounted in silver, a piece of Japanese craftsmanship, a present from Robert Sterling Wilson. Wilson was \u201cThe Black Fuehrer of Harlem,\u201d a colored man who went to prison in 1942 as a Japanese spy.\nThe jewelled hand of Jones left the bannister. Jones cantered back down the stairs to the woman, said things to her I couldn\u2019t understand. And then up he came again, a remarkably sound-winded septuagenarian.", 0.017561167227833893], "title": "Mother Night"}, "we-are-what-we-pretend-to-be": {"tfidf": [["ms", 0.05453671188782693],

in Knightsbridge, indeed \u201cuncharacteristic,\u201d \u201catypical,\u201d and \u201cone hundred percent anomalous.\u201d Ms. Florence Pate Glass, an English teacher at Knightsbridge High, where Berman had been president of the National Honor Society, testified: \u201cGilbert never fought, or even considered fighting. If there was a confrontation, Gilbert always turned the other cheek, although he was as manly and strong as three-quarters of the boys here. In one essay he wrote for me, and he was one of the eight best students I ever had, he said a formula as earthshaking as Einstein\u2019s \u2018E equals MC square.\u2019 It was \u2018Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.\u2019 No more \u2018An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 No more revenge!\u201d\nThe reporter asked Ms. Glass, since the business about forgiving trespasses was in the New Testament, if Berman had shown an interest in Christianity while in high school. \u201cOn a sub-zero Christmas day in Hell,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I remember Gilbert asked me one time, \u2018Ms. Glass, if what Jesus said was good, why should anybody care a rat\u2019s ass whether he was God or not?\u2019\u201d\nMs. Glass said: \u201cOne thing really puzzles me though, along with beating up that poor woman, of course, is that he is now a comedian. I saw him on the Tonight Show two weeks ago, and I couldn\u2019t believe how funny he was. He used to be the most serious boy in Knightsbridge, too serious, I thought. I wanted to say to him, \u2018Gilbert Lanz Berman, can\u2019t you put down the world and all its troubles for at least ten minutes? It\u2019ll still be there when you pick it up again.\u2019\u201d\nMs. Glass asked the reporter what drugs Berman had been taking when he beat up his wife and was told it was alcohol and nothing else, and she said, \u201cSometimes all it takes is two martinis to transmogrify Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde.\u201d\nCHAPTER 2\nBerman\u2019s Knightsbridge biology teacher, Dr. Aaron Edelman, termed him \u201can ardent Schweitzerite, a fully committed reverence-for-lifer.\u201d Edelman said, \u201cIt could be said of Gilbert as literally as it could have been said of his hero, Dr. Albert Schweitzer: \u2018He wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly.\u2019 I remember one time in the lab a cockroach ran across the floor, and a student named Cynthia Gottlieb stepped on it. And Gilbert said to her in that rich voice of his, \u2018Cynthia, I can\u2019t tell you how much I wish you hadn\u2019t done that.\u2019\u201d\nA possible \u201cextenuating circumstance,\u201d according to the Globe: \u201cHis father, the prominent Boston orthodontist Dr. Robert Berman, also runner-up two years in a row in the Wianno Pro-Am Tournament on Cape Cod, 1968 and 1969, committed suicide four years ago.\u201d\nThe denouement? Wanda Lightfoot through her lawyers asked for and received in absentia an uncontested divorce, a flat $1 million settlement, no alimony, no child support, and an order of protection against her ex-husband. That last was purely symbolic, since she had already left the state with the baby still inside her, and was having her name legally changed so that Berman could never find her. Berman in the year 2000: \u201cThat was back when a million was a lot of money. Nowadays you couldn\u2019t buy a cross-eyed shortstop for a season in the basement with the Seattle Mariners for twice that much.\u201d\nIn the year 1978 a reporter happened to spot Gil Berman at Logan Airport as Berman, in obedience to a court order, was about to leave for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where a bus from the Caldwell Institute would meet him. He asked Berman what it felt like to give away a million dollars. And Gil Berman said this, appearing terribly weary and humbled, and not acting funny at all, according to the reporter: \u201cTabula rasa, friend. I feel like shit but my slate is clean.\u201d\nDr. Robert Berman, DDS, committed suicide in the autumn of 1977 at the age of forty-two, his son Gilbert\u2019s age there onstage at the Calvin Theater in the year 2000. Dr. Berman, DDS, did the big trick by means of carbon monoxide while sitting in his BMW convertible, with his seatbelt fastened and the top down in a closed garage on Cape Cod. The garage belonged to Mrs. Arnold Kirschenberg, a young and recent widow, a former girlfriend from Barnstable High School who, like Dr. Berman, had married a lot of money. She lived next door to the waterfront estate of the Kennedys in Hyannis Port, where the murdered brothers John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Robert Francis Kennedy had learned to swim and sail.",

they pleased. They would inevitably surface within a rectangle of barbed wire, would find themselves greeted listlessly by dying Russians who spoke no English, who had no food or useful information or escape plans of their own. They could scheme all they pleased to hide aboard a vehicle or steal one, but no vehicle ever came into their compound. They could feign illness, if they liked, but that wouldn\u2019t earn them a trip anywhere, either. The only hospital in the camp was a six-bed affair in the British compound itself.\nThe Englishmen were clean and enthusiastic and decent and strong. They sang boomingly well. They had been singing together every night for years.\nThe Englishmen had also been lifting weights and chinning themselves for years. Their bellies were like washboards. The muscles of their calves and upper arms were like cannonballs. They were all masters of checkers and chess and bridge and cribbage and dominoes and anagrams and charades and Ping-Pong and billiards, as well.\nThey were among the wealthiest people in Europe, in terms of food. A clerical error early in the war, when food was still getting through to prisoners, had caused the Red Cross to ship them five hundred parcels every month instead of fifty. The Englishmen had hoarded these so cunningly that now, as the war was ending, they had three tons of sugar, one ton of coffee, eleven hundred pounds of chocolate, seven hundred pounds of tobacco, seventeen hundred pounds of tea, two tons of flour, one ton of canned beef, twelve hundred pounds of canned butter, sixteen hundred pounds of canned cheese, eight hundred pounds of powdered milk, and two tons of orange marmalade.\nThey kept all this in a room without windows. They had ratproofed it by lining it with flattened tin cans.\nThey were adored by the Germans, who thought they were exactly what Englishmen ought to be. They made war look stylish and reasonable, and fun. So the Germans let them have four sheds, though one shed would have held them all. And, in exchange for coffee or chocolate or tobacco, the Germans gave them paint and lumber and nails and cloth for fixing things up.\nThe Englishmen had known for twelve hours that American guests were on their way. They had never had guests before, and they went to work like darling elves, sweeping, mopping, cooking, baking\u2014making mattresses of straw and burlap bags, setting tables, putting party favors at each place.\nNow they were singing their welcome to their guests in the winter night. Their clothes were aromatic with the feast they had been preparing. They were dressed half for battle, half for tennis or croquet. They were so elated by their own hospitality, and by all the goodies waiting inside, that they did not take a good look at their guests while they sang. And they imagined that they were singing to fellow officers fresh from the fray.\nThey wrestled the Americans toward the shed door affectionately, filling the night with manly blather and brotherly rodomontades. They called them \u201cYank,\u201d told them \u201cGood show,\u201d promised them that \u201cJerry was on the run,\u201d and so on.\nBilly Pilgrim wondered dimly who Jerry was.", 0.2527777777777777], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["noel", 0.20177509960178577], ["hotel", 0.10835777537233288], ["multi", 0.10604529935315377], ["chambermaid", 0.09296705066334349], ["fern", 0.08647504268647963], ["discovery", 0.08531676560469888], ["waters", 0.07567854628835943], ["account", 0.06681055328372291], ["street", 0.06458823185624397], ["constant", 0.05897255970786478], ["detailed", 0.05302264967657688], ["staying", 0.05302264967657688], ["erect", 0.05302264967657688], ["fuddled", 0.05302264967657688], ["crooked", 0.05302264967657688], ["scales", 0.05302264967657688], ["histories", 0.05302264967657688], ["crowther", 0.05302264967657688], ["shrewdest", 0.05302264967657688], ["prudence", 0.05302264967657688], ["primordial", 0.05302264967657688], ["hire", 0.05302264967657688], ["romantic", 0.05302264967657688], ["checking", 0.05302264967657688], ["millionaire", 0.05302264967657688], ["owns", 0.05302264967657688], ["crankshaft", 0.05302264967657688], ["lavina", 0.05302264967657688], ["pans", 0.04648352533167174], ["pots", 0.04648352533167174], ["gomburg", 0.04648352533167174], ["libraries", 0.04648352533167174], ["hired", 0.04648352533167174], ["pregnant", 0.04648352533167174], ["whitehill", 0.04648352533167174], ["lot", 0.04457177976784279], ["manager", 0.04265838280234944], ["harsh", 0.04265838280234944], ["florence", 0.04265838280234944], ["volume", 0.04265838280234944], ["details", 0.04265838280234944], ["thorough", 0.0399444009867666], ["married", 0.0399444009867666], ["dream", 0.0399444009867666], ["sir", 0.037839273144179716], ["crash", 0.037839273144179716], ["build", 0.03611925845744429], ["advantage", 0.03611925845744429], ["public", 0.03466500676096072], ["finger", 0.03466500676096072], ["mansion", 0.03340527664186146], ["moving", 0.03340527664186146], ["baby", 0.03340527664186146], ["wilburhampton", 0.03229411592812199], ["building", 0.03130014879927456], ["wild", 0.03130014879927456], ["223", 0.030400996159611126], ["coming", 0.030400996159611126], ["bring", 0.030400996159611126], ["opus", 0.029580134112539146], ["magnum", 0.029580134112539146], ["girl", 0.028125882416055577], ["business", 0.025754991583216844], ["asked", 0.025244923458025564], ["going", 0.024333349536430546], ["point", 0.024300739886733272], ["held", 0.024300739886733272], ["dollars", 0.024300739886733272], ["malachi", 0.024086706487989926], ["child", 0.023861871814705983], ["days", 0.023041009767634003], ["better", 0.022285889883921394], ["father", 0.02158675807115043], ["ten", 0.02093588192504712], ["room", 0.02093588192504712], ["boy", 0.02093588192504712], ["day", 0.019215867238311698], ["luck", 0.01895738634974458], ["told", 0.018221900109464277], ["thing", 0.014240820769281496], ["head", 0.013936473012505824]], "sentiment": ["\"In my head,\" said Noel Constant.\n\"There is one more advantage I have yet to point out,\" said Fern. \"Some day your luck is going to run out.

So that almost everybody still intent on going would be on that special flight from New York City.\nAnd now King\u2019s secretary came into his office to tell him that she had just heard on the radio that the State Department had just advised American citizens not to travel in Ecuador at the present time.\nSo that was that for what King considered the finest piece of work he had ever done. Without knowing anything about naval architecture, he had made a ship more attractive by persuading its owners not to call it, as they were about to do, the Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, but the Bah\u00eda de Darwin. He had transformed what was to have been a routine, two-week trip out to the islands and back into the nature cruise of the century. How had he worked such a miracle? By never calling it anything but \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d\nIf, as now seemed certain to King, the Bah\u00eda de Darwin would not set out on \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d at noon the next day, certain side effects of his campaign would endure. He had taught people a lot of natural history with his publicity releases about the wonders which Mrs. Onassis and Dr. Kissinger and Mick Jagger and so on would see. He had created two new celebrities: Robert P\u00e9pin, the chef King had declared to be \u201cthe greatest chef in France\u201d after hiring him to run the galley for the maiden voyage, and Captain Adolf von Kleist, the captain of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, who, with his big nose and air of hiding some unspeakable personal tragedy from the world, had turned out to be on television talk shows a first-rate comedian.\nKing had in his files a transcript of the Captain\u2019s performance on The Tonight Show, starring Johnny Carson. On that show, as on all the others, the Captain was dazzling in the gold-and-white uniform he was entitled to wear as an admiral in the Ecuadorian Naval Reserve. The transcript went like this:\nCARSON: \u201cVon Kleist\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like a very South American name somehow.\nCAPTAIN: It\u2019s Inca\u2014one of the commonest Inca names, in fact, like \u201cSmith\u201d or \u201cJones\u201d in English.
