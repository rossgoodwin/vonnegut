The dog was crazy. Satan hadn\u2019t bitten anybody yet\u2014but if he ever did, he\u2019d bite to kill.\nThen Charley saw what Satan was barking at. Satan was cantering alongside of a boy on a bicycle, showing teeth like butcher knives. He was swinging his head from side to side, barking, and slashing air with those awful teeth.\nThe boy looked straight ahead, pretending the dog wasn\u2019t there. He was the bravest human being Charley had ever seen. The hero was Mark Crosby, the ten-year-old newsboy.\n\u201cMark\u2014\u201d said Charley. The dog came after Charley now, did his best to turn Charley\u2019s thinning hair white with those butcher-knife teeth. If the boy hadn\u2019t set such high standards for bravery, Charley might have made a dive for the safety of the patrol car. \u201cYou seen anything of Mr. Hedlund, Mark?\u201d said Charley.\n\u201cNosir,\u201d said Mark, giving Charley\u2019s uniform the respect it deserved. He put the Saturday paper on top of the pile on the doorstep, put it under the brick. \u201cHe\u2019s been gone all week, sir.\u201d\nSatan finally got bored with these two unscarable human beings. He lay down on the porch with a tremendous thump, and snarled lazily from time to time.\n\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?

Almost everything he exclaimed about was really going on.\nHe was wonderful about inventors and machines.\nThe inscription on his tombstone is the one with which I began this essay. Erika Ostrovsky calls it a \u201cterse summary of a double life.\u201d\nGood for her.\nHe expected his writings to live on and on. He described himself when he was about to die like this: \u201c\u2026 by your leave, a writer, a terrific stylist, the living proof: they put me in the \u2019Pleiade\u2019 with La Fontaine, Clement Marot, du Bellay \u2026 not to mention Rabelais! and Ronsard! \u2026 just to show you that I\u2019m not worried \u2026 in two or three centuries I\u2019ll be helping the kids through high school \u2026\u201d\nAt the time I write, which is the autumn of 1974, it has become apparent even to ordinary people, with their mental dampers operating perfectly, that life is in fact as dangerous and unforgiving and irrational as C\u00e9line said it was. There is some question as to whether we have two or three centuries remaining to us in which to prepare civilization for the teaching of C\u00e9line in high school.\nUntil that day, if it comes, I suspect that fellow writers will keep his reputation alive. We are especially shocked and enlightened by what he says. We are filled with a giddy sort of gratitude.\nI have heard it suggested that C\u00e9line may live on far longer in English than in French\u2014for technical rather than political reasons. The argument goes that C\u00e9line\u2019s gutter French was so specialized as to time and place that gobs of it are incomprehensible to Frenchmen.\nThose who have translated it into English, however, have used more durable crudities, which will be clear enough still, God willing, in one hundred years.\nAs I say, this is not my idea. I heard it somewhere. I pass it on. If it turns out to be true, it seems that simple literary justice would eventually require that his translators be acknowledged as coauthors of C\u00e9line.

He might never have told me about it, in my opinion, if a documentary about the Japanese \u201cRape of Nanking\u201d hadn\u2019t been shown on the prison TVs the day before.

There were evidently movie cameras everywhere, run by gosh knows whom, and the footage wasn\u2019t confiscated afterward.\nI had seen some of the footage when I was a cadet, but not as a part of a well-edited documentary, with a baritone voice-over and appropriate music underneath.\nThe orgy of butchery followed a virtually unopposed attack by the Japanese Army on the Chinese city of Nanking in 1937, long before this country became part of the Finale Rack. Hiroshi Matsumoto had just been born. Prisoners were tied to stakes and used for bayonet practice. Several people in a pit were buried alive. You could see their expressions as the dirt hit their faces.\nTheir faces disappeared, but the dirt on top kept moving as though there were some sort of burrowing animal, a woodchuck maybe, making a home below.\nUnforgettable!\nHOW WAS THAT for racism?\nTHE DOCUMENTARY WAS a big hit in the prison.

cousin of Kurt\u2019s. Alex is Kurt\u2019s uncle, his father\u2019s brother. Aunt Irma is Kurt\u2019s father\u2019s sister. Raye is a cousin. Kurt \u201cTiger\u201d Adams is the third son of Kurt\u2019s sister Alice and her husband, Jim.\nDearest Emmie\u2014\nI thank you for your warm letter. You are nice to worry about me. I owe it to you to explain how I am and what I have been doing. The main thing, Emmie, is that I see my children all the time. I live in the same city with Edith, and see her a couple of times a week. Steve and Mark are now in town. We had supper together last night, and they spent the night here, and I will see them on the Cape this weekend. I visited Tiger a couple of weeks ago, and go to Jamaica to see Jim, and so on. So I in fact still head up a vivid and loving family, and will become a grandfather whenever someone decides to reproduce. Jane and I are no longer good companions. I am sorry about that, and so is she. This happens sometimes. There is no hatred between us. We talk often on the telephone, and she has worked out a quite satisfactory, by no means lonely, life of her own.\nAs for my unhappiness in the presence of Alex & Raye & Irma: you mustn\u2019t tell them this, but they are no good at keeping secrets, although they imagine themselves reserved and poker-faced. And they have made it clear without knowing it that they are in awe of what I dislike most about myself, the tin-horn part, the fame, and that they consider what I actually write or think as popular garbage for hippies. I dedicated my own favorite book to Alex, and he said he couldn\u2019t read it, but he supposed that the young people liked it. So that is O.K., really. I love those people, so I go see them as often as I can, and I call them up a lot. But it is very hard to talk to them. Emotionally we are nearly one flesh. Intellectually we are far, far away. And they are too old to be interested in my explanations of myself. So I don\u2019t explain. So my unhappiness in Indianapolis boils down to a profound uneasiness about being loved for everything except for what I really do. And about having to keep my mouth shut about politics and about the arts since 1914.\nI would love to see you, and beg you to call me whenever you are near New York. You and I are both in reasonably good shape, it seems to me, considering how long we\u2019ve lived. I will explain to you the nature of my profession, which is necessarily a bizarre and risky enterprise.\nMuch love\u2014\nK", 0.21589474288337918], "title": "Letters"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["indians", 0.27048358410516], ["soup", 0.24856655123444837], ["blue", 0.21109913606904593], ["kid", 0.1834869401898032], ["loopo", 0.1539754996352812], ["heavily", 0.1539754996352812], ["unenterprising", 0.1539754996352812], ["thick", 0.1539754996352812], ["saved", 0.1539754996352812], ["chemical", 0.1539754996352812], ["peaceful", 0.1539754996352812], ["castration", 0.1539754996352812], ["lupi", 0.1539754996352812], ["sapped", 0.1539754996352812], ["drugged", 0.1539754996352812], ["thin", 0.1539754996352812], ["starvation", 0.1539754996352812], ["years", 0.13846482543655433], ["hanging", 0.13524179205258], ["sleepy", 0.13524179205258], ["fed", 0.13524179205258], ["strange", 0.13524179205258], ["form", 0.13524179205258], ["half", 0.12428327561722419], ["guys", 0.10138333344459706], ["long", 0.0807849536595458], ["will", 0.06697885571992443], ["shuttle", 0.039934750846737775], ["looseleaf", 0.03915130390421745], ["paul", 0.02413709302086886], ["harold", 0.012608739539448343]], "sentiment": ["Eight years you guys were together-through thick and thin.\nHAROLD\nFor seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.
