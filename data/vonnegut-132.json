shall never believe that God plays dice with the world.\u201d Bernard was himself so open-minded about how the universe might be dealt with that he thought praying would help, possibly, in drastic situations. When his son Terry had cancer of the throat, Bernie, ever the experimentalist, prayed for his recovery. Terry indeed survived.\nSo it was with silver iodide, too. Bernie wondered if crystals of that substance, so like crystals of frozen water, might not teach supercooled droplets in clouds how to turn to ice, to snow. He tried it. It worked.\nHe spent the final decade of his professional life attempting to discredit a very old and widely respected paradigm of whence came electrical charges in thunderstorms, and where they went, and what they did and why. He was opposed. The last of the more than one hundred fifty articles he wrote, to be published posthumously, describes experiments that can demonstrate incontrovertibly whether he was right or wrong.\nEither way, he could not lose. However the experiments came out, he would have found the results enormously entertaining. Either way, he would have laughed like hell.\nHe was funnier than I am in conversation. During the Great Depression, I learned as much about jokes while tagging after him as I did from the comedians in movies and on the radio. I was honored that he found me funny, too. It turned out that he had accumulated a small portfolio of my stuff that had amused him. One item was a letter I had written to our uncle Alex when I was twenty-five. At that time, I had published nothing, had a wife and son, and had just come from Chicago to work as a flack for General Electric in Schenectady, New York.\nI got that job because Bernie had become a celebrity in the GE Research Laboratory, in association with Irving Langmuir and Vincent Schaefer, for experiments with cloud seeding, and because the company decided to have regular newspaper people handle its publicity. At Bernie\u2019s suggestion, GE hired me away from the Chicago City News Bureau, where I had been a beat reporter. I had worked simultaneously for a master\u2019s degree in anthropology at the University of Chicago.\nI thought Uncle Alex knew that Bernie and I were at GE then, and that I was in Publicity. He didn\u2019t know!\nAnd Uncle Alex had seen a syndicated photograph of Bernie, credited to the Schenectady Gazette. He wrote to that paper, saying he was \u201ca wee bit proud\u201d of his nephew and would like a copy of the picture. He enclosed a dollar.

Twenty-four hours of sleeplessness had made her, in my eyes, anyway, an idealized representative of compassionate, long-suffering women of all ages everywhere. She denied that she was a nurse, but she was a nurse anyway, without vanity or guile.\nI have a tendency, anyway, to swoon secretly in the presence of nurturing women, since my own mother was such a cold and aggressively helpless old bat.\nWho was this profoundly beautiful and unselfish woman behind the counter? What a surprise! This was Celia Hoover, n\u00e9e Hildreth, the wife of the Pontiac dealer\u2014once believed to be the dumbest girl in high school. I wanted Felix to get a look at her, but I could not spot him anywhere. The last time he had seen her, she had been cutting through a vacant lot in the nighttime, way back in 1943.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nShe was a robot in back of the counter. Her memory was blasted by weariness. I asked her if Mr. and Mrs. Otto Waltz were in the hospital, and she looked in a card file. She told me mechanically that Otto Waltz was in intensive care, in critical condition, and could not have visitors, and that Emma Wetzel Waltz was not in serious condition, and had been given a bed in a makeshift ward which had been set up in the basement.\nSo there was a member of our distinguished family down in a basement again.\nI had never been in the basement of the hospital before. But I had known this much about it even when I was a little boy: That was where they had the city morgue.\nThat had been the first stop for Eloise Metzger, after I shot her between the eyes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", -0.09665555555555555], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["aspirin", 0.3226351137347444], ["jew", 0.18158245062895792], ["kidnap", 0.1613175568673722], ["disbelief", 0.1613175568673722], ["headache", 0.1613175568673722], ["groping", 0.1613175568673722], ["piffling", 0.1613175568673722], ["ain", 0.14093087508619734], ["send", 0.12900543073007487], ["advice", 0.12900543073007487], ["murmured", 0.12054419330502247], ["prisoner", 0.11398114767813396], ["adolf", 0.1086187489489], ["republic", 0.1086187489489], ["eichmann", 0.10015751152384762], ["government", 0.09359446589695909], ["resi", 0.09020901264171927], ["paper", 0.08587786988320935], ["won", 0.08587786988320935], ["israel", 0.083698223643394], ["fuehrer", 0.07977082974267276], ["work", 0.07471641042130042], ["jews", 0.07177277928727153], ["black", 0.06784538538655027], ["men", 0.06664473848889571], ["dr", 0.06331154186221914], ["asked", 0.055114088848424427], ["jones", 0.05001786175212923], ["things", 0.047458703605375414], ["american", 0.047458703605375414], ["will", 0.04567562649312733]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHeadache?\u201d he asked me.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\u201cTake a aspirin,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThank you for the advice,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMost things in this world don\u2019t work\u2014\u201d he said, \u201cbut aspirin do.\u201d\n\u201cThe\u2014the Republic of Israel really wants me\u2014\u201d I said to Resi in groping disbelief, \u201cto\u2014to try me for\u2014for what the paper said?\u201d\n\u201cDr. Jones says the American Government won\u2019t let you go\u2014\u201d said Resi, \u201cbut that the Jews will send men to kidnap you, the way they did Adolf Eichmann.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a piffling prisoner\u2014\u201d I murmured.\n\u201cAin\u2019t like just having a Jew here and a Jew there after you,\u201d said the Black Fuehrer.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.", 0.011111111111111118], "title": "Mother Night"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["rumfoord", 0.17374046360453624], ["secret", 0.10905094158018637], ["lily", 0.09828383000830755], ["success", 0.08027647738903879], ["force", 0.07371287250623067], ["volume", 0.06918612250007966], ["official", 0.06269868077034904], ["twenty", 0.058855931504481304], ["raid", 0.058095767611120536], ["dresden", 0.057054645135639806], ["air", 0.048517141518262405], ["wonderful", 0.04512088415165928], ["history", 0.040517970992430784], ["foreign", 0.04013823869451939], ["profession", 0.04013823869451939], ["occupied", 0.04013823869451939], ["clearly", 0.04013823869451939], ["readable", 0.04013823869451939], ["intelligently", 0.04013823869451939], ["standpoint", 0.04013823869451939], ["condensation", 0.04013823869451939], ["howling", 0.04013823869451939], ["medical", 0.04013823869451939], ["veterinarian", 0.04013823869451939], ["volumes", 0.04013823869451939], ["hearts", 0.04013823869451939], ["army", 0.036947674171403426], ["human", 0.03494506388413933], ["interpreter", 0.03459306125003983], ["treat", 0.03459306125003983], ["serve", 0.03459306125003983], ["extent", 0.03459306125003983], ["considered", 0.03459306125003983], ["repulsive", 0.03459306125003983], ["ears", 0.03459306125003983], ["life", 0.03316545372237574], ["learning", 0.03134934038517452], ["bleeding", 0.03134934038517452], ["seriously", 0.03134934038517452], ["difficult", 0.03134934038517452], ["explained", 0.03134934038517452], ["language", 0.03134934038517452], ["problem", 0.03134934038517452], ["heard", 0.02942761610347166], ["worth", 0.029047883805560268], ["bombing", 0.029047883805560268], ["hiroshima", 0.029047883805560268], ["fear", 0.027262735395046592], ["finally", 0.027262735395046592], ["long", 0.026961205226235525], ["lot", 0.0258573192824443], ["surgeon", 0.025804162940694955], ["point", 0.024570957502076888], ["worse", 0.024570957502076888], ["doctors", 0.024570957502076888], ["tree", 0.024570957502076888], ["beings", 0.02350270636108071], ["turn", 0.02350270636108071], ["talked", 0.02256044207582964], ["spoke", 0.02256044207582964], ["thing", 0.022075098833416615], ["speaking", 0.02171755795056703], ["war", 0.021138272324010644], ["russians", 0.020955076512132433], ["years", 0.019729443246346613], ["better", 0.0196186438348271], ["person", 0.017957528916601146], ["germans", 0.01658272686118787], ["supposed", 0.015782059192732012], ["course", 0.015054284967086197], ["wanted", 0.012666341058638224], ["american", 0.012666341058638224], ["book", 0.011470087186870516], ["dead", 0.011037549416708307], ["three", 0.010829745525482224], ["americans", 0.010429662160884933], ["billy", 0.008203819257700272], ["people", 0.00686717402764202], ["pilgrim", 0.005705717948886036], ["time", 0.005082025617128341]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThat\u2019s not a human being anymore.

Her eyes were red and her face was puffy with weeping, despair.\n\"The lieutenant-colonel, moreover, knew her. She was a woman that a fortune teller had promised him would one day bear his child,\" said Rumfoord. \"She had been so high and proud the last time he saw her, and was now so crushed, that even the heartless lieutenant-colonel was moved.\n\"The lieutenant-colonel realized for the first time what most people never realize about themselves\u2014that he was not only a victim of outrageous fortune, but one of outrageous fortune\u2019s cruelest agents as well. The woman had regarded him as a pig when they met before. He had now proved beyond question that he was a pig.\n\"As the crew had predicted,\" said Rumfoord, \"the lieutenant-colonel was spoiled forever as a soldier. He became hopelessly engrossed in the intricate tactics of causing less rather than more pain. Proof of his success would be his winning of the woman\u2019s forgiveness and understanding.\n\"When the space ship reached Mars, he learned from loose talk in the Reception Center Hospital that he was about to have his memory taken away.

The first letter was all about the woman he had wronged.\n\"He looked for her after his amnesia treatment, and found that she had no recollection of him. Not only that, she was pregnant, carrying his child. His problem, thereupon, became to win her love, and through her, to win the love of her child.\n\"This he attempted to do, Unk,\" said Rumfoord, \"not once, but many times. He was consistently defeated. But it remained the central problem of his life\u2014probably because he himself had come from a shattered family.\n\"What defeated him, Unk,\" said Rumfoord, \"was a congenital coldness on the part of the woman, and a system of psychiatry that took the ideals of Martian society as noble common sense. Each time the man wobbled his mate, utterly humorless psychiatry straightened her out\u2014made her an efficient citizen again.\n\"Both the man and his mate were frequent visitors to the psychiatric wards of their respective hospitals. And it is perhaps food for thought,\" said Rumfoord, \"that this supremely frustrated man was the only Martian to write a philosophy, and that this supremely self-frustrating woman was the only Martian to write a poem.\"\nBoaz arrived at the company mother ship from the town of Phoebe, where he had gone to look for Unk. \"God damn\u2014\" he said to Rumfoord, \"everybody go and leave without us?\" He was on a bicycle.", 0.11732824086482621], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "galapagos": {"tfidf": [["robert", 0.13086721181517738], ["donald", 0.11536935618247297], ["wojciehowitz",

She turned him down, and let him know that it was certainly too early for her to start dating again.\nShe did everything she could to discourage him, but he came to see her one afternoon anyway, even though she had said she very much wished to be alone. He drove up to her house while she was mowing the lawn. He made her shut off the mower, and then he blurted out a marriage proposal.\nMary would describe his car to Akiko, and make Akiko laugh about it, even though Akiko had never seen and never would see any sort of automobile. Robert Wojciehowitz drove a Jaguar which used to be very beautiful, but which was now all scored and dented on the driver\u2019s side. The car was a gift from his wife while she was dying. Her name was *Doris, a name Akiko would give to one of her furry daughters, simply because of Mary\u2019s story.\n*Doris Wojciehowitz had inherited a little money, and she bought the Jaguar for her husband as a way of thanking him for having been such a good husband. They had a grown son named Joseph, and he was a lout, and he wrecked the beautiful Jaguar while his mother was still alive. Joseph was sent to jail for a year\u2014as a punishment for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.\nThere is our brain-shrinking old friend alcohol again.\nRobert\u2019s marriage proposal took place on the only freshly mowed lawn in the neighborhood. All the other yards were being recaptured by wilderness, since everybody else had moved away. And the whole time Wojciehowitz was proposing, a big golden retriever was barking at them and pretending to be dangerous. This was Donald, the dog who had been such a comfort to Roy during the last months of his life. Even dogs had names back then. Donald was the dog. Robert was the man. And Donald was harmless. He had never bitten anybody. All he wanted was for someone to throw a stick for him, so he could bring it back, so somebody could throw a stick for him, so he could bring it back, and so on. Donald wasn\u2019t very smart, to say the least. He certainly wasn\u2019t going to write Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony. When Donald slept, he would often whimper and his hind legs would shiver. He was dreaming of chasing sticks.\nRobert was frightened of dogs\u2014because he and his mother had been attacked by a Doberman pinscher when Robert was only five years old. Robert was all right with dogs as long as there was somebody around who knew how to control them. But whenever he was alone with one, no matter what size it was, he sweated and he trembled, and his hair stood on end. So he was extremely careful to avoid such situations.\nBut his marriage proposal so surprised Mary Hepburn that she burst into tears, something nobody does anymore. She was so embarrassed and confused that she apologized to him brokenly, and she ran into the house. She didn\u2019t want to be married to anybody but Roy. Even if Roy was dead, she still didn\u2019t want to be married to anybody but Roy.\nSo that left Robert all alone on the front lawn with Donald.", 0.08059051398337114], "title": "Galapagos"},

That loft had become not only Kitchen\u2019s workplace but his home. I myself had taken to spending two or three nights a week there, as I found myself less and less beloved in the basement apartment three blocks away, where my wife and children lived.\nWhat did my wife have to complain about? I had quit my job as a salesman of life insurance for Connecticut General. I was intoxicated most of the time not only by alcohol but by the creation of huge fields of a single color of Sateen Dura-Luxe. I had rented a potato barn and made a down payment on a house out here, which was then a wilderness.\nAnd in the midst of that domestic nightmare there arrived a registered letter from Italy, a country I had never seen. It asked me to come to Florence, all expenses paid for one, to testify in a lawsuit there about two paintings, a Giotto and a Masaccio, which had been taken by American soldiers from a German general in Paris. They had been turned over to my platoon of art experts to be catalogued and shipped to a warehouse in Le Havre, where they were to be crated and stored. The general had evidently stolen them from a private house while retreating north through Florence.\nThe crating in Le Havre was done by Italian prisoners of war, who had done that sort of work in civilian life. One of them evidently found a way to ship both paintings to his wife in Rome, where he kept them hidden, except to show to close friends after the war. The rightful owners were suing to recover them.\nSo I went over there alone, and I got my name in the papers for accounting for the trip the paintings made from Paris to Le Havre.\nBut I had a secret, which I have never told anybody before: \u201cOnce an illustrator, always an illustrator!\u201d I couldn\u2019t help seeing stories in my own compositions of strips of colored tape applied to vast, featureless fields of Sateen Dura-Luxe. This idea came into my head uninvited, like a nitwit tune for a singing commercial, and would not get out again; each strip of tape was the soul at the core of some sort of person or lower animal.\nSo whenever I stuck on a piece of tape, the voice of the illustrator in me who would not die would say, for example, \u201cThe orange tape is the soul of an Arctic explorer, separated from his companions, and the white one is the soul of a charging polar bear.\u201d\nThis secret fantasy, moreover, infected and continues to infect my way of seeing scenes in real life. If I watch two people talking on a street corner, I see not only their flesh and clothes, but narrow, vertical bands of color inside them\u2014not so much like tape, actually, but more like low-intensity neon tubes.\nWhen I got back to my hotel at about noon on my last day in Florence, there was a note for me in my pigeonhole. As far as I knew, I had no friends in all of Italy. The note on expensive paper with a noble crest at the top said this:\nThere can\u2019t be all that many Rabo Karabekians in the world. If you\u2019re the wrong one, come on over anyway. I\u2019m mad for Armenians. Isn\u2019t everybody? You can rub your feet on my carpets and make sparks. Sound like fun? Down with modern art!

I spoke from the steps of the Public Library at Forty-second and Fifth. This island was by then a sleepy seaside resort. It had never recovered from that first jolt of gravity, which had stripped its buildings of their elevators, and had flooded its tunnels, and had buckled all but one bridge, which was the Brooklyn Bridge.\nNow gravity had started to turn mean again. It was no longer a jolting experience. If the Chinese were indeed in charge of it, they had learned how to increase or decrease it gradually, wishing to cut down on injuries and property damage, perhaps. It was as majestically graceful as the tides now.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen I spoke from the library steps, the gravity was heavy. So I chose to sit in a chair while speaking. I was cold sober, but I lolled in the chair like a drunken English squire from olden times.\nMy audience, which was composed mostly of retired people, actually lay down on Fifth Avenue, which the police had blocked off, but where there would have been hardly any traffic anyway. Somewhere over on Madison Avenue, perhaps, there was a small explosion. The island\u2019s useless skyscrapers were being quarried.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI spoke of American loneliness. It was the only subject I needed for victory, which was lucky. It was the only subject I had.\nIt was a shame, I said, that I had not come along earlier in American history with my simple and workable anti-loneliness plan. I said that all the damaging excesses of Americans in the past were motivated by loneliness rather than a fondness for sin.\nAn old man crawled up to me afterwards and told me how he used to buy life insurance and mutual funds and household appliances and automobiles and so on, not because he liked them or needed them, but because the salesman seemed to promise to be his relative, and so on.", -0.034297138047138055], "title": "Slapstick"}, "happy-birthday-wanda-june": {"tfidf": [["profitable", 0.31650519369474467], ["keen", 0.31650519369474467], ["earlier", 0.31650519369474467], ["taxicab", 0.31650519369474467], ["neat", 0.31650519369474467], ["policeman", 0.31650519369474467], ["delivered", 0.27799701699696994], ["evening", 0.2394888402991952], ["met", 0.22709197633729467], ["baby", 0.22709197633729467], ["emergency", 0.20839907430278282], ["hope", 0.18328878965039078], ["doctor", 0.16989089760500808], ["woodly", 0.11804049980841874], ["penelope", 0.06840990239121571], ["harold", 0.012958982304433018]], "sentiment": ["PENELOPE\nYou know each other?\nWOODLY\nWe met here earlier this evening.\nPENELOPE\nHow neat.

["And he went seamlessly from talk of such dangerous work in such a dark place to a recollection of a tea dance at the Ritz fifteen years before, where a Harvard classmate named Nils Johannsen had been caught using loaded dice in a crap game in the men\u2019s room. This was the same person who was now the president of Johannsen Grinder, who had fired all these workers. Johannsen\u2019s grandfather had started the company. He said that Johannsen had had his head stuck in a toilet bowl at the Ritz, and that the hope was that he would never use loaded dice again.\n\u201cBut here he is,\u201d said Whistler, \u201cusing loaded dice again.\u201d\nHe said that Harvard could be held responsible for many atrocities, including the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti, but that it was innocent of having produced Nils Johannsen. \u201cHe never attended a lecture, never wrote a paper, never read a book while he was there,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was asked to leave at the end of his sophomore year.\n\u201cOh, I pity him,\u201d he said. \u201cI even understand him. How else could he ever amount to anything if he did not use loaded dice? How has he used loaded dice with you? The laws that say he can fire anybody who stands up for the basic rights of workers\u2014those are loaded dice. The policemen who will protect his property rights but not your human rights\u2014those are loaded dice.\u201d\nWhistler asked the fired workers how much Johannsen actually knew or cared about grinding wheels. How shrewd this was! The way to befriend working people in those days, and to get them to criticize their society as brilliantly as any philosopher, was to get them to talk about the one subject on which they were almost arrogantly well-informed: their work.\nIt was something to hear. Worker after worker testified that Johannsen\u2019s father and grandfather had been mean bastards, too, but that they at least knew how to run a factory. Raw materials of the highest quality arrived on time in their day\u2014machinery was properly maintained, the heating plant and the toilets worked, bad workmanship was punished and good workmanship was rewarded, no defective grinding wheel ever reached a customer, and on and on.\nWhistler asked them if one of their own number could run the factory better than Nils Johannsen did. One man spoke for them all on that subject: \u201cGod, yes,\u201d he said, \u201canyone here.\u201d\nWhistler asked him if he thought it was right that a person could inherit a factory.\nThe man\u2019s considered answer was this: \u201cNot if he\u2019s afraid of the factory and everybody in it\u2014no. No, siree.\u201d\nThis piece of groping wisdom impresses me still. A sensible prayer people could offer up from time to time, it seems to me, might go something like this: \u201cDear Lord\u2014never put me in the charge of a frightened human being.\u201d", -0.0023942455394068357], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["reproduced", 0.1025289991770101], ["corporals", 0.1025289991770101], ["poster", 0.1025289991770101], ["fifty", 0.07353011787189116], ["worth", 0.06506158401160765], ["picture", 0.05373530185985315], ["excluded", 0.05126449958850505], ["local", 0.05126449958850505], ["fingerprints", 0.05126449958850505], ["inspection", 0.05126449958850505], ["uninhabitable", 0.05126449958850505], ["dense", 0.05126449958850505], ["shares", 0.05126449958850505], ["identification", 0.05126449958850505], ["higgledy", 0.05126449958850505], ["convert", 0.05126449958850505], ["hunters", 0.05126449958850505], ["featured", 0.05126449958850505], ["total", 0.05126449958850505], ["piggledy", 0.05126449958850505], ["clever", 0.05126449958850505], ["share", 0.05126449958850505], ["practicing", 0.05126449958850505], ["handwriting", 0.05126449958850505], ["cents", 0.05126449958850505], ["currency", 0.05126449958850505], ["inhabitants", 0.05126449958850505], ["income", 0.05126449958850505], ["intended", 0.05126449958850505], ["phase", 0.05126449958850505], ["reorganization", 0.05126449958850505], ["required", 0.05126449958850505], ["adult", 0.05126449958850505], ["idealistic", 0.0450199303942713], ["1929", 0.0450199303942713], ["china", 0.0450199303942713], ["61", 0.0450199303942713], ["submit", 0.0450199303942713], ["population", 0.0450199303942713], ["scrawny", 0.0450199303942713], ["customs", 0.0450199303942713], ["amused", 0.0450199303942713], ["reward", 0.0450199303942713], ["lorenzo", 0.042249326196728894], ["slapped", 0.04136709158248605], ["signs", 0.04136709158248605], ["closer", 0.04136709158248605], ["announced", 0.04136709158248605], ["luggage", 0.04136709158248605], ["10", 0.04136709158248605], ["india", 0.04136709158248605], ["fill", 0.04136709158248605], ["000", 0.04136709158248605], ["insisted", 0.04136709158248605], ["spend", 0.04136709158248605], ["monzano", 0.04008330723467268], ["san", 0.039358187830454076], ["bottom", 0.03877536120003757], ["equal", 0.03877536120003757], ["smoking", 0.03877536120003757], ["neat", 0.03877536120003757], ["divided", 0.03877536120003757], ["bokonon", 0.038207927981297435], ["mile", 0.03676505893594558], ["square", 0.03676505893594558], ["colored", 0.03676505893594558], ["police", 0.0351225223882523], ["cigar", 0.0351225223882523], ["dollars", 0.033733777524943664], ["airport", 0.033733777524943664], ["time", 0.03277762961110215], ["alive", 0.032530792005803826], ["walls", 0.03146968357646703], ["persons", 0.03146968357646703], ["plenty", 0.03146968357646703], ["bokononism", 0.030520489741711843], ["corporal", 0.030520489741711843], ["caught", 0.030520489741711843], ["form", 0.029661839473204412], ["money", 0.02887795319401856], ["johnson", 0.02887795319401856], ["country", 0.02628622281157008], ["kind", 0.025740055047458056], ["sort", 0.024738022298717296], ["hook", 0.0242759205474781], ["die", 0.0242759205474781], ["wrote", 0.0242759205474781], ["philip", 0.02341727027897067], ["mccabe", 0.02226561828338612], ["american", 0.02157227557044803], ["wanted", 0.020928501120158437], ["dead", 0.020623081735692838], ["will", 0.016970242923907572], ["looked", 0.016203055461382284], ["papa", 0.014683931925924695], ["castle", 0.0137970844231026], ["man", 0.0098670234611664]], "sentiment": ["At the same time, it had as dense a population as could be found anywhere, India and China not excluded.

I haven\u2019t reported the very bad thing Selma\u2019s done, and that makes me an accessory.\u201d\nSelma paled.\n\u201cSelma,\u201d said Helmholtz, \u201cwhat made you think that one particular number on the file cards was an I.Q.?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I read up on I.Q.s in the library,\u201d said Selma, \u201cand then I looked myself up in the files, and I found the number on my card that was probably my I.Q.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d said Helmholtz, \u201cand a tribute to your modesty. That number you thought was your I.Q., Selma\u2014that was your weight. And when you looked up the rest of us here, all you found out was who was heavy and who was light. In my case, you discovered that I was once a very fat boy. Big Floyd and I are far from being geniuses, and small Schroeder here is far from being a moron.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Selma.\nBig Floyd gave a sigh that sounded like a freight whistle. \u201cI told you I was dumb,\u201d he said to Selma wretchedly. \u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t any genius.\u201d He pointed helplessly at Schroeder. \u201cHe\u2019s the genius. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s got it. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s got the brains to carry him right up into the stars or somewhere! I told you that!\u201d\nBig Floyd pressed the heels of his hands against his temples, as though to jar his brains into working better. \u201cBoy,\u201d he said tragically, \u201cI sure proved how dumb I was, believing for even one minute I had something on the ball.\u201d", -0.0006216931216931219], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["trickle", 0.0838766027987004], ["elders",

Usually when people talk about the trickle-down theory, it has to do with economics. The richer people at the top of a society become, supposedly, the more wealth there is to trickle down to the people below. It never really works out that way, of course, because if there are 2 things people at the top can\u2019t stand, they have to be leakage and overflow.\nBut the Elders\u2019 scheme of having the misery of higher animals trickle down to microorganisms worked like a dream.\nTHERE WAS A lot more to the story than that. The author taught me a new term, which was \u201cFinale Rack.\u201d This was apparently from the vocabulary of pyrotechnicians, specialists in loud and bright but otherwise harmless nighttime explosions for climaxes of patriotic holidays. A Finale Rack was a piece of milled lumber maybe 3 meters long and 20 centimeters wide and 5 centimeters thick, with all sorts of mortars and rocket launchers nailed to it, linked in series by a single fuse.\nWhen it seemed that a fireworks show was over, that was when the Master Pyrotechnician lit the fuse of the Finale Rack.\nThat is how the author characterized World War II and the few years that followed it. He called it \u201cthe Finale Rack of so-called Human Progress.\u201d\nIF THE AUTHOR was right that the whole point of life on Earth was to make germs shape up so that they would be ready to ship out when the time came, then even the greatest human being in history, Shakespeare or Mozart or Lincoln or Voltaire or whoever, was nothing more than a Petri dish in the truly Grand Scheme of Things.\nIn the story, the Elders of Tralfamadore were indifferent, to say the least, to all the suffering going on. When 6,000 rebellious slaves were crucified on either side of the Appian Way back in good old 71 B.C., the Elders would have been delighted if a crucified person had spit into the face of a Centurion, giving him pneumonia or TB.\nIF I HAD to guess when \u201cThe Protocols of the Elders of Tralfamadore\u201d was written, I would have to say, \u201cA long, long time ago, after World War II but before the Korean War, which broke out in 1950, when I was 10.\u201d There was no mention of Korea as part of the Finale Rack. There was a lot of talk about making the planet a paradise by killing all the bugs and germs, and generating electricity with atomic energy so cheaply that it wouldn\u2019t even be metered, and making it possible for everybody to have an automobile that would make him or her mightier than 200 horses and 3 times faster than a cheetah, and incinerating the other half of the planet in case the people there got the idea that it was their sort of intelligence that was supposed to be exported to the rest of the Universe.\nThe story was very likely pirated from some other publication, so the omission of the author\u2019s name may have been intentional. What sort of writer, after all, would submit a work of fiction for possible publication in Black Garterbelt?\nI DID NOT realize at the time how much that story affected me.

"sentiment": ["Pine couldn\u2019t have chosen another instant in history when his announcement would have set off a more explosive response. Consider the times: the world, as though by some malevolent magic, had been divided into hostile halves, and had begun a series of moves and countermoves that could only, it seemed, end in disaster. Nobody knew what to do. The fate of humanity seemed out of the control of human beings. Every day was filled with desperate helplessness, and with worse news than that of the day before.\nThen, from Verdigris, Oklahoma, came the announcement that the trouble with the world was that the Devil was at large. And with the announcement came an offer of proof and a suggested solution!\nThe sigh of relief that went up from the earth must have been heard in other galaxies. The trouble with the world wasn\u2019t the Russians or the Americans or the Chinese or the British or the scientists or the generals or the financiers or the politicians, or, praise be to God, human beings anywhere, poor things. People were all right, and decent and innocent and smart, and it was the Devil who was making their good-hearted enterprises go sour. Every human being\u2019s self-respect increased a thousand-fold, and no one, save the Devil, lost face.\nPoliticians of all lands rushed to the microphones to declare themselves as being against the Devil. Editorial pages everywhere took the same fearless stand\u2014against the Devil. Nobody was for him.\nIn the United Nations, the small nations introduced a resolution to the effect that the big nations all join hands, like the affectionate children they really were at heart, and chase their only enemy, the Devil, away from earth forever.\nFor many months following Pine\u2019s announcement, it was almost necessary to boil a grandmother or run berserk with a battle-axe in an orphanage to qualify for space on the front page of a newspaper. All the news was about Armageddon. Men who had entertained their readers with whimsical accounts of the Verdigris activities became, overnight, sober specialists in such matters as Bratpuhrian Devil-gongs, the efficacy of crosses on bootsoles, the Black Mass, and allied lore. The mails were jammed as badly as at Christmastime with letters to the U.N., Government officials, and the Pine Institute. Almost everybody, apparently, had known all along that the Devil was the trouble with everything. Many said they\u2019d seen him, and almost all of them had pretty good ideas for getting rid of him.\nThose who thought the whole thing was crazy found themselves in the position of a burial insurance salesman at a birthday party, and most of them shrugged and kept their mouths shut. Those who didn\u2019t keep their mouths shut weren\u2019t noticed anyway.\nAmong the doubters was Dr. Gorman Tarbell. \u201cGood heavens,\u201d he said ruefully, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve proved in the experiments. They were just a beginning. It\u2019s years too soon to say whether we were doing a job on the Devil or what. Now Pine\u2019s got everybody all whooped up to thinking all we have to do is turn on a couple of gadgets or something, and earth\u2019ll be Eden again.\u201d Nobody listened.\nPine, who was bankrupt anyway, turned over the Institute to the U.N., and UNDICO, the United Nations Demonological Investigating Commitee, was formed. Dr. Tarbell and I were named as American delegates to the Committee, which held its first meeting in Verdigris. I was elected Chairman, and, as you might expect, I was subjected to a lot of poor jokes about my being the perfect man for the job because of my name.\nIt was very depressing for the Committee to have so much expected\u2014demanded, even\u2014of them, and to have so little knowledge with which to work. Our mandate from the people of the world wasn\u2019t to prevent mental illness, but to eliminate the Devil. Bit by bit, however, and under terrific pressure, we mapped a plan, drawn up, for the most part, by Dr. Tarbell.", 0.01682467532467533], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
