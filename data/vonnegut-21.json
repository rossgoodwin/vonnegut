has treated your youngest like a prince. God bless him for that. I own a home now. Albeit humble, it\u2019s ours, and we\u2019ll love it I\u2019m sure. And it\u2019s not so humble as the $7000 I\u2019m paying for it. I\u2019m selling 2\u00bd% bonds to get the money. I want no debt. This is the cheapest way for me to finance our home, and no recession can take it from us. It\u2019s a good little house, well built, and pleasant to see. Please come soon to examine it at your leisure.\nOur furniture is in Bernard\u2019s barn, and moving it by his trailer will give us one helluvan appetite and double hernias this next week-end. Our new G.E. refrigerator came today. Our stove should be here in a week or so. Bernard and I are examining automatic washers with more than casual interest. The Bendix will probably do more to lower the maternal death rate than did twilight sleep. If an automatic washer were to displace the commercial laundry and diaper service, Jane and I would have the gadget paid for in less than a year [\u2026]\nI have received a cordial letter from the Anthropology Department at Chicago, saying that I may take my Master\u2019s finals at whatever Eastern university I choose. I shall probably have the examinations, ten hours of them, proctored by Bernard\u2019s tenant, Bob Finholt of Union. That will be in December, I think. The thesis is another matter. It will take a while longer. I\u2019m hoping to be sent to New York on business so I can do work in the Columbia Library.\nPerhaps you saw the news accounts that mentioned Bernard as being aboard the hurricane-busting B-17. This was a newsman\u2019s mistake. Bernard got into the farewell picture but not into the plane.\nI left the Middle West for Schenectady because the General Electric Company offered me a more congenial, better paying job than did anyone else. And, as Allie and Jim were quick to perceive, people like us cannot afford to live in Indianapolis. Maybe we\u2019ll come back some day\u2014but not now. I think we\u2019ll do a more honest job of living away from what will always be home.\nI like my job. I\u2019m not sorry that I took it, for it\u2019s better than I expected. It has an agreeable dignity to it, and demands of me a certain craftsmanship in which I can take pride. That, you\u2019ll agree, is important. Moreover, I\u2019m earning, for the first time, enough to support my wife and child. And I\u2019ll have the will and time and energy to write what I please when my work is done.\u2026\nNovember 28, 1947\nSchenectady, NY\nTO ALEX VONNEGUT", 0.20531076066790352], "title": "Letters"},

anybody\u2019s whim of killing Father or Fats or Abraham Lincoln or John Lennon or Martin Luther King, Jr., or a woman pushing a baby carriage, should be proof enough for anybody that, to quote the old science fiction writer Kilgore Trout, \u201cbeing alive is a crock of shit.\u201d\n2\nImagine this: A great American university gives up football in the name of sanity. It turns its vacant stadium into a bomb factory. So much for sanity. Shades of Kilgore Trout.\nI am speaking of my alma mater, the University of Chicago. In December of 1942, long before I got there, the first chain reaction of uranium on Earth was compelled by scientists underneath the stands of Stagg Field. Their intent was to demonstrate the feasibility of an atomic bomb. We were at war with Germany and Japan.\nFifty-three years later, on August 6th, 1995, there was a gathering in the chapel of my university to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the detonation of the first atomic bomb, over the city of Hiroshima, Japan. I was there.\nOne of the speakers was the physicist Leo Seren. He had participated in the successful experiment under the lifeless sports facility so long ago. Get this: He apologized for having done that!\nSomebody should have told him that being a physicist, on a planet where the smartest animals hate being alive so much, means never having to say you\u2019re sorry.\nNow imagine this: A man creates a hydrogen bomb for a paranoid Soviet Union, makes sure it will work, and then wins a Nobel Peace Prize! This real-life character, worthy of a story by Kilgore Trout, was the late physicist Andrei Sakharov.\nHe won his Nobel in 1975 for demanding a halt to the testing of nuclear weapons. He, of course, had already tested his. His wife was a pediatrician! What sort of person could perfect a hydrogen bomb while married to a child-care specialist? What sort of physician would stay with a mate that cracked?\n\u201cAnything interesting happen at work today, Honey-bunch?\u201d", 0.18050595238095243], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["harry", 0.13622896916681065], ["crawford", 0.08508386526327995], ["town", 0.07928691780538487], ["play", 0.0789041204710539], ["character", 0.06893978660050869], ["psychiatrist", 0.06893978660050869], ["north", 0.06597363636273121], ["director", 0.0635335851590665], ["miller", 0.05969782419304276], ["plays", 0.05969782419304276], ["tryouts", 0.05672257684218663], ["nash", 0.05672257684218663], ["stella", 0.052236280353903784], ["stage", 0.04620981203732969], ["upstairs", 0.04504966034413463], ["told", 0.040528686766517684], ["participate", 0.039090874503987315], ["appointed", 0.039090874503987315], ["colorful", 0.039090874503987315], ["doorstep", 0.039090874503987315], ["unitarian", 0.039090874503987315], ["clerking", 0.039090874503987315], ["junior", 0.039090874503987315], ["senior", 0.039090874503987315], ["wanted", 0.03903216340339902], ["consolidated", 0.034469893300254344], ["benefit", 0.034469893300254344], ["directs", 0.034469893300254344], ["warmed", 0.034469893300254344], ["gymnasium", 0.034469893300254344], ["community", 0.034469893300254344], ["maroon", 0.034469893300254344], ["sawyer", 0.034469893300254344], ["held", 0.03375235553897191], ["enjoying", 0.03176679257953325], ["script", 0.03176679257953325], ["fed", 0.02984891209652138], ["parts", 0.02984891209652138], ["library", 0.027145811375800282], ["curtain", 0.027145811375800282], ["hardware", 0.027145811375800282], ["brando", 0.027145811375800282], ["curiosity", 0.027145811375800282], ["marlon", 0.027145811375800282], ["shaw", 0.026118140176951892], ["faster", 0.026118140176951892], ["doris", 0.02522793089278841], ["sad", 0.02522793089278841], ["experience", 0.024442710655079185], ["stranger", 0.023740307217360344], ["soul", 0.023740307217360344], ["parents", 0.023104906018664845], ["weeks", 0.023104906018664845], ["surprise", 0.023104906018664845], ["store", 0.023104906018664845], ["surprised", 0.023104906018664845], ["asked", 0.022939952656087528], ["church", 0.022524830172067314], ["public", 0.022524830172067314], ["state", 0.021991212120910406], ["club", 0.021991212120910406], ["forever", 0.021991212120910406], ["wife", 0.021726995613344506], ["hold", 0.021497158973218924], ["meeting", 0.021497158973218924], ["helene", 0.02103720649663925], ["week", 0.02103720649663925], ["waited", 0.02103720649663925], ["fact", 0.02103720649663925], ["time", 0.020866992199861205], ["trouble", 0.02060694968905544], ["second", 0.019461281309544377], ["hope", 0.01879405825249783], ["job", 0.01879405825249783], ["baby", 0.01879405825249783], ["blue", 0.018483924814931874], ["exactly", 0.018483924814931874], ["body", 0.018187579731126318], ["stay", 0.018187579731126318], ["dollars", 0.017631702338199308], ["married", 0.017370230917177435], ["happy", 0.017118628730625123], ["fifty", 0.016876177769485953], ["people", 0.01677947986146674], ["pretty", 0.01619762647408634], ["real", 0.01619762647408634], ["em", 0.01619762647408634], ["high", 0.01619762647408634], ["going", 0.015388012990476839], ["school", 0.015200748247613246], ["nice", 0.015200748247613246], ["kind", 0.01484030010581141], ["floor", 0.01484030010581141], ["lot", 0.014667130196456338], ["sat", 0.014667130196456338], ["woman", 0.01417307704876486], ["sir", 0.01417307704876486], ["better", 0.012375319935770842], ["called", 0.012375319935770842], ["years", 0.011685048742831905], ["find", 0.011261626038016401], ["life", 0.011261626038016401], ["left", 0.011059590374714207], ["turned", 0.010673008657045213], ["wasn", 0.01048781156299804], ["head", 0.010307620413745245], ["room", 0.010219318902078441], ["eyes", 0.009794546806171056], ["thing", 0.009092143368452214], ["looked", 0.008128268509711498], ["good", 0.007343048272002274]], "sentiment": ["\"I stay in each town eight weeks, sir,\" she said. She had pretty blue eyes, but there sure wasn\u2019t much hope or curiosity in them. She told me she had been going from town to town like that for two years, always a stranger.\nAnd I got it in my head that she might make a good Stella for the play. Stella was the wife of the Marlon Brando character, the wife of the character I wanted Harry Nash to play. So I told her where and when we were going to hold tryouts, and said the club would be very happy if she\u2019d come.\nShe looked surprised, and she warmed up a little. \"You know,\" she said, \"that\u2019s the first time anybody ever asked me to participate in any community thing.\"\n\"Well,\" I said, \"there isn\u2019t any other way to get to know a lot of nice people faster than to be in a play with \u2019em.\"\nShe said her name was Helene Shaw. She said she might just surprise me\u2014and herself. She said she just might come.\nYou would think that North Crawford would be fed up with Harry Nash in plays after all the plays he\u2019d been in. But the fact was that North Crawford probably could have gone on enjoying Harry forever, because he was never Harry on stage. When the maroon curtain went up on the stage in the gymnasium of the Consolidated Junior-Senior High School, Harry, body and soul, was exactly what the script and the director told him to be.\nSomebody said one time that Harry ought to go to a psychiatrist so he could be something important and colorful in real life, too\u2014so he could get married anyway, and maybe get a better job than just clerking in Miller\u2019s Hardware Store for fifty dollars a week. But I don\u2019t know what a psychiatrist could have turned up about him that the town didn\u2019t already know. The trouble with Harry was he\u2019d been left on the doorstep of the Unitarian Church when he was a baby, and he never did find out who his parents were.\nWhen I told him there in Miller\u2019s that I\u2019d been appointed director, that I wanted him in my play, he said what he always said to anybody who asked him to be in a play\u2014and it was kind of sad, if you think about it.\n\"Who am I this time?\" he said.\nSo I held the tryouts where they\u2019re always held\u2014in the meeting room on the second floor of the North Crawford Public Library. Doris Sawyer, the woman who usually directs, came to give me the benefit of all her experience. The two of us sat in state upstairs, while the people who wanted parts waited below.

The man who crushed his foot went on to become a hero in the trenches in the First World War, and Father would have liked to have fought beside him\u2014and, like Fortune, come home with medals on his chest. The only remotely military honor Father would ever receive was a citation from the governor of Ohio for Father\u2019s leadership of scrap drives in Midland County during World War Two. There was no ceremony. The certificate simply arrived in the mail one day.\nFather was in prison over at Shepherdstown when it came. Mother and I brought it to him on visitors\u2019 day. I was thirteen then. It would have been kinder of us to burn it up and scatter its ashes over Sugar Creek. That certificate was the crowning irony, as far as Father was concerned.\n\u201cAt last I have joined the company of the immortals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are only two more honors for me to covet now.\u201d One was to be a licensed dog. The other was to be a notary public.\nAnd Father made us hand over the certificate so that he could wipe his behind with it at the earliest opportunity, which he surely did.\nInstead of saying good-bye that day, he said this, a finger in the air: \u201cNature calls.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd somewhere in there, in the autumn of 1916, to be exact, the old rascal August Gunther died under most mysterious circumstances. He got up two hours before dawn one day, and prepared and ate a hearty breakfast while his wife and daughter slept. And he set out on foot, armed with a double-barreled ten-gauge shotgun which my father had given to him, meaning to join Father and John Fortune and some other young bucks in gun pits on the edge of a meadow on John Fortune\u2019s father\u2019s dairy farm. They were going to shoot geese which had spent the night on the backwaters of Sugar Creek and on Crystal Lake. The meadow had been baited with cracked corn.\nHe never reached the gun pits, or so the story went. So he must have died somewhere in the intervening five miles, which included the Sugar Creek Bridge. One month later, his headless body was found at the mouth of Sugar Creek just west of Cincinnati, about to start its voyage to the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico and beyond.\nWhat a vacation from Midland City!\nAnd when I was little, the decapitation of August Gunther so long ago, sixteen years before my birth, was the most legendary of all the unsolved crimes committed in my hometown. And I had a ghoulish ambition. I imagined that I would be famous and admired, if only I could find August Gunther\u2019s missing head. And after that the murderer would have to confess, for some reason, and he would be taken off to be punished, and so on\u2014and the mayor would pin a medal on me.", 0.12422619047619046], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "god-bless-you-dr-kevorkian": {"tfidf": [["thousands", 0.061473519585310984], ["baseball", 0.061473519585310984], ["philip", 0.061473519585310984], ["strax", 0.061473519585310984], ["poet", 0.061473519585310984], ["dimaggio", 0.061473519585310984], ["author", 0.0353170222056904], ["women", 0.031106766520516634], ["fond", 0.030736759792655492], ["devoted", 0.030736759792655492], ["feminist", 0.030736759792655492], ["radiologist", 0.030736759792655492], ["detected", 0.030736759792655492], ["batted", 0.030736759792655492], ["womanly", 0.030736759792655492], ["song", 0.030736759792655492], ["breast", 0.030736759792655492], ["runs", 0.030736759792655492], ["success", 0.030736759792655492], ["remind", 0.030736759792655492], ["soft", 0.030736759792655492], ["unabashedly", 0.030736759792655492], ["crowd", 0.030736759792655492], ["feathers", 0.030736759792655492], ["detection", 0.030736759792655492], ["terms", 0.030736759792655492], ["folk", 0.030736759792655492], ["detect", 0.030736759792655492], ["apparatus", 0.030736759792655492], ["turning", 0.030736759792655492], ["weak", 0.030736759792655492], ["joe", 0.030736759792655492], ["recited", 0.030736759792655492], ["autographed", 0.030736759792655492], ["refined", 0.030736759792655492], ["malignancies", 0.030736759792655492], ["gertrude", 0.030736759792655492], ["types", 0.030736759792655492], ["frenzied", 0.030736759792655492], ["charming", 0.030736759792655492], ["physician", 0.030736759792655492], ["extraordinarily", 0.030736759792655492], ["cancers", 0.030736759792655492], ["rust", 0.030736759792655492], ["indicated", 0.030736759792655492], ["lust", 0.030736759792655492], ["tissue", 0.030736759792655492], ["couplet", 0.030736759792655492], ["bones", 0.030736759792655492], ["deed", 0.030736759792655492], ["rays", 0.030736759792655492], ["tis", 0.030736759792655492], ["composition", 0.030736759792655492], ["poor", 0.030736759792655492], ["breasts", 0.030736759792655492], ["mammograms", 0.030736759792655492], ["moment", 0.030736759792655492], ["lines", 0.030736759792655492], ["fighting", 0.030736759792655492], ["edge", 0.030736759792655492], ["professional", 0.030736759792655492], ["men", 0.02766673714704579], ["point", 0.024197635447750346], ["day", 0.024197635447750346], ["early", 0.024197635447750346], ["cancer", 0.024197635447750346], ["number", 0.024197635447750346], ["better", 0.024197635447750346], ["strong", 0.024197635447750346], ["angels", 0.024197635447750346], ["player", 0.024197635447750346], ["glowing", 0.024197635447750346], ["extended", 0.024197635447750346], ["disease", 0.024197635447750346], ["volumes", 0.024197635447750346], ["beloved", 0.020372492918428037], ["killed", 0.020372492918428037], ["career", 0.020372492918428037], ["poetry", 0.020372492918428037], ["age", 0.018028517830706345], ["three", 0.0176585111028452], ["lives", 0.0176585111028452], ["obituary", 0.0176585111028452], ["thirty", 0.015553383260258317], ["love", 0.015553383260258317], ["called", 0.015553383260258317], ["wife", 0.015553383260258317], ["newyork", 0.013833368573522895], ["wanted", 0.013833368573522895], ["interviewed", 0.012379116877039327], ["life", 0.009014258915353172], ["died", 0.009014258915353172], ["late", 0.008115106275689732], ["dr", 0.008115106275689732], ["times", 0.006539124344905144], ["death", 0.0045802624130349134]], "sentiment": ["having interviewed the poet Dr. Philip Strax, S-T-R-A-X.

He was met in the corridor by Hope, who was massaging her right arm, and by Mr. Banghart, whose knife was sheathed and tucked beneath his belt.\n\u201cWhat on earth got into you, all of a sudden?\u201d asked Mr. Banghart solicitously.\n\u201cI tripped and fell in the dark,\u201d said Haley quickly. He turned to Hope and prayed that his lie would make him whole again in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hope. I didn\u2019t mean to fall against you.\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be helped, I guess. Don\u2019t worry about it\u2014just a bruise.\u201d\nHaley sighed gratefully. They descended the ladder and walked from the barn together. Mr. Banghart struck out for his own house, and Haley and Hope mounted the back steps to the kitchen. Just before she pushed open the screen door, Hope turned to Haley, who was congratulating himself on having talked his way out of a perfectly desolate situation.\n\u201cIf you flop as a piano player, you can always make a good living as a bodyguard,\u201d she said.\nIV.\n\u201cNow take the case of the 240 howitzer,\u201d said the General. \u201cFar more effective against concrete bunkers than aerial bombardment. I remember just before the Bulge, the glamour boys dropped everything they had on a Jerry pillbox, and they didn\u2019t even chip it. So I called back to First Army Headquarters. \u2018Send up some 240s,\u2019 I said. Well, sir, . . .\u201d\nHaley nodded and turned his face toward the sunroom windows to hide his yawn from the General. Nothing moved in his line of sight save Mr. Banghart, who bobbed in the distance on the springing seat of a moving machine, circling again and again a shrinking island of standing alfalfa. It was Saturday afternoon\u2014an afternoon, as the bulletin board decreed, for \u201crecreation and cleanup.\u201d Haley had tuned in a concert broadcast on the sunroom\u2019s small radio, but when the General had started to shout war stories above the music, Annie had turned it off. From overhead came a muffled scuffing as Kitty and Hope moved about their rooms, tidying them up. Annie sat in a rocker near Haley, attentive to the General\u2019s words and seemingly very entertained.\nHaley wondered if he should tell the General about Mr. Banghart\u2019s knife. Hope had made him promise not to say anything about it. She had laughed the matter off and repeated what he had heard from others on the farm, that Mr. Banghart was no more dangerous than the mice in the corncrib. Still and all, he reflected, the combination of jangled brains and an eight-inch bowie knife would be reassuring to very few persons. But the last thing he wanted to do was to go against Hope\u2019s judgment. . . .", 0.1176305683563748], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["roy", 0.0794074539381774], ["stars", 0.05866153009653345], ["nose", 0.04846818920594602], ["held", 0.04250546702788477], ["daughter", 0.04250546702788477], ["front", 0.04212226113715674], ["sun", 0.03827484831535859], ["moon", 0.03499332550191432], ["wanted", 0.03499332550191432], ["motorcycle", 0.032312126137297344], ["won", 0.03004520437513178], ["winced", 0.029330765048266726], ["mister", 0.029330765048266726], ["sped", 0.029330765048266726], ["propelled", 0.029330765048266726], ["drinking", 0.029330765048266726], ["considerate", 0.029330765048266726], ["effluvium", 0.029330765048266726], ["jump", 0.029330765048266726], ["psychology", 0.029330765048266726], ["gentleman", 0.029330765048266726], ["gears", 0.029330765048266726], ["patient", 0.029330765048266726], ["withering", 0.029330765048266726], ["handful", 0.029330765048266726], ["ponderous", 0.029330765048266726], ["faced", 0.029330765048266726], ["sniff", 0.029330765048266726], ["universe", 0.029330765048266726], ["abuse", 0.029330765048266726], ["experimental", 0.029330765048266726], ["hotly", 0.029330765048266726], ["clashing", 0.029330765048266726], ["smells", 0.029330765048266726], ["offer", 0.029330765048266726], ["releasing", 0.029330765048266726], ["wake", 0.029330765048266726], ["whisky", 0.029330765048266726], ["tank", 0.029330765048266726], ["bother", 0.029330765048266726], ["insulted", 0.029330765048266726], ["expect", 0.029330765048266726], ["shame", 0.029330765048266726], ["movements", 0.029330765048266726], ["ruts", 0.029330765048266726], ["septic", 0.029330765048266726], ["porch", 0.029330765048266726], ["trouser", 0.029330765048266726], ["flourish", 0.029330765048266726], ["collar", 0.029330765048266726], ["imprecise", 0.029330765048266726], ["focus", 0.02423409460297301], ["cut", 0.02423409460297301], ["placid", 0.02423409460297301], ["hoarsely", 0.02423409460297301], ["nope", 0.02423409460297301], ["snapped", 0.02423409460297301], ["ahead", 0.02423409460297301], ["king", 0.02423409460297301], ["brilliant", 0.02423409460297301], ["squinted", 0.02423409460297301], ["confused", 0.02423409460297301], ["grasped", 0.02423409460297301], ["slammed", 0.02423409460297301], ["bring", 0.02423409460297301], ["effective", 0.02423409460297301], ["fingers", 0.021252733513942385], ["roar", 0.021252733513942385], ["expression", 0.021252733513942385], ["murmured", 0.021252733513942385], ["angry", 0.021252733513942385], ["soul", 0.021252733513942385], ["fury", 0.021252733513942385], ["forget", 0.019137424157679293], ["marry", 0.019137424157679293], ["driveway", 0.019137424157679293], ["stand", 0.019137424157679293], ["breath", 0.019137424157679293], ["work", 0.01883726243326565], ["couldn", 0.01749666275095716], ["explained", 0.01749666275095716], ["mine", 0.01749666275095716], ["marched", 0.01749666275095716], ["short", 0.01749666275095716], ["shout", 0.016156063068648672], ["seat", 0.016156063068648672], ["white", 0.016156063068648672], ["case", 0.016156063068648672], ["heart", 0.016156063068648672], ["care", 0.01502260218756589], ["making", 0.01502260218756589], ["flemming", 0.01502260218756589], ["door", 0.014606643720739462], ["family", 0.014040753712385577], ["arose", 0.014040753712385577], ["bad", 0.01317470197961805], ["love", 0.01317470197961805], ["brought", 0.01317470197961805], ["matter", 0.012399992305663448], ["kitty", 0.010748345713864594], ["small", 0.010470843302226014], ["good", 0.01019334089058743], ["sunroom", 0.008944083267091861], ["hand", 0.008078031534324336], ["face", 0.008078031534324336], ["general", 0.0067029984115424485], ["heard", 0.006602511714749695], ["turned", 0.006602511714749695], ["haley", 0.0005550048232771633]], "sentiment": ["Kitty turned white with fury. \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant, and he\u2019s good looking, and he\u2019s a gentleman, and he\u2019s considerate, and he\u2019s from a good family, and he\u2019s\u2014\u201d\nThe roar of a motorcycle in the driveway cut her short.

["Billy was born in 1922 in Ilium, New York, the only child of a barber there. He was a funny-looking child who became a funny-looking youth\u2014tall and weak, and shaped like a bottle of Coca-Cola. He graduated from Ilium High School in the upper third of his class, and attended night sessions at the Ilium School of Optometry for one semester before being drafted for military service in the Second World War. His father died in a hunting accident during the war. So it goes.\nBilly saw service with the infantry in Europe, and was taken prisoner by the Germans. After his honorable discharge from the Army in 1945, Billy again enrolled in the Ilium School of Optometry. During his senior year there, he became engaged to the daughter of the founder and owner of the school, and then suffered a mild nervous collapse.\nHe was treated in a veteran\u2019s hospital near Lake Placid, and was given shock treatments and released. He married his fianc\u00e9e, finished his education, and was set up in business in Ilium by his father-in-law. Ilium is a particularly good city for optometrists because the General Forge and Foundry Company is there. Every employee is required to own a pair of safety glasses, and to wear them in areas where manufacturing is going on. GF&F has sixty-eight thousand employees in Ilium. That calls for a lot of lenses and a lot of frames.\nFrames are where the money is.\nBilly became rich. He had two children, Barbara and Robert. In time, his daughter Barbara married another optometrist, and Billy set him up in business. Billy\u2019s son Robert had a lot of trouble in high school, but then he joined the famous Green Berets. He straightened out, became a fine young man, and he fought in Vietnam.\nEarly in 1968, a group of optometrists, with Billy among them, chartered an airplane to fly them from Ilium to an international convention of optometrists in Montreal. The plane crashed on top of Sugarbush Mountain, in Vermont. Everybody was killed but Billy. So it goes.\nWhile Billy was recuperating in a hospital in Vermont, his wife died accidentally of carbon-monoxide poisoning. So it goes.\nWhen Billy finally got home to Ilium after the airplane crash, he was quiet for a while. He had a terrible scar across the top of his skull. He didn\u2019t resume practice. He had a housekeeper. His daughter came over almost every day.\nAnd then, without any warning, Billy went to New York City, and got on an all-night radio program devoted to talk. He told about having come unstuck in time. He said, too, that he had been kidnapped by a flying saucer in 1967. The saucer was from the planet Tralfamadore, he said. He was taken to Tralfamadore, where he was displayed naked in a zoo, he said. He was mated there with a former Earthling movie star named Montana Wildhack.\nSome night owls in Ilium heard Billy on the radio, and one of them called Billy\u2019s daughter Barbara. Barbara was upset. She and her husband went down to New York and brought Billy home. Billy insisted mildly that everything he had said on the radio was true. He said he had been kidnapped by the Tralfamadorians on the night of his daughter\u2019s wedding. He hadn\u2019t been missed, he said, because the Tralfamadorians had taken him through a time warp, so that he could be on Tralfamadore for years, and still be away from Earth for only a

one nation could seem more glorious than another by hurling some heavy object into nothingness. Galactic Spacecraft, a corporation controlled by Malachi Constant, had, as a matter of fact, received the very last order for such a showpiece, a rocket three hundred feet high and thirty-six feet in diameter. It had actually been built, but the fire order had never come.\nThe ship was called simply The Whale, and was fitted with living quarters for five passengers.\nWhat had brought everything to such an abrupt halt was the discovery of the chrono-synclastic infundibula. They had been discovered mathematically, on the basis of bizarre flight patterns of unmanned ships sent out, supposedly, in advance of men.\nThe discovery of the chrono-synclastic infundibula said to mankind in effect: \"What makes you think you\u2019re going anywhere?\"\nIt was a situation made to order for American fundamentalist preachers. They were quicker than philosophers or historians or anybody to talk sense about the truncated Age of Space. Two hours after the firing of The Whale was called off indefinitely, the Reverend Bobby Denton shouted at his Love Crusade in Wheeling, West Virginia:\n\" \u2019And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the Lord said, \"Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do; and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another\u2019s speech.\" So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of the earth.\u2019 \"\nBobby Denton spitted his audience on a bright and loving gaze, and proceeded to roast it whole over the coals of its own iniquity. \"Are these not Bible times?\" he said. \"Have we not builded of steel and pride an abomination far taller than the Tower of Babel of old? And did we not mean, like those builders of old, to get right into Heaven with it? And haven\u2019t we heard it said many times that the language of scientists is international? They all use the same Latin and Greek words for things, and they all talk the language of numbers.\" This seemed a particularly damning piece of evidence to Denton, and the Love Crusaders agreed bleakly without quite understanding why.\n\"So why should we cry out in surprise and pain now when God says to us what He said to the people who builded the Tower of Babel: \u2019No! Get away from there! You aren\u2019t going to Heaven or anywhere else with that thing! Scatter, you hear? Quit talking the language of science to each other! Nothing will be restrained from you which you have imagined to do, if you all keep on talking the language of science to each other, and I don\u2019t want that! I, your Lord God on High want things restrained from you, so you will quit thinking about crazy towers and rockets to Heaven, and start thinking about how to be better neighbors and husbands and wives and daughters and sons! Don\u2019t look to rockets for salvation\u2014 look to your homes and churches!\u2019 \"\nBobby Denton\u2019s voice grew hoarse and hushed. \"You want to fly through space? God has already given you the most wonderful space ship in all creation! Yes! Speed? You want speed? The space ship God has given you goes sixty-six thousand miles an hour\u2014and will keep on running at that speed for all eternity, if God wills it. You want a space ship that will carry men in comfort? You\u2019ve got it! It won\u2019t carry just a rich man and his dog, or just five men or ten men. No! God is no piker! He\u2019s given you a space ship that will carry billions of men, women, and children! Yes! And they don\u2019t have to stay strapped in chairs of wear fishbowls over their heads. No! Not on God\u2019s space ship. The people on God\u2019s space ship can go swimming, and walk in the sunshine and play baseball and go ice skating and go for family rides in the family automobile on Sunday after church and a family chicken dinner!\"\nBobby Denton nodded. \"Yes!\" he said. \"And if anybody thinks his God is mean for putting things out in space to stop us from flying out there, just let him remember the space ship God already gave us. And we don\u2019t have to buy the fuel for it, and worry and fret over what kind of fuel to use. No!

El Dorado, the four Americans, one claiming to be a Canadian, and the two Japanese, were still as good as gold everywhere on the planet. Again: The value of their money was imaginary. Like the nature of the universe itself, the desirability of their American dollars and yen was all in people\u2019s heads.\nAnd if Wait, who did not even know that there was a financial crisis going on, had carried out his masquerade as a Canadian to the extent of bringing Canadian dollars into Ecuador, he would not have been as well received as he was. Although Canada had not gone bankrupt, people\u2019s imaginations in more and more places, including Canada itself, were making them unhappy about trading anything really useful for Canadian dollars anymore.\nA similar decay in imagined value was happening to the British pound and the French and Swiss francs and the West German mark. The Ecuadorian sucre, meanwhile, named in honor of Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre (1795\u20131830), a national hero, had come to be worth less than a banana peel.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nUp in her room, Mary Hepburn was wondering if she had a brain tumor, and that was why her brain was giving her the worst possible advice all the time. It was a natural thing for her to suspect, since it was a brain tumor which had killed her husband Roy only three months before. It hadn\u2019t been enough for the tumor to kill him, either. It had to addle his memory and destroy his judgment first.\nShe had to wonder, too, when his tumor had begun to do that to him\u2014whether it wasn\u2019t the tumor which had made him sign them up for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century\u201d in the promising January of that ultimately horrible year.\nHere was how she found out he had signed them up for the cruise: She came home from work one afternoon, expecting Roy still to be at GEFFCo. He got off work an hour later than she did. But there Roy was, already, home, and it turned out that he had quit at noon. This was a man who adored the work he did with machinery, and who had never taken off so much as an hour from his job during his twenty-nine years with GEFFCo\u2014not for sickness, since he was never sick, not for anything.\nShe asked him if he was sick, and he said that he had never felt better in his life. He was proud of himself in what seemed to Mary the manner of an adolescent who was tired of being thought a good boy all the time. This was a man whose words were few and well-chosen, never silly or immature. But now he said incredibly, and with an inane expression to match, as though she were his disapproving mother: \u201cI played hookey.\u201d\nIt had to have been the tumor that said that, Mary now thought in Guayaquil. And the tumor couldn\u2019t have picked a worse day for carefree truancy, for there had been an ice storm the night before, and then wind-driven sleet all day. But Roy had gone up and down Clinton Street, the main street of Ilium, stopping in store after store and telling the salespeople that he was playing hookey.", 0.05798059964726632], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["crime", 0.0798270704030964], ["writing", 0.06549430451734453], ["find", 0.0643205747566206], ["writer", 0.05571760325318527], ["girl", 0.05571760325318527], ["mouth", 0.053669202633074245], ["reason", 0.048666036155651966], ["devote", 0.045940901989025985], ["seasick", 0.045940901989025985], ["remedy", 0.045940901989025985], ["spilling", 0.045940901989025985], ["emeralds", 0.045940901989025985], ["preened", 0.045940901989025985], ["dictionary", 0.045940901989025985], ["pinned", 0.045940901989025985], ["airy", 0.045940901989025985], ["nodded", 0.045940901989025985], ["toothless", 0.045940901989025985], ["sentences", 0.045940901989025985], ["hangover", 0.045940901989025985], ["difficult", 0.045940901989025985], ["advertisement", 0.045940901989025985], ["face", 0.04260852842924822], ["slazinger", 0.04031828114229444], ["duck", 0.0399135352015482], ["illustrate", 0.0399135352015482], ["typing", 0.0399135352015482], ["amateur", 0.0399135352015482], ["hardest", 0.0399135352015482], ["grinder", 0.0399135352015482], ["corpse", 0.0399135352015482], ["patronized", 0.036387751652781554], ["capote", 0.036387751652781554], ["main", 0.036387751652781554], ["sixteen", 0.036387751652781554], ["organ", 0.036387751652781554], ["truman", 0.036387751652781554], ["religion", 0.036387751652781554], ["quiet", 0.036387751652781554], ["sailor", 0.036387751652781554], ["direction", 0.036387751652781554], ["complete", 0.036387751652781554], ["inches", 0.036387751652781554], ["stole", 0.036387751652781554], ["biography", 0.036387751652781554], ["build", 0.036387751652781554], ["rubies", 0.03388616841407042], ["quick", 0.03388616841407042], ["irony", 0.03388616841407042], ["staring", 0.03388616841407042], ["bodies", 0.03388616841407042], ["dead", 0.03332013736959156], ["surgeon", 0.03194578970699033], ["pills", 0.03194578970699033], ["diamonds", 0.03194578970699033], ["eleven", 0.03194578970699033], ["hoped", 0.03194578970699033], ["brain", 0.03036038486530377], ["attention", 0.03036038486530377], ["published", 0.03036038486530377], ["silence", 0.03036038486530377], ["thinks", 0.03036038486530377], ["picture", 0.029083231584239373], ["west", 0.029019944171153698], ["replied", 0.027858801626592634], ["miles", 0.027858801626592634], ["hamptons", 0.027858801626592634], ["lying", 0.027858801626592634], ["peace", 0.027858801626592634], ["novels", 0.027858801626592634], ["seventeen", 0.026834601316537122], ["ground", 0.025918422919512546], ["open", 0.025918422919512546], ["baltimore", 0.025918422919512546], ["needed", 0.025089638747301024], ["absolutely", 0.024333018077825983], ["alive", 0.022992577383675914], ["talking", 0.022992577383675914], ["brought", 0.022392639370745898], ["easy", 0.021831434839114847], ["write", 0.02130426421462411], ["full", 0.02080723452905934], ["care", 0.02080723452905934], ["serious", 0.02080723452905934], ["hard", 0.02033708477888303], ["pollock", 0.019891056132034762], ["close", 0.019466793834909266], ["man", 0.018756714945165606], ["beautiful", 0.017950677424954677], ["husband", 0.01666006868479578], ["lot", 0.016365272583268115], ["ago", 0.015536488411056594], ["died", 0.014779867741581553], ["woman", 0.013863689344556977], ["thing", 0.01323481402647327], ["asked", 0.010052776901677364], ["house", 0.009913643498664835], ["people", 0.008752500954103766], ["years", 0.008056477409116494]], "sentiment": ["\u201cNot a duck and not an organ-grinder and not a sailor and his girl,\u201d she said. \u201cA whole lot of dead bodies lying every which way on the ground.

days of the Roman games, most likely. A more meticulous historian might suggest that my European ancestors no doubt enslaved themselves to their own military commanders from time to time. When I examine my genealogy over the past century and a little more, however, I find no war lovers of any kind.\nMy father and grandfathers were in no wars. Only one of my four great-grandfathers was in a war, the Civil War. This was Peter Lieber, born in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, in 1832. My mother\u2019s maiden name was Lieber. This Peter Lieber, who is no more real to me than to you, came to America with one million other Germans in 1848. His father was a brush manufacturer. He was living in New Ulm, Minnesota, running a general store and trading for furs with the Indians, when the Civil War broke out. When Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers, Peter Lieber joined the 22nd Minnesota Battery of Light Artillery, and served for two years until wounded and honorably discharged.\n\u201cThe knee-joint of his right leg was permanently damaged, and he walked with a limp to the end of his days,\u201d according to my Uncle John Rauch (1890-1976). Uncle John was not in fact my uncle, but the husband of a first cousin of my father, Gertrude Schnull Rauch. He was a Harvard graduate and a distinguished Indianapolis lawyer. Toward the end of his life, he made himself an historian, a griot, of his wife\u2019s family\u2014in part my family, too, although he was not related to it by blood, but only by marriage.\nI am a highly diluted relative of his wife, and did not expect to appear as more than a footnote in the history\u2014and so I was properly astonished when he one day made me a gift of a manuscript entitled \u201cAn Account of the Ancestry of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., by an Ancient Friend of His Family.\u201d It was painstakingly researched and better written, by Uncle John himself, than much of my own stuff, sad to say. That manuscript is the most extravagant gift I ever expect to receive\u2014and it came from a man who had never spoken favorably of my work in my presence, other than to say that he was \u201csurprised by my convincing tone of authority,\u201d and that he was sure I would make a great deal of money.\nWhen I published my first short story, which was \u201cReport on the Barnhouse Effect,\u201d in Collier\u2019s, its hero was a man who could control dice by thinking hard about them, and who could eventually loosen bricks in chimneys a mile away, and so on\u2014and Uncle John said, \u201cNow you will hear from every nut in the country.

vaults of the Rosewater County National Bank, began to throw lavish banquets for morons, perverts, starvelings and the unemployed.\nThey listened tirelessly to the misshapen fears and dreams of people who, by almost anyone's standards, would have been better off dead, gave them love and trifling sums of money. The only social life they had that was untainted by pity had to do with the Rosewater Volunteer Fire Department. Eliot arose quickly to the rank of Fire Lieutenant, and Sylvia was elected President of the Ladies' Auxiliary. Though Sylvia had never before touched a bowling ball, she was made captain of the auxiliary's bowling team, too.\nAvondale's clammy respect for the monarchy turned to incredulous contempt, and then to savagery. Yahooism, drinking, cuckolding, and self-esteem all took sharp upturns. The voices of Avondale acquired the tone of bandsaws cutting galvanized tin when discussing the King and Queen, as though a tyranny had been overthrown. Avondale was no longer a settlement of rising young executives. It was peopled by vigorous members of the true ruling class.\nFive years later, Sylvia suffered a nervous collapse, burned the firehouse down. So sadistic had republican Avondale become about the royalist Rosewaters that Avondale laughed.\nSylvia was placed in a private mental hospital in Indianapolis, was taken there by Eliot and Charley Warmergran, the Fire Chief. They took her in the Chief's car, which was a red Henry J with a siren on top. They turned her over to a Dr. Ed Brown, a young psychiatrist who later made his reputation describing her illness. In the paper, he called Eliot and Sylvia \"Mr. and Mrs. Z,\" and he called the town of Rosewater \"Hometown, U.S.A.\" He coined a new word for Sylvia's disease, \"Samaritrophia,\" which he said meant, \"hysterical indifference to the troubles of those less fortunate than oneself.\"\nNorman Mushari now read Dr. Brown's treatise, which was also in the confidential files of McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee. His eyes were moist and soft and brown, compelling him to see the pages as he saw the world, as though through a quart of olive oil.\nSamaritrophia, he read, is the suppression of an overactive conscience by the rest of the mind. \"You must all take instructions from me!\" the conscience shrieks, in effect, to all the other mental processes. The other processes try it for a while, note that the conscience is unappeased, that it continues to shriek, and they note, too, that the outside world has not been even microscopically improved by the unselfish acts the conscience had demanded.\nThey rebel at last. They pitch the tyrannous conscience down an oubliette, weld shut the manhole cover of that dark dungeon. They can hear the conscience no more. In the sweet silence, the mental processes look about for a new leader, and the leader most prompt to appear whenever the conscience is stilled, Enlightened Self-interest, does appear. Enlightened Self-interest gives them a flag, which they adore on sight. It is essentially the black and white Jolly Roger, with these words written beneath the skull and crossbones, \"The hell with you, Jack, I've got mine!\"\nIt seemed unwise to me, Dr. Brown wrote and Norman Mushari read slaveringly, to set the noisy conscience of Mrs. Z at liberty again. Neither could I take much satisfaction in discharging her while she was as heartless as Ilse Koch. I made it the goal of my treatments, then, to keep her conscience imprisoned, but to lift the lid of the oubliette ever so slightly, so that the howls of the prisoner might be very faintly heard. Through trial and error with chemotherapy and electric shock, this I achieved. I was not proud, for I had calmed a deep woman by making her shallow. I had blocked the underground rivers that connected her to the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and made her content with being a splash pool three feet across, four inches deep, chlorinated, and painted blue.\nSome doctor!", -0.013101010101010106], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["table", 0.07427377525625646], ["rifle", 0.06567824776884434], ["windows",

an office wing abutting the north wall of the bell tower. He was in a long gallery, also of Venetian inspiration, which had a window every ten feet and a mirror at its far end. The mirror made its length appear to be infinite. The windows looked out over the plaza. It was in this gallery that the four sharpshooters supplied by Pinkerton set up their places of business. Each installed a table at his chosen window and set a comfortable chair behind that. There was a rifle rest on each table.\nThe sharpshooter nearest Alexander had put a sandbag on his table and had hammered a groove into it with the edge of his hairy hand. There his rifle would rest, with its butt tucked into his shoulder, as he squinted down his sights at this face or that face in the crowd from his easy chair. The sharpshooter farther down the corridor was a machinist by trade, and had built a squat tripod with a swiveling oarlock on top. This squatted on his table. It was into this oarlock that he would slip his rifle if trouble came.\n\u201cPatent applied for,\u201d he had told Alexander of his tripod, and he had patted the thing.\nEach man had his ammunition and his cleaning rod and his cleaning patches and his oil laid out on the table, as though they might be for sale.\nAll the windows were still closed now. At some of the others were far angrier and less orderly men. These were regular company guards, who had been up most of the night. Several had been drinking, so they said \u201c\u2026 to stay awake.\u201d They had been stationed at the windows with their rifles or shotguns\u2014in case the mob should attack the factory at all costs, and nothing but withering fire would turn them away.\nThey had persuaded themselves by now that this attack would surely come. Their alarm and bravado were the first strong hints young Alexander received, as he would tell young Walter F. Starbuck decades afterward, again stammering, that there were \u201ccertain instabilities inherent in the pageant.\u201d\nHe himself, of course, was carrying a loaded revolver in his overcoat pocket\u2014and so were his father and brother, who now came into the corridor to approve of the arrangements one last time. It was ten o\u2019clock in the morning. It was time to open the windows, they said.

under hideously overcrowded conditions, had grown to 10,000. And then, 1 cold winter\u2019s night, it became the scene of the biggest prison break in American history. Until then, nobody had ever escaped from Athena.\nSuddenly, everybody was free to leave, and to take a weapon from the prison armory, too, if he had use for 1. The lake between the prison and the little college was frozen solid, as easily traversed as the parking lot of a great shopping mall.\nWhat next?\nYES, AND BY the time Andr\u00e9 Lutz\u2019s bells were at last made to sing as a carillon, Tarkington College had not only a new library but luxurious dormitories, a science building, an art building, a chapel, a theater, a dining hall, an administration building, 2 new buildings of classrooms, and athletic facilities that were the envy of the institutions with which it had begun to compete in track and fencing and swimming and baseball, which were Hobart, the University of Rochester, Cornell, Union, Amherst, and Bucknell.\nThese structures bore the names of wealthy families as grateful as the Moellenkamps for all the college had managed to do for offspring of theirs whom conventional colleges had deemed ineducable. Most were unrelated to the Moellenkamps or to anyone who carried the Tarkington gene of dyslexia. Nor were the young they sent to Tarkington necessarily troubled by dyslexia. All sorts of different things were wrong with them, including an inability to write legibly with pen and ink, although what they tried to write down made perfect sense, and stammering so severe as to prevent their saying a word in class, and petit mal, which caused their minds to go perfectly blank for seconds or minutes anywhere, anytime, and so on.\nIt was simply the Moellenkamps who first challenged the new little college to do what it could for a seemingly hopeless case of plutocratic juvenile incapacity, namely Henry. Not only would Henry graduate with honors from Tarkington. He would go on to Oxford, taking with him a male companion who read aloud to him and wrote down thoughts Henry could only express orally. Henry would become 1 of the most brilliant speakers in a golden age of American purple, bow-wow oratory, and serve as a Congressman and then a United States Senator from Ohio for 36 years.\nTHAT SAME HENRY Moellenkamp was author of the lyrics to one of the most popular turn-of-the-century ballads, \u201cMary, Mary, Where Have You Gone?\u201d\nThe melody of that ballad was composed by Henry\u2019s friend Paul Dresser, brother of the novelist Theodore Dreiser. This was 1 of the rare instances in which Dresser set another man\u2019s words to music instead of his own. And then Henry appropriated that tune and wrote, or rather dictated, new words which sentimentalized student life in this valley.\nThus was \u201cMary, Mary, Where Have You Gone?\u201d transmogrified into the alma mater of this campus until it became a penitentiary 2 years ago.\nHistory.", 0.13067771874590053], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["spirits", 0.14163837296149256], ["general", 0.13998232491536847], ["operator", 0.13434551068973438], ["groszinger", 0.12283822779166315], ["find", 0.11626574778142472], ["radio", 0.10661962346733656], ["blow", 0.09723519572520375], ["hell", 0.09638228850184855], ["ship", 0.09442558197432839], ["sir", 0.08519889401308207], ["hitting", 0.07791392556041814], ["suppress", 0.07791392556041814], ["wider", 0.0686719631529522], ["omen", 0.0686719631529522], ["won", 0.06793886802738748], ["war", 0.06512925427651212], ["cheese", 0.06326576171151001], ["relax", 0.06326576171151001], ["orbit", 0.06326576171151001], ["finds", 0.06326576171151001], ["rice", 0.06258764948173012], ["sergeant", 0.05943000074548626], ["choice", 0.05943000074548626], ["shooting", 0.05645475339463013], ["outer", 0.05645475339463013], ["nuts", 0.05645475339463013], ["experiment", 0.05645475339463013], ["enemy", 0.05645475339463013], ["rocket", 0.054023799304044065], ["discovery", 0.054023799304044065], ["going", 0.048352617152068955], ["space", 0.047212790987164195], ["green", 0.047212790987164195], ["dane", 0.047212790987164195], ["voices", 0.04478183689657813], ["forget", 0.043714600794264306], ["send", 0.043714600794264306], ["moon", 0.04272649449888136], ["exactly", 0.04094607593055438], ["damn", 0.04013774763966858], ["start", 0.03937563545513594], ["telling", 0.03797082857969825], ["understand", 0.03499558122884212], ["major", 0.033484532091415414], ["business", 0.02807833064997322], ["guess", 0.02715842569681387], ["three", 0.024976700046389837], ["hear", 0.02377468541979921], ["people", 0.018522628277038027], ["man", 0.012709270517461412]], "sentiment": ["\u201cNothing would, then,\u201d said Groszinger.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly right.

The fact that human beings are now the only animals left on Earth, I confess, seems a confusing sort of victory. Those of you familiar with the nature of my earlier published works will understand why I mourned especially when the last beaver died.\n\u201cThere were two monsters sharing this planet with us when I was a boy, however, and I celebrate their extinction today. They were determined to kill us, or at least to make our lives meaningless. They came close to success. They were cruel adversaries, which my little friends the beavers were not. Lions? No. Tigers? No. Lions and tigers snoozed most of the time. The monsters I will name never snoozed. They inhabited our heads. They were the arbitrary lusts for gold, and, God help us, for a glimpse of a little girl\u2019s underpants.\n\u201cI thank those lusts for being so ridiculous, for they taught us that it was possible for a human being to believe anything, and to behave passionately in keeping with that belief\u2014any belief.\n\u201cSo now we can build an unselfish society by devoting to unselfishness the frenzy we once devoted to gold and to underpants.\u201d\nHe paused, and then he recited with wry mournfulness the beginning of a poem he had learned to scream in Bermuda, when he was a little boy.

She used to say, \u201cYour parents ruin the first half of your life, and your kids ruin the second half.\u201d\nJames Whitcomb Riley, \u201cThe Hoosier Poet,\u201d was the highest-paid American writer of his time, 1849 to 1916, because he recited his poetry for money in theaters and lecture halls. That was how delighted by poetry ordinary Americans used to be. Can you imagine?\nYou want to know something the great French writer Jean-Paul Sartre said one time? He said, in French of course, \u201cHell is other people.\u201d He refused to accept a Nobel Prize. I could never be that rude. I was raised right by our African-American cook, whose name was Ida Young.\nDuring the Great Depression, African-American citizens were heard to say this, along with a lot of other stuff, of course: \u201cThings are so bad white folks got to raise their own kids.\u201d\nBut I wasn\u2019t raised right by Ida Young alone, a great-grandchild of slaves, who was intelligent, kind and honorable, proud and literate, articulate and thoughtful and pleasing in appearance. Ida Young loved poetry, and used to read poems to me.\nI was also raised right by teachers at School 43, \u201cThe James Whitcomb Riley School,\u201d and then at Shortridge High School. Back then, great public school teachers were local celebrities. Grateful former students, well into adult life, used to visit them, and tell them how they were doing. And I myself used to be a sentimental adult like that.\nBut long ago now, all my favorite teachers went the way of most of the polar bears.\nThe very best thing you can be in life is a teacher, provided that you are crazy in love with what you teach, and that your classes consist of eighteen students or fewer. Classes of eighteen students or fewer are a family, and feel and act like one.\nWhen my grade graduated from School 43, with the Great Depression going on, with almost no business or jobs, and with Hitler taking charge of Germany, each of us had to say in writing what we hoped to do when grown-ups to make this a better world.\nI said I would cure cancer with chemicals, while working for Eli Lilly.", 0.2203809523809524], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
