Yet no heavenly bodies at all seem to be there.\"\n\"Well!\" Lew said in mock surprise. \"I should say that is something! Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in radio history, we bring you the noise from Dr. Bockman\u2019s mysterious voids.\" They had strung a line out to Fred\u2019s antenna on the campus. Lew waved to the engineer to switch in the signals coming from it. \"Ladies and gentlemen, the voice of nothingness!\"\nThe noise wasn\u2019t much to hear\u2014a wavering hiss, more like a leaking tire than anything else. It was supposed to be on the air for five seconds. When the engineer switched it off, Fred and I were inexplicably grinning like idiots. I felt relaxed and tingling. Lew Harrison looked as though he\u2019d stumbled into the dressing room at the Copacabana. He glanced at the studio clock, appalled. The monotonous hiss had been on the air for five minutes! If the engineer\u2019s cuff hadn\u2019t accidentally caught on the switch, it might be on yet.\nFred laughed nervously, and Lew hunted for his place in the script. \"The hiss from nowhere,\" Lew said. \"Dr. Bockman, has anyone proposed a name for these interesting voids?\"\n\"No,\" Fred said. \"At the present time they have neither a name nor an explanation.\"\nThe voids the hiss came from have still to be explained, but I\u2019ve suggested a name for them that shows plans of sticking: \"Bockman\u2019s\u2019Euphoria.\" We may not know what the voids are, but we know what they do, so the name\u2019s a good one. Euphoria, since it means a sense of buoyancy and well-being, is really the only word that will do.\nAfter the broadcast, Fred, Lew, and I were cordial to one another to the point of being maudlin.\n\"I can\u2019t remember when a broadcast has been such a pleasure,\" Lew said.

We\u2019re done. We aren\u2019t made to work and fight in huge hordes, to live by instinct and nothing more, perpetuating a dark, damp anthill without the wits even to wonder why!\u201d\nThey both fell into red-faced silence as Borgorov navigated the last hundred yards. \u201cCome now,\u201d said Borgorov, rounding the corner of the toolshed, \u201cour samples couldn\u2019t have been as disappointing as all that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that we\u2019re tired,\u201d said Josef, giving his ingratiating grin. \u201cThe fossils are so sensational we\u2019re stunned.\u201d\nPeter gently laid the chip with the murdered ant and its attackers embedded in it on the last pile. \u201cWe have the most significant samples from each layer arranged in these piles,\u201d he said, pointing to the row of rock mounds. He was curious to see what Borgorov\u2019s reaction might be. Over Josef\u2019s objections, he explained about two kinds of ants evolving within the species, showed him the houses and books and pictures in the lower levels, the crowded gatherings in the upper ones. Then, without offering the slightest interpretation, he gave Borgorov his magnifying glass, and stepped back.\nBorgorov strolled up and down the row several times, picking up samples and clucking his tongue. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be more graphic, could it?\u201d he said at last.\nPeter and Josef shook their heads.\n\u201cObviously,\u201d said Borgorov, \u201cwhat happened was this.\u201d He picked up the chip that showed the bas-relief of the pincerless ant\u2019s death struggle with countless warriors. \u201cThere were these lawless ants, such as the one in the center, capitalists who attacked and exploited the workers\u2014ruthlessly killing, as we can see here, scores at a time.\u201d He set down the melancholy exhibit, and picked up the house into which the pincerless ants were crammed. \u201cAnd here we have a conspiratorial meeting of the lawless ants, plotting against the workers.

It is common for people to find his work impossible to read, not because of what he happens to be saying on a given page but because of unforgivable things he has said or written elsewhere.\nHe said often enough himself, one way or another and as a universally despised old man and war criminal, that he had nothing to apologize for, and that forgiveness would be yet another insult from nincompoops.\nHe would not like me.
