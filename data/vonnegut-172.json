There was a very good chance that Mary Kathleen had been creamed by one of her own taxicabs.\nHer nose was broken, which was where the blood had come from. There were worse things wrong with her. I cannot name them. No inventory was ever taken of everything that was broken in Mary Kathleen.\nShe had hidden herself in a toilet stall. The drops of blood showed me where to look. There could be no doubt as to who was in there. Her basketball shoes were visible beneath the door.\nAt least there was not a corpse in there. When I crooned my name and my harmlessness again, she unlatched the door and pulled it open. She was not using the toilet, but simply sitting on it. She might as well have been Using it, her humiliation by life was now so complete. Her nosebleed had stopped, but it had left her with an Adolf Hitler mustache.\n\u201cOh!

The purpose of the engine resulting was to dilute and dilute and dilute the vibrations from the tape recorder. The vibrations, before they reached the stone floor, had to struggle through the dead canvas of the stretcher, down the stretcher handles, through the ironing boards, and finally through the fiber pads on the feet of the ironing boards.\nThe dilution was a safety measure. It guaranteed that no harmonium would get a lethal overdose of music.\nBoaz now put the tape in the recorder and turned the recorder on. Throughout the concert, he would stand guard by the apparatus. His duty was to see that no creature crept too close to the apparatus. His duty, when a creature crept too close, was to peel the creature from the wall or floor, scold it, and paste it up again a hundred yards or more away.\n\"If you ain\u2019t got no more sense than that,\" he would say in his thoughts to the foolhardy harmonium, \"you\u2019re going to wind up out here in left field ever\u2019 time. Think it over.\"\nActually, a creature placed a hundred yards from the tape recorder still got plenty of music to eat.\nThe walls of the caves were so extraordinarily conductive, in fact, that harmoniums on cave walls miles away got whiffs of Boaz\u2019s concerts through the stone.\nUnk, who had been following the tracks deeper and deeper into the caves, could tell from the way the harmoniums were behaving that Boaz was staging a concert. He had reached a warm level where the harmoniums were thick.

The music was making them do it.\nUnk laid his pack down, then laid himself down to rest.\nUnk dreamed about colors other than yellow and aquamarine.\nThen he dreamed that his good friend Stony Stevenson was waiting for him around the next bend.

He was being a very good sport. He had no intention of climbing up on truck for another swing at Wayne. He was winded, for one thing. For another, he understood that Wayne was a perfect dodging machine. Only a perfect hitting machine could hit him. \u201cYou\u2019re too good for me,\u201d said Dwayne.\nSo Dwayne backed away some, contented himself with preaching up at Wayne. He spoke about human slavery\u2014not only black slaves, but white slaves, too. Dwayne regarded coal miners and workers on assembly lines and so forth as slaves, no matter what color they were. \u201cI used to think that was such a shame,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to think the electric chair was a shame. I used to think war was a shame\u2014and automobile accidents and cancer,\u201d he said, and so on.\nHe didn\u2019t think they were shames anymore. \u201cWhy should I care what happens to machines?\u201d he said.\nWayne Hoobler\u2019s face had been blank so far, but now it began to bloom with uncontrollable awe. His mouth fell open.\nThe runway lights of Will Fairchild Memorial Airport had just come on. Those lights looked like miles and miles of bewilderingly beautiful jewelry to Wayne. He was seeing a dream come true on the other side of the Interstate.\nThe inside of Wayne\u2019s head lit up in recognition of that dream, lit up with an electric sign which gave a childish name to the dream\u2014like this:\n24\nLISTEN: Dwayne Hoover hurt so many people seriously that a special ambulance known as Martha was called, Martha was a full-sized General Motors transcontinental bus, but with the seats removed. There were beds for thirty-six disaster victims in there, plus a kitchen and a bathroom and an operating room. It had enough food and medical supplies aboard to serve as an independent little hospital for a week without help from the outside world.\nIts full name was The Martha Simmons Memorial Mobile Disaster Unit, named in honor of the wife of Newbolt Simmons, a County Commissioner of Public Safety. She had died of rabies contracted from a sick bat she found clinging to her floor-to-ceiling livingroom draperies one morning. She had just been reading a biography of Albert Schweitzer, who believed that human beings should treat simpler animals lovingly.

Except for us, that street was as quiet as a stretch of the Sahara Desert.\nThere wasn\u2019t anything to see at all on the President\u2019s side, except for a new, peeled-cedar fence about eight feet high and two hundred feet long, with a gate in it. The Rumfoord cottage faced the gate from across the street. It was the biggest house, and one of the oldest, in the village. It was stucco. It had towers and balconies, and a veranda that ran around all four sides.\nOn a second-floor balcony was a huge portrait of Barry Goldwater. It had bicycle reflectors in the pupils of its eyes. Those eyes stared right through the Kennedy gate. There were floodlights all around it, so I could tell it was lit up at night. And the floodlights were rigged with blinkers.\nA man who sells storm windows can never be really sure about what class he belongs to, especially if he installs the windows, too. So I was prepared to keep out from under foot, and go about my business, measuring the windows. But the Commodore welcomed me like a guest of great importance. He invited me to cocktails and dinner, and to spend the night. He said I could start measuring the next day.\nSo we had martinis out on the veranda. Only we didn\u2019t sit on the most pleasant side, which looked out on the Yacht Club dock and the harbor. We sat on the side that looked out on all the poor tourists being shunted off toward Hyannis. The Commodore liked to talk about all those fools out there.\n\"Look at them!\" he said. \"They wanted glamour, and now they realize they\u2019re not going to get it. They actually expected to be invited to play touch football with Eunice and Frank Sinatra and the Secretary of Health and Welfare. Glamour is what they voted for, and look at \u2019em now. They don\u2019t even get to look at a Kennedy chimney up above the trees. All the glamour they\u2019ll get out of this administration is an overpriced waffle named Caroline.\"\nA helicopter went over, very low, and it landed somewhere inside the Kennedy fence. Clarice said she wondered who it was.\n\"Pope John the Sixth,\" said the Commodore.\nThe butler, whose name was John, came out with a big bowl. I thought it was peanuts or popcorn, but it turned out to be Goldwater buttons. The Commodore had John take the bowl out to the street, and offer buttons to the people in cars.

It lasted 2 days longer than the Battle of Gettysburg, at which Elias Tarkington was shot by a Confederate soldier who mistook him for Abraham Lincoln.\nOn the night of the prison break, I was as helpless a voyeur, once the attack had begun, as Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg or Napoleon Bonaparte at Waterloo.\nThere was 1 shot fired by someone in Scipio. I will never know who did it. It was some night owl with a loaded gun in easy reach. Whoever did it must have been killed soon afterward, otherwise he would have bragged about what he had done so early in the game.\nTHOSE WERE GOOD soldiers who crossed the ice. Several of them had been in Vietnam, and so, like me, had had lessons in Military Science on full scholarships from the Government. Others had had plenty of experience with shooting and being shot at, often from early childhood on, and so found a single shot unremarkable. They saved their ammunition until they could see clearly what they were shooting at.\nWhen those seasoned troops went ashore, that was when they commenced firing. They were stingy with their bullets. There would be a bang, and then silence for several minutes, and then, when another target appeared, maybe a bleary-eyed householder coming out his front door or peering out a window, with or without a weapon, there would be another bang or 2 or 3 bangs, and then silence again. The escaped convicts, or Freedom Fighters as they would soon call themselves, had to assume, after all, that many if not most households had firearms, and that their owners had long daydreamed of using them with deadly effect should precisely what was happening happen. The Freedom Fighters had no choice. I would have done the same thing, had I been in their situation.\nBang. Somebody else would jerk backward and downward, like a professional actor on a TV show.\nTHE BIGGEST FLURRY of shots came from what I guessed from afar to be the parking lot in back of the Black Cat Caf\u00e9, where the prostitutes parked their vans. The men who visited the vans that late at night had handguns with them, just in case. Better safe than sorry.\nAND THEN I could tell from the sporadic firing that the Freedom Fighters had begun to climb the hill to the college, which was brightly lit all night every night to discourage anybody who might be tempted to do harm up here. From my point of view across the lake, Tarkington might have been mistaken for an emerald-studded Oz or City of God or Camelot.\nYOU CAN BET I did not go back to sleep that night. I listened and listened for sirens, for helicopters, for the rumble of armored vehicles, for proofs that the forces of law and order would soon put a stop to the violence in the valley with even greater violence. At dawn the valley was as quiet as ever, and the red light on top of the water tower on the summit of Musket Mountain, as though nothing remarkable had happened over there, winked off and on, off and on.\nI WENT NEXT door to the Warden\u2019s house. I woke up his 3 servants. They had gone back to bed after the Warden charged up the hill in his Isuzu. These were old, old men, sentenced to life in prison without hope of parole, back when I was a little boy in Midland City. I hadn\u2019t even learned to read and write, probably, when they ruined some lives, or were accused of doing so, and were forced to lead lives not worth living as a consequence.", 0.10750580720092912], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["camera", 0.09336144854088535], ["film", 0.09336144854088535], ["mantelpiece", 0.08675963584716985], ["mccarthy", 0.07921558771313136], ["cliff", 0.07921558771313136], ["packs", 0.0716715395790929], ["radioactive", 0.06779485734710233], ["wheels", 0.062240965693923574], ["painter", 0.05857067114826443], ["pack", 0.056724433610819296], ["magazine", 0.05281039180875425], ["ohio", 0.03677800522986942], ["ruining", 0.03583576978954645], ["photographed", 0.03583576978954645], ["publicity", 0.03583576978954645], ["bag", 0.03583576978954645], ["passionate", 0.03583576978954645], ["philanthropist", 0.03583576978954645], ["forgave", 0.03583576978954645], ["financed", 0.03583576978954645], ["exposures", 0.03583576978954645], ["tripod", 0.03583576978954645], ["buying", 0.03583576978954645], ["objecting", 0.03583576978954645], ["physics", 0.03583576978954645], ["fred", 0.03394924403841561], ["art", 0.03312441925179744], ["brain", 0.031120482846961787], ["include", 0.031120482846961787], ["widow", 0.031120482846961787], ["historian", 0.031120482846961787], ["flat", 0.031120482846961787], ["services", 0.031120482846961787], ["barry", 0.030249465596461293], ["killed", 0.028432711955311326], ["unfinished", 0.028362216805409648], ["highly", 0.028362216805409648], ["taught", 0.028362216805409648], ["cleveland", 0.028362216805409648], ["someplace", 0.028362216805409648], ["involved", 0.028362216805409648], ["reverend", 0.026405195904377125], ["harrell", 0.026405195904377125], ["described", 0.026405195904377125], ["photograph", 0.026405195904377125], ["swung", 0.026405195904377125], ["polite", 0.026405195904377125], ["hadn", 0.025857990871793933], ["accidentally", 0.024887212562103588], ["tumors", 0.024887212562103588], ["picked", 0.024887212562103588], ["received", 0.024887212562103588], ["horse", 0.024887212562103588], ["exposed", 0.024887212562103588], ["athens", 0.024887212562103588], ["caused", 0.023646929862824986], ["personal", 0.023646929862824986], ["fireplace", 0.023646929862824986], ["wild", 0.023646929862824986], ["visited", 0.023646929862824986], ["interstate", 0.023646929862824986], ["finally", 0.022598285782367448], ["couple", 0.022598285782367448], ["university", 0.022598285782367448], ["offered", 0.022598285782367448], ["paid", 0.022598285782367448], ["serious", 0.022598285782367448], ["funeral", 0.021689908961792462], ["opinion", 0.021689908961792462], ["painting", 0.020888663821272847], ["shitbox", 0.020888663821272847], ["close", 0.02017192561951893], ["longer", 0.02017192561951893], ["mother", 0.020007038528165228], ["eloise", 0.019523557049421478], ["lives", 0.019523557049421478], ["week", 0.019523557049421478], ["kind", 0.018931642920240323], ["working", 0.018931642920240323], ["case", 0.018931642920240323], ["telephone", 0.018931642920240323], ["story", 0.018931642920240323], ["book", 0.018931642920240323], ["read", 0.018387134704774093], ["best", 0.017882998839782786], ["days", 0.01741365957796679], ["guess", 0.016974622019207804], ["public", 0.016974622019207804], ["arts", 0.016974622019207804], ["life", 0.01596617138559493], ["friend", 0.01580557265235978], ["ago", 0.01580557265235978], ["center", 0.015456638676934267], ["weren", 0.015456638676934267], ["called", 0.015456638676934267], ["closed", 0.015124732798230647], ["place", 0.015124732798230647], ["black", 0.014808270106836817], ["wouldn", 0.014505877164178085], ["hoover", 0.013938655334660733], ["shot", 0.013415110837136047], ["turned", 0.013415110837136047], ["father", 0.013321176371878952], ["people", 0.01311283082801576], ["metzger", 0.012928995435896967], ["big", 0.012698372635382127], ["years", 0.012396589556105257], ["three", 0.01205000406528468], ["left", 0.011649728554924587], ["heard", 0.010573374777952518], ["long", 0.010409445855645984], ["celia", 0.010249374444692283], ["wasn", 0.010092983164252155]], "sentiment": ["I got off the wild horse of my own life story at Celia Hoover\u2019s funeral, I think\u2014when Reverend Harrell forgave me in public for having shot Eloise Metzger so long ago. If it wasn\u2019t then, it was only a couple of years after that, when Mother was finally killed by the radioactive mantelpiece.\nI had paid her back as best I could for ruining her life and Father\u2019s. She was no longer in need of personal services. The case was closed.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe probably never would have found out that it was the mantelpiece that killed her, if it weren\u2019t for an art historian from Ohio University over at Athens. His name was Cliff McCarthy. He was a painter, too. And Cliff McCarthy never would have got involved in our lives, if it hadn\u2019t been for all the publicity Mother received for objecting to the kind of art Fred T. Barry was buying for the arts center. He read about her in People magazine. Then again, Mother almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have become so passionate about taking Fred T. Barry on in the first place, if it hadn\u2019t been for little tumors in her brain, which had been caused by the radioactive mantelpiece.\nWheels within wheels!\nPeople magazine described Mother as the widow of an Ohio painter. Cliff McCarthy had been working for years, financed by a Cleveland philanthropist, on a book which was to include every serious Ohio painter, but he had never heard of Father. So he visited our little shitbox, and he photographed Father\u2019s unfinished painting over the fireplace. That was all there was to photograph, so he took several exposures of that with a big camera on a tripod. He was being polite, I guess.\nBut the camera used flat packs of four-by-five film, and he had exposed some of it elsewhere, so he got several packs out of his camera bag.\nHe accidentally left one behind\u2014on the mantelpiece. One week later he swung off the Interstate, on his way to someplace else, and he picked up the pack.\nThree days after that, he called me on the telephone to say that the film in the pack had all turned black, and that a friend of his who taught physics had offered the opinion that the film had been close to something which was highly radioactive.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.06451579670329671], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["bodovskov", 0.28539409551897915], ["booty", 0.2653934000076123], ["trunk", 0.18751737198660748], ["russian", 0.13769707760687402], ["wirtanen", 0.13661297441962458], ["translating", 0.0884644666692041], ["corporal", 0.0884644666692041], ["kremlin", 0.0884644666692041], ["pan", 0.0884644666692041], ["modestly", 0.0884644666692041], ["sending", 0.0884644666692041], ["ste", 0.0884644666692041], ["trunkful", 0.0884644666692041], ["fluent", 0.0884644666692041], ["stepan", 0.07728467343436628], ["villa", 0.07728467343436628], ["evidence", 0.07728467343436628], ["sea", 0.07728467343436628], ["interpreter", 0.07728467343436628], ["remarkably", 0.07728467343436628], ["sandbags", 0.07728467343436628], ["praised", 0.07728467343436628], ["practically", 0.07728467343436628], ["enter", 0.07728467343436628], ["translated", 0.07728467343436628], ["troops", 0.0707449136261701], ["literary", 0.0707449136261701], ["main", 0.0707449136261701], ["loft", 0.0707449136261701], ["instant", 0.0707449136261701], ["writings", 0.06610488019952845], ["poems", 0.06610488019952845], ["contents", 0.06610488019952845], ["goblet", 0.06610488019952845], ["decided", 0.06250579066220249], ["career", 0.06250579066220249], ["produced", 0.05956512039133226], ["windows", 0.05956512039133226], ["theater", 0.05956512039133226], ["published", 0.05132599742736466], ["fine", 0.04978873646277878], ["started", 0.04978873646277878], ["magazine", 0.04978873646277878], ["trial", 0.045899025868958006], ["turned", 0.04097351539232604], ["play", 0.04097351539232604], ["black", 0.037205533921656604], ["berlin", 0.037205533921656604], ["german", 0.0330775762742824]], "sentiment": ["\u201cThey were the main evidence in the trial of Ste-pan Bodovskov,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWho?\u201d I said.\n\u201cStepan Bodovskov was a corporal, an interpreter, with the first Russian troops to enter Berlin,\u201d said Wirtanen. \u201cHe found the trunk containing your writings in a theater loft.

He was scrubbed pink, and his hair was freshly cut.\n\u201cNo fast stuff, now, for a thousand miles, you hear?\u201d Daggett said. He was in a holiday mood, resigned to the bizarre wonder Kiah had wrought. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of fine jewelry under the hood, and you\u2019d better treat it right.

He hoped to look like a man who had made a sensible purchase and, satisfied with his money\u2019s worth, was going to take it home now. The moment for him was beautiful and funny, but he did not smile.\nHe put the car in gear for the first time. It was so easy. \u201cPardon me,\u201d he said to those in his way. He raced his engine rather than blow his brass choir of horns. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nWhen Kiah got the car onto the six-lane turnpike, he ceased feeling like an intruder in the universe. He was as much a part of it as the clouds and the sea. With the mock modesty of a god traveling incognito, he permitted a Cadillac convertible to pass him. A pretty girl at its wheel smiled down on him.\nKiah touched the throttle lightly and streaked around her. He laughed at the speck she became in his rearview mirror. The temperature gauge climbed, and Kiah slowed the Marittima-Frascati, forgiving himself this one indulgence. Just this once\u2014it had been worth it.
