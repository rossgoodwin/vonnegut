I had never thought of them as doors. They were a wall of my home which was made of wood rather than stone. Now Father took hold of the mighty bolt which had held them shut for thirty years. It resisted him for only a moment, and then slid back, as it had been born to do.\nUntil that moment, I had seen that bolt as just another dead piece of medieval iron on the wall. In the proper hands, perhaps it could have killed an enemy.\nI had felt the same way about the ornate hinges. But they weren\u2019t more junk from Europe. They were real Midland City, Ohio, hinges, ready to work at any time.\nI had stolen downstairs now, awe in every step I took.\nThe King of the Early Evening put his shoulder to one carriage-house door and then the other. A wall of my home vanished. There were stars and a rising moon where it had been.\n8\nAND MOTHER and Father and I all hid as Felix arrived with Celia Hildreth in the Keedsler touring car. Felix, too, was dazed by the lovely transformation of our home. When he switched off the Keedsler\u2019s idling engine, it was as though it went on idling anyway. In a voice just like the engine\u2019s, he was reassuring Celia that she needn\u2019t be afraid, even though she had never seen anything like this house before.\nI heard her say this: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t help being scared. I want to get out of here.\u201d I was just inside the great new doorway.\nThat should have been enough for Felix. He should have gotten her out of there. As she would say in a few minutes, she hadn\u2019t even wanted to go to the prom, but her parents had told her she had to, and she hated her dress and was ashamed to have anybody see her in it, and she didn\u2019t understand rich people, and didn\u2019t want to, and she was happiest when she was all alone and nobody could stare at her, and nobody could say things to her that she was supposed to reply to in some fancy, ladylike way\u2014and so on.\nFelix used to say that he didn\u2019t get her out of there because he wanted to show Father that he could keep a promise, even if Father couldn\u2019t.

shotgun as though he were surprised to see Haley standing before him. \u201cWell, sir,\u201d he interrupted, \u201cand what sunshine are you going to bring into our lives today? Shall we poison the well or burn the house down?\u201d\nHaley swallowed hard, turned, and shuffled upstairs to his room, past the darkened, closed door of Kitty, who mumbled in her sleep, and the open door of the beloved Hope. He paused a moment, to listen to her breathing.\nPinned to his bedsheet was a typewritten note, signed by Annie. There was a certain sweetness in his slumber, for before he closed his eyes, he concluded that insofar as disciplinary measures went, the General must have reached the limits of his imagination. He even managed a soft chuckle as he bunched his shirt under his head. \u201cNo pillow for three months,\u201d the note had said.\nHaley\u2019s conclusion was an accurate one, apparently, for nothing new in the way of punishments was forthcoming during the next two weeks. True, Haley was reminded again that his defections had killed his opportunities in the world of music; Hope was ordered to fill out application papers for a Miss Dingman\u2019s School for Ladies, located on an inaccessible ridge in the White Mountains, and Haley\u2019s, Hope\u2019s, and Kitty\u2019s pillows remained under padlock in the basement fruit locker, but no more devastation seemed likely.\nKitty flounced and pined about the house, but without conviction. She hadn\u2019t the wit to camouflage the fact that her twenty hours with Roy and his motorcycle had been something less than a string of pearls. This was disturbing to Hope and Haley, for the General took it as a demonstration of his infallible judgment. \u201cWhatever became of that nice Flemming boy and his gasoline bicycle?\u201d he would chortle at mealtimes. \u201cNever seems to show his intelligent face around here anymore.\u201d Kitty offered no rebuttal.\nAs the time for Hope\u2019s incarceration in the New Hampshire highlands drew near, she abandoned her stoicism to plead with the General to relent. It was after dinner one night, and Haley listened with excitement, for if Hope could win leniency, then so might he.\nThe General gave her his thoughtful attention, and nodded now and then at her more salient arguments. \u201cAre you through?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes, I guess so.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh, very moving,\u201d he said. He looked seriously from Hope to Haley and back again. \u201cI once knew a man, grew up with him, in fact,\u201d said the General. \u201cWhen he was a boy, his parents would threaten to take away his bicycle if he did something bad. Well, sir, he\u2019d go right ahead and do whatever bad thing it was, and they\u2019d let him keep his bicycle anyway. They didn\u2019t have the heart to take it away. Instead, they\u2019d tell him if he did it again, they wouldn\u2019t let him have any ice cream for a year. He\u2019d do it again, and they wouldn\u2019t have the heart to keep him from eating ice cream. And so it went; his parents would make terrible threats, but they never carried them out, not one.\u201d\n\u201cSo what happened to him finally?\u201d asked the indispensable Annie.", 0.054526515151515145], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["terrible", 0.25594747397996753], ["quiet", 0.23500460495655875], ["selection", 0.20905332653395517], ["doze", 0.20905332653395517], ["tentatively", 0.18017219401062412], ["corridor", 0.18017219401062412], ["wanting", 0.18017219401062412], ["wide", 0.16327781450611728], ["frames", 0.16327781450611728], ["hm", 0.15129106148729304], ["glasses", 0.15129106148729304], ["eyes", 0.14042294388664334], ["disease", 0.1343966819827862], ["fine", 0.1343966819827862], ["patient", 0.12797373698998377], ["um", 0.12797373698998377], ["doctor", 0.12240992896396202], ["talking", 0.12240992896396202], ["reading", 0.11750230247827938], ["told", 0.04284565792711041], ["billy", 0.008545645060104448]], "sentiment": ["\u201cDoctor\u2014\u201d said the patient tentatively.\n\u201cHm?\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so quiet.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou were talking away there\u2014and then you got so quiet.\u201d\n\u201cUm.\u201d\n\u201cYou see something terrible?\u201d\n\u201cTerrible?\u201d\n\u201cSome disease in my eyes?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Billy, wanting to doze again. \u201cYour eyes are fine.

And we are surely grateful for his fog which came in on little cat feet. But tonight seems an apt occasion as well for celebrating what he and other American socialists did during the first half of the past century, with art, with eloquence, with organizing skills, to elevate the self-respect, the dignity, and political acumen of American wage earners, of our working class.\nThat wage earners, without social position or higher education or wealth, are of inferior intellect is surely belied by the fact that two of the most splendid writers and speakers on the deepest subjects in American history were self-taught workmen. I speak, of course, of Carl Sandburg of Illinois, and Abraham Lincoln, of Kentucky, then Indiana, and finally Illinois. Both, may I say, were continental, freshwater people like ourselves.\nHooray for our team!\nI know upper-class graduates of Yale University who can\u2019t talk or write worth a nickel.\nSocialism is no more an evil word than Christianity.

Nobody today has any idea what a marriage is. I have to say that Mandarax\u2019s cynicism about the institution back in its heyday was largely justified. My own parents made each other miserable by getting married, and Mary Hepburn, when she was an old lady on Santa Rosalia, once told the furry Akiko that she and Roy had been, quite possibly, the only happily married couple in all of Ilium.\nWhat made marriage so difficult back then was yet again that instigator of so many other sorts of heartbreak: the oversize brain. That cumbersome computer could hold so many contradictory opinions on so many different subjects all at once, and switch from one opinion or subject to another one so quickly, that a discussion between a husband and wife under stress could end up like a fight between blindfolded people wearing roller skates.\nThe Hiroguchis, for example, whose susurrations Mary had heard through the back of her closet, were then changing their opinions of themselves and each other, and of love and sex and work and the world and so on, with lightning speed.\nIn one second, Hisako would think that her husband was very stupid, and that she was going to have to rescue herself and her female fetus.

Father used to own the building, thanks to a loan from the bank. After the bank failed, though, its receivers liquidated all its assets, foreclosing all the mortgages which were in arrears, which was most of them. Guess why they were in arrears? Practically everybody had been dumb enough to entrust their savings to El Banco Busto.\nSo the father I found reading Marilee\u2019s letters in the afternoon was a man who had become a mere tenant in a building he used to own. As for the shop downstairs: it was vacant, since he couldn\u2019t afford to rent that, too. All his machinery had been sold at auction anyway in order to get a few pennies for what we were: people who had been dumb enough to entrust his or her savings to El Banco Busto.\nWhat a comedy!\nFather looked up from Marilee\u2019s letters when I came in with my schoolbooks, and he said, \u201cYou know what this woman is? She has promised you everything, but she has nothing to give.\u201d He named the Armenian sociopath who had swindled him and Mother in Cairo. \u201cShe is the new Vartan Mamigonian,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said.\nAnd he said exactly as though the handwritten letters were bonds or insurance policies or whatever: \u201cI have just read the fine print.\u201d He went on to say that Marilee\u2019s first letters had been rich in phrases like \u201cMr. Gregory says,\u201d and \u201cMr. Gregory feels,\u201d and \u201cMr. Gregory wants you to know,\u201d but that, since the third letter, such locutions had entirely disappeared. \u201cThis is a nobody,\u201d he said, \u201cwho will never be anybody, who is trying to get somebody anyway, by stealing the reputation of Gregorian!\u201d\nI felt no shock. Some part of me had noticed the same thing about the letters. Some other part of me had managed to bury the bad, bad implications.\nI asked Father what had triggered this investigation at this time. He indicated ten books which had arrived for me from Marilee soon after I left for school. He had stacked them on the drainboard of our sink, a sink full of dirty dishes and pans. I examined them. They were young people\u2019s story classics of the day, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe, The Swiss Family Robinson, The Adventures of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, Tanglewood Tales, Gulliver\u2019s Travels, Tales from Shakespeare and so on. Reading matter for young people before the Second World War was a dozen universes removed from the unwanted pregnancies and incest and minimum-wage slavery and treacherous high school friendships and so on in the novels of Polly Madison.\nMarilee had sent me these books because they were vibrantly illustrated by Dan Gregory. They were not only the most beautiful artifacts in our apartment: they were about the most beautiful artifacts in all of Luma County, and I responded to them as such. \u201cHow nice of her!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWould you look at these! Would you look at these?\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d he said.", 0.08935341789992952], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "a-man-without-a-country": {"tfidf": [["medical", 0.07847230633343641], ["demand", 0.06331720708832181], ["posted", 0.06331720708832181], ["students", 0.06331720708832181], ["christians", 0.06331720708832181], ["blessed", 0.0523148708889576], ["pps", 0.0523148708889576], ["exactly", 0.0523148708889576], ["beatitudes", 0.0523148708889576], ["reality", 0.0523148708889576], ["constitution", 0.04587891679200261], ["geography", 0.031658603544160904], ["idealism", 0.031658603544160904], ["style", 0.031658603544160904], ["cheney", 0.031658603544160904], ["platform", 0.031658603544160904], ["appendicitis", 0.031658603544160904], ["moses", 0.031658603544160904], ["smart", 0.031658603544160904], ["frighteningly", 0.031658603544160904], ["courtroom", 0.031658603544160904], ["republican", 0.031658603544160904], ["clouds", 0.031658603544160904], ["sanity", 0.031658603544160904], ["athlete", 0.031658603544160904], ["upper", 0.031658603544160904], ["donald", 0.031658603544160904], ["keystone", 0.031658603544160904], ["cleckley", 0.031658603544160904], ["gathered", 0.031658603544160904], ["scary", 0.031658603544160904], ["professor", 0.031658603544160904], ["aka", 0.031658603544160904], ["rumsfeld", 0.031658603544160904], ["1941", 0.031658603544160904], ["commandments", 0.031658603544160904], ["respectable", 0.031658603544160904], ["pentagon", 0.031658603544160904], ["supremacists", 0.031658603544160904], ["tears", 0.031658603544160904], ["clinical", 0.031658603544160904], ["perfumed", 0.031658603544160904], ["georgia", 0.031658603544160904], ["invaded", 0.031658603544160904], ["vocal", 0.031658603544160904], ["sleaziest", 0.031658603544160904], ["classic", 0.031658603544160904], ["closeted", 0.031658603544160904], ["ideas", 0.031658603544160904], ["buildings", 0.031658603544160904], ["snatchers", 0.031658603544160904], ["mask", 0.031658603544160904], ["hervey", 0.031658603544160904], ["diagnosis", 0.031658603544160904], ["psychiatry", 0.031658603544160904], ["planks", 0.031658603544160904], ["george", 0.02844062649568341], ["coup", 0.0261574354444788], ["text", 0.0261574354444788], ["psychopathic", 0.0261574354444788], ["peacemakers", 0.0261574354444788], ["mention", 0.0261574354444788], ["foot", 0.0261574354444788], ["term", 0.0261574354444788], ["yale", 0.0261574354444788], ["hair", 0.0261574354444788], ["crust", 0.0261574354444788], ["body", 0.0261574354444788], ["martians", 0.0261574354444788], ["personable", 0.0261574354444788], ["published", 0.0261574354444788], ["personalities", 0.0261574354444788], ["cops", 0.0261574354444788], ["tat", 0.0261574354444788], ["pink", 0.0261574354444788], ["law", 0.0261574354444788], ["bush", 0.02387424439327419], ["consciences", 0.022939458396001304], ["break", 0.022939458396001304], ["dr", 0.022939458396001304], ["fought", 0.022939458396001304], ["low", 0.022939458396001304], ["perfectly", 0.022939458396001304], ["merciful", 0.022939458396001304], ["comedy", 0.022939458396001304], ["imaginable", 0.022939458396001304], ["dick", 0.020656267344796694], ["stand", 0.020656267344796694], ["sermon", 0.020656267344796694], ["eyes", 0.020656267344796694], ["tv", 0.018885286778810902], ["read", 0.018885286778810902], ["jesus", 0.018885286778810902], ["heard", 0.018885286778810902], ["happened", 0.0174382902963192], ["ten", 0.0174382902963192], ["mount", 0.0174382902963192], ["college", 0.01621487220245207], ["public", 0.01621487220245207], ["asked", 0.01621487220245207], ["white", 0.01621487220245207], ["stuff", 0.01515509924511459], ["feel", 0.01515509924511459], ["history", 0.01515509924511459], ["course", 0.013384118679128799], ["reason", 0.013384118679128799], ["children", 0.012627688680681776], ["god", 0.010713704102769967], ["called", 0.010713704102769967], ["country", 0.010166141630651302], ["war", 0.008290040217443125], ["people", 0.0041527630457503795]], "sentiment": ["called the children of God.\nAnd so on.\nNot exactly planks in a Republican platform.

Without looking directly at him, she waited for him to climb in beside her. They drove to the club in silence, with Paul feeling let down by the coarse, irrational reality of Finnerty. Over the years, he supposed bitterly, he must have created a wise and warm Finnerty in his imagination, an image that had little to do with the real man.\nAt the club door, Anita straightened Paul\u2019s tie, pulled her cape down to bare her shoulders, smiled, and pushed into the brightly lighted foyer.\nThe far end of the foyer opened into the bar, and there two dozen of the Ilium Works\u2019 bright young men, identical in their crew cuts and the tailoring of their tuxedos, surrounded two men in their middle fifties. One of the older men, Kroner, tall, heavy, and slow, listened to the youngsters with ponderous affectionateness. The other, Baer, slight and nervous, noisily and unconvincingly extroverted, laughed, nudged, and clapped shoulders, and maintained a continuous commentary on whatever was being said: \u201cFine, fine, right, sure, sure, wonderful, yes, yes, exactly, fine, good.\u201d\nIlium was a training ground, where fresh graduates were sent to get the feel of industry and then moved on to bigger things. The staff was young, then, and constantly renewing itself. The oldest men were Paul, and his second-in-command, Lawson Shepherd. Shepherd, a bachelor, stood by the bar, somewhat apart from the rest, looking wise, and faintly amused by the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of some of the youngsters\u2019 remarks.\nThe wives had congregated in two adjacent booths, and there spoke quietly and uneasily, and turned to look whenever the volume of voices rose above a certain level, or whenever the bass voice of Kroner rumbled through the haze of small talk with three or four short, wise, wonderfully pregnant words.\nThe youngsters turned to greet Paul and Anita effusively, with playful obsequiousness, with the air of having proprietorship over all good times, which they generously encouraged their elders to share in.", 0.18186111111111106], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["fuzz", 0.3384159618282318], ["francine", 0.2659511888824941], ["quietly", 0.23970196938718746], ["building", 0.18664325803240564], ["eden", 0.16862183052493013], ["bathing", 0.1476173705079621], ["entrance", 0.1476173705079621], ["shopping", 0.1476173705079621], ["shout", 0.13533054905013892], ["boom", 0.13533054905013892], ["ka", 0.13533054905013892], ["housetops", 0.13533054905013892], ["word", 0.13111048640366896], ["523", 0.11985098469359373], ["echoing", 0.11432608903317086], ["shoulder", 0.10965485631113274], ["suit", 0.10965485631113274], ["littler", 0.1020392675753477], ["closed", 0.07784206465965765], ["guess", 0.0723171689992348], ["left", 0.0723171689992348], ["great", 0.06088401047979636], ["better", 0.06003034754141162], ["door", 0.04888717238609897], ["looked", 0.03902588752444358]], "sentiment": ["\u201cNo,\u201d said Francine. \u201cI have to go shopping.

He looked me in the eye, and he said without a flicker of a smile, \u201cI\u2019d laugh like hell.\u201d\nTHE LAST TIME I heard him say that he had to laugh like hell was in Saigon, where I ran into him in a bar. He told me that he had just been awarded a Silver Star, which made him my equal, since I already had one. He had been with a platoon from his company, which was planting mines on paths leading to a village believed to be sympathetic with the enemy, when a fire-fight broke out. So he called for air support, and the planes dropped napalm, which is jellied gasoline developed by Harvard University, on the village, killing Vietnamese of both sexes and all ages. Afterward, he was ordered to count the bodies, and to assume that they had all been enemies, so that the number of bodies could be in the news that day. That engagement was what he got the Silver Star for. \u201cI had to laugh like hell,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t crack a smile.\nHE WOULD HAVE wanted to laugh like hell if he had seen me on the roof of our embassy in Saigon with my pistol drawn. I had won my Silver Star for finding and personally killing 5 enemy soldiers who were hiding in a tunnel underground. Now I was on a rooftop, while regiments of the enemy were right out in the open, with no need to hide from anybody, taking possession without opposition of the streets below. There they were down there, in case I wanted to kill lots more of them. Pow! Pow! Pow!\nI was up there to keep Vietnamese who had been on our side from getting onto helicopters that were ferrying Americans only, civilian employees at the embassy and their dependents, to our Navy ships offshore. The enemy could have shot down the helicopters and come up and captured or killed us, if they had wanted. But all they had ever wanted from us was that we go home. They certainly captured or killed the Vietnamese I kept off the helicopter after the very last of the Americans, who was Lieutenant Colonel Eugene Debs Hartke, was out of there.\nTHE REST OF that day:\nThe helicopter carrying the last American to leave Vietnam joined a swarm of helicopters over the South China Sea, driven from their roosts on land and running out of gasoline. How was that for Natural History in the 20th Century: the sky filled with chattering, man-made pterodactyls, suddenly homeless, unable to swim a stroke, about to drown or starve to death.\nBelow us, deployed as far as the eye could see, was the most heavily armed armada in history, in no danger whatsoever from anyone. We could have all the deep blue sea we wanted, as far as the enemy was concerned. Enjoy! Enjoy!\nMy own helicopter was told by radio to hover with 2 others over a minesweeper, which had a landing platform for 1 pterodactyl, its own, which took off so ours could land. Down we came, and we got out, and sailors pushed our big, dumb, clumsy bird overboard. That process was repeated twice, and then the ship\u2019s own improbable creature claimed its roost again. I had a look inside it later on. It was loaded with electronic gear that could detect mines and submarines under the water, and incoming missiles and planes in the sky above.\nAnd then the Sun itself followed the last American helicopter to leave Saigon to the bottom of the deep blue sea.\nAt the age of 35, Eugene Debs Hartke was again as dissolute with respect to alcohol and marijuana and loose women as he had been during his last 2 years in high school. And he had lost all respect for himself and the leadership of his country, just as, 17 years earlier, he had lost all respect for himself and his father at the Cleveland, Ohio, Science Fair.", 0.12392401427189163], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["hurty", 0.1608670517512562], ["colonel", 0.13548333947609906], ["peckhams", 0.1191701455236266], ["asked", 0.10695251331154179], ["tea", 0.08593447672104941], ["obstacle", 0.08593447672104941], ["admirably", 0.08593447672104941], ["paintings", 0.08593447672104941], ["whereabouts", 0.08593447672104941], ["yawns", 0.08593447672104941], ["damaging", 0.08593447672104941], ["garlic", 0.08593447672104941], ["eddied", 0.08593447672104941], ["martini", 0.08593447672104941], ["cakes", 0.07574113583046198], ["reach", 0.07574113583046198], ["polo", 0.07574113583046198], ["prefer", 0.07574113583046198], ["excused", 0.07574113583046198], ["discussed", 0.07574113583046198], ["parties", 0.06977841365240074], ["meal", 0.06977841365240074], ["problems", 0.06977841365240074], ["level", 0.06977841365240074], ["glasses", 0.06977841365240074], ["cocktails", 0.06554779493987455], ["announced", 0.06554779493987455], ["oil", 0.06554779493987455], ["rub", 0.06554779493987455], ["fighting", 0.06554779493987455], ["mixed", 0.06554779493987455], ["local", 0.06226627212643029], ["drop", 0.0595850727618133], ["spot", 0.057318150999647745], ["restaurant", 0.057318150999647745], ["study", 0.057318150999647745], ["maid", 0.05362235058375207], ["leaving", 0.05362235058375207], ["surprise", 0.052072931235842855], ["covered", 0.052072931235842855], ["parking", 0.05067131094460278], ["price", 0.05067131094460278], ["peckham", 0.04939173187122587], ["large", 0.04939173187122587], ["interested", 0.04821463322896798], ["supper", 0.04611020905778161], ["rest", 0.04263390349801352], ["telling", 0.04187959034525542], ["inside", 0.04047797005401535], ["air", 0.03919839098063844], ["best", 0.03859806753181116], ["fine", 0.03543466489038549], ["making", 0.033649946405028615], ["town", 0.03244056260742609], ["sir", 0.03132312279892723], ["mind", 0.029954145989132944], ["place", 0.029314659048842662], ["talk", 0.029314659048842662], ["call", 0.027827951447793122], ["man", 0.014017577776611851]], "sentiment": ["At four, they asked a maid for tea, and got it\u2014with little cakes.

Cooping was police slang for sleeping on the job.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDwayne stayed in his vacant lot for a while. He played the radio. All the Midland City stations were asleep for the night, but Dwayne picked up a country music station in West Virginia, which offered him ten different kinds of flowering shrubs and five fruit trees for six dollars, C.O.D.\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d said Dwayne. He meant it. Almost all the messages which were sent and received in his country, even the telepathic ones, had to do with buying or selling some damn thing. They were like lullabies to Dwayne.\n5", 0.05731481481481481], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["hollered", 0.2235604478550538], ["pointed", 0.1589577897395563], ["nineteen", 0.11823375721181607], ["quivered", 0.11028543622799794], ["experts", 0.11028543622799794], ["solo", 0.11028543622799794], ["observers", 0.11028543622799794], ["separates", 0.11028543622799794], ["eighteen", 0.10657312323548314], ["poritsky", 0.09734470702311673], ["soldier", 0.09734470702311673], ["follow", 0.09488216554888804], ["boulder", 0.09488216554888804], ["showing", 0.09488216554888804], ["flew", 0.09488216554888804], ["beg", 0.09488216554888804], ["rest", 0.08742721585359628], ["pardon", 0.08587182981315106], ["belong", 0.08587182981315106], ["scouts", 0.08587182981315106], ["fast", 0.07947889486977815], ["heads", 0.07046855913404117], ["kick", 0.07046855913404117], ["thousands", 0.0670429884712132], ["hurt", 0.0670429884712132], ["hole", 0.061458223398304174], ["head", 0.06130336408016877], ["boys", 0.05911687860590804], ["laid", 0.05699887461025637], ["company", 0.05506528845493127], ["smoke", 0.04867235351155837], ["sir", 0.04605495271919428], ["turned", 0.04485345891318815], ["men", 0.03470327219106115], ["boy", 0.03258526819540949], ["going", 0.020439852498341272]], "sentiment": ["\u201cGet up!\u201d Poritsky hollered at me. \u201cThat\u2019s nineteen-eighteen!
