In that light, Anne saw a vision. Anne\u2019s vision was of a book. The name of the author was her own. In the book, Anne Lawson Heiler told the truth about the shallowness and cowardice and hypocrisy of the rich people in the city.\nShe thought of the first two lines in the book: \u201cThere was a depression on. Most of the people in the city were poor and heartbroken, but there was dancing at the Athletic Club.\u201d She felt much better. She went back to sleep again.\nJust about the time Anne went back to sleep, Stanley Karpinsky opened a window in his attic room. He took the apparatus from the table with the lion\u2019s-claw feet, and he dropped the apparatus out the window piece by piece. Then he dropped his books and his microscope and all the rest of his equipment. He took a long time doing it, and some of the things made quite a racket when they hit the street.\nSomebody finally called the police about a crazy man dropping things out of a window. When the police came, and they found out who it was that was dropping things, they didn\u2019t say anything to Karpinsky about it. They just cleaned up the mess in the street as best they could\u2014cleaned it up sheepishly.\nHenry slept until noon that day. And when he got up, he got out of the house before anyone knew he was awake. His mother, a sweet, sheltered person, heard his car start, heard his tires swish in gravel, and he was gone.\nHenry drove with elaborate caution, dramatizing every motion he made in controlling the car. He felt that he had a terribly important errand to run\u2014but he wasn\u2019t sure what the errand was. His driving, then, took on the importance of the nameless errand.\nHe arrived at Anne\u2019s house while she was eating breakfast. The attitude of the maid who let Henry in was that Anne was a pathetic invalid. This was hardly the case. Anne was eating with gusto, and was writing in a school notebook between bites.\nShe was writing her novel\u2014angrily.\nAnne\u2019s mother sat across the table from her, uneasily respecting the unfamiliar rites of creativity. The savagery of her daughter\u2019s pencil strokes offended her, frightened her. She knew what the writing was about. Anne had let her read some of it.\nAnne\u2019s mother was delighted to see Henry. She had always liked Henry\u2014and she was sure Henry would help her to change Anne\u2019s very bad mood. \u201cOh, Henry, dear,\u201d she said, \u201chave you heard the good news?
