"sentiment": ["Hal stopped in front of a French chateau on which workmen were putting finishing touches. He turned off the motor, rubbed the lamp, buzzed the buzzer, and said, \u201cJinni, give me a new house at 5644 North Meridian Street.\u201d\nMary said to Ella, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this. Don\u2019t answer him.\u201d\nElla got mad at Mary now. \u201cI\u2019m getting paid!\u201d Everything Ella said was in a dialect typical of a person of her race and class and degree of education back then. Now she groaned. She was going into labor.\nThey took Ella Rice to the city hospital, the only one that admitted black people. She had a healthy boy baby, and Hal paid for it.\nHal and Mary brought her and the baby back to their new house. The old house was on the market. And Mary, who couldn\u2019t have a baby herself, fixed up one of the seven bedrooms for mother and child, with cute furniture and wallpaper and toys the baby wasn\u2019t old enough to play with. Mother and child had their own bathroom.\nThe baby was christened in a black church, and Mary was there. Hal wasn\u2019t. He and Mary were hardly speaking. Ella named the baby Irwin, in honor of the people who were so good to her. His last name was the same as hers. He was Irwin Rice.\nMary had never loved Hal, but had managed to like him. It was a job. There weren\u2019t many ways for women to earn their own money back then, and she hadn\u2019t inherited anything, and wouldn\u2019t unless Hal died. Hal was no dumber than most men she\u2019d known. She certainly didn\u2019t want to be alone. They had a black yard man and a black laundress, and a white housemaid from Ireland, who lived in the mansion. Mary insisted on doing the cooking. Ella Rice offered to do it, at least for herself. But nobody except Mary was allowed to cook.\nShe hated the new house so much, and the gigantic car, which embarrassed her, that she couldn\u2019t even like Hal anymore. This was very tough on Hal, extremely tough, as you can well imagine. Not only was he not getting love, or what looked like love, from the woman he\u2019d married, but she was giving ten times more love than he\u2019d ever gotten, and nonstop, to a baby as black as the ace of spades!\nHal didn\u2019t tell anybody at the office about the situation at home, because it would have made him look like a weakling. The housemaid from Ireland treated him like a weakling, as though Mary were the real power, and crazy as a bedbug.\nElla Rice of course made her own bed, and kept her bedroom and bathroom very neat. Things didn\u2019t seem right to her, either, but what could she do? Ella nursed the baby, so its food was all taken care of. Ella didn\u2019t eat downstairs with the Irwins. Not even Mary considered that a possibility. Ella didn\u2019t eat with the servants in the kitchen, either.
