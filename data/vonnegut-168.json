didn\u2019t know a soul,\u201d I said. \u201cThere still wasn\u2019t heat in the house, and I was trying to keep us warm with fires in the three fireplaces\u2014like my pioneer ancestors. And Dorothy was finally trying to catch up on art, reading up on it, since she had resigned herself to being stuck with an artist. She had never seen me draw\u2014because not drawing and forgetting everything I knew about art, I thought, was the magic key to my becoming a serious painter.\n\u201cSo, sitting in front of a fire in the kitchen fireplace, with all the heat going up the flue instead of coming out in the room,\u201d I said, \u201cDorothy read in an art magazine what an Italian sculptor had said about the first Abstract Expressionist paintings ever to be shown in a major show in Europe\u2014at the Venice Biennale in 1950, the same year I had my reunion with Marilee.\u201d\n\u201cYou had a painting there?\u201d said Circe.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was just Gorky and Pollock and de Kooning. And this Italian sculptor, who was supposedly very important back then, but who is all but forgotten now, said this about what we thought we were up to: \u2018These Americans are very interesting. They dive into the water before they learn to swim.\u2019 He meant we couldn\u2019t draw.\n\u201cDorothy picked up on that right away. She wanted to hurt me as much as I had hurt her, so she said, \u2018So that\u2019s it! You guys all paint the way you do because you couldn\u2019t paint something real if you had to.\u2019\n\u201cI didn\u2019t rebut her with words. I snatched a green crayon Dorothy had been using to make a list of all the things inside and outside the house that had to be repaired, and I drew portraits on the kitchen wall of our two boys, who were asleep in front of the fireplace in the living room. I just did their heads\u2014life size. I didn\u2019t even go into the living room to look at them first. The wall was new Sheetrock which I had nailed over the cracked plaster. I hadn\u2019t got around to filing and taping the joints between the sheets yet, and covering the nailheads. I never would.\n\u201cDorothy was flabbergasted,\u201d I said to Circe. \u201cShe said to me: \u2018Why don\u2019t you do that all the time?\u2019 And I said to her, and this was the first time I ever said \u2018fuck\u2019 to her, no matter how angry we might have been with each other: \u2018It\u2019s just too fucking easy.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYou never did fill in the joints between the Sheet-rock?\u201d said Mrs. Berman.\n\u201cThat is certainly a woman\u2019s question,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd my manly answer is this one: \u2018No, I did not.\u2019\u201d", 0.11520482603815935], "title": "Bluebeard"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["bridge", 0.29028106934140224], ["tender", 0.21609232832199599], ["red", 0.1839637510831981], ["slim", 0.15783557972557974], ["mott", 0.15714107183105638], ["chorus", 0.12758330628672881], ["whereabouts", 0.08975032915036603], ["heeeeeeey", 0.08975032915036603], ["hisself", 0.08975032915036603], ["familiarly", 0.08975032915036603], ["started", 0.08810667946020895], ["days", 0.0845187557469759], ["stan", 0.07857053591552819], ["machinery", 0.07857053591552819], ["amazed", 0.07857053591552819], ["kind", 0.07835568359334012], ["touch", 0.072030776107332], ["noticed", 0.072030776107332], ["harry", 0.072030776107332], ["word", 0.06978461373098509], ["cross", 0.06379165314336441], ["crossing", 0.06379165314336441], ["scudder", 0.060850982872494165], ["ain", 0.05621094944585254], ["thought", 0.05462320633596137], ["times", 0.051074598943940695], ["ready", 0.049671189637656335], ["eddie", 0.049671189637656335], ["hello", 0.049671189637656335], ["stay", 0.04838017822356704], ["start", 0.04718488835011991], ["thinking", 0.046072100100330374], ["job", 0.039894805709102865], ["nice", 0.03849139640281851], ["hear", 0.03720038498872922], ["day", 0.03600509511528209], ["talk", 0.03385136297617688], ["heard", 0.032873546495266644], ["better", 0.03195163659462231], ["wasn", 0.027998048561832235], ["good", 0.019275363787994704]], "sentiment": ["\u201cBridge tender,\u201d said Red.\n\u201cWhereabouts?\u201d said Slim.\n\u201cThis bridge right here,\u201d said Red.\n\u201cHeeeeeeey\u2014you hear that?\u201d said Slim.

Mark is the first Vonnegut in America to be a healer, and only the second one to earn a doctor\u2019s degree of any sort. My brother Bernard, of course, has a doctor\u2019s degree in chemistry.\nAnd Conrad Aiken, the poet, the one time I met him, told me that a child will compete with its father in an area where the father is weak, in an area where the father mistakenly believes himself to be quite accomplished. Aiken himself did this, by his own account. His father was a Renaissance man, a surgeon, an athlete, something of a musician, something of a poet, and on and on. Aiken said that he himself became a poet because he realized that his father\u2019s poetry really wasn\u2019t very good.\nSo what am I, if I believe that, to make of myself as mirrored in my own children, who cheerfully compete in every area, including writing, in which I have ever dabbled while they were watching? I played chess a little, and now all of them can beat me at chess. I painted and drew some, and now Jim Adams and Mark Vonnegut and Edith Vonnegut and Nanette Vonnegut can all paint and draw circles around me. Desperately, this old man is going to have a one-man show of his drawings this fall, but they\u2019re no damn good.\nYes, and I carpentered some, so now Jim Adams and Kurt Adams and Steve Adams and Mark Vonnegut can all do cabinet work. And on and on.\nMark has written a first-rate book. Edith has not only written but illustrated a first-rate book.\nI noodled around some on the piano and the clarinet, so Steve Adams now composes his own music and performs with his guitar in cabarets, and Mark plays saxophone and a little piano in a jazz band composed entirely of physicians, and on and on.\nThis is terrible.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI find that I want to protect the privacy of my two daughters, and so will talk about them very little. Nanette and Edith are both gifted artists. Both have found the life of an artist a lonely one. Edith has determined that loneliness is not too high a price to pay.

They renew their options enthusiastically. We are now at the point where each renewal is money in addition to the original deal. Fred Zinnemann is said to be on the hook.\nI am presently scared stiff because my moldy old play Penelope, renamed Happy Birthday, Wanda June, is supposed to open at the de Lys on or around October 1. We have a lease on the theater from August 14 on, and will do our casting when the lease begins. I have spent the last six weeks rewriting it. It was in dreadful shape when I dug it out of mothballs, and may be in worse shape now. I am waiting for the opinion of our director, Gerry Freedman, who recently did Colette. The producer is Les Goldsmith, who impulsively optioned it over dinner at Don Farber\u2019s house. Don worked out the deal. Goldsmith remembered it vaguely from the days when he was story editor at Paramount.\nCat\u2019s Cradle ceases to be the property of Hilly sometime in August. A lot of people seem to want it, including Peter Fonda. Alan Arkin is coming up here in a week to say that he and the guy who produced Little Murders want to do Cat\u2019s Cradle next\u2014with Arkin writing and directing. Max and Ziegler will represent me on this, since Max has been watching out for the property from the beginning, since he went through so much shit negotiating and negotiating with Hilly.
