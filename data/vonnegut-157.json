One person in twelve today, incidentally, has the Captain\u2019s blue eyes and his curly golden hair. Sometimes I will joke with such a specimen, saying, \u201cGuten morgen, Herr von Kleist,\u201d or, \u201cWie geht\u2019s es Ihnen, Fr\u00e4ulein von Kleist?\u201d That\u2019s about all the German I have.\nIt is more than enough today.\nShould Mary Hepburn have saved her relationship with a lie? The question remains moot after all this time. They were never an ideal couple. They had been stuck with each other after Selena and Hisako paired off and raised Akiko, and the Kanka-bono women moved to the far side of the crater, preserving the purity of their Kanka-bono beliefs and attitudes and ways.\nOne of the Kanka-bonos\u2019 customs, incidentally, was to keep their names a secret from anyone who wasn\u2019t a Kanka-bono. I was privy to their secrets, though, just as I was privy to everybody else\u2019s secrets, and there seems no harm in my now revealing that the first to have a baby by the Captain was Sinka, and the second to have a baby was Lor, and the third to have a baby was Lira, and the fourth to have a baby was Dirno, and the fifth to have a baby was Nanno, and the sixth to have a baby was Keel.\nAfter Mary moved out on the Captain, and made a canopy and a feather bed of her own, she would say to Akiko that she was no lonelier then than she had been when she lived with the Captain. She had several specific complaints about the Captain, faults he might easily have remedied, if he himself had been at all interested in making their relationship viable.\n\u201cBoth people have to work at a relationship,\u201d she advised Akiko. \u201cIf just one works on it, you might as well forget about it. It\u2019s just no good, and whichever one does all the work winds up the way I did, feeling like some kind of fool all the time. I was really happily married one time, Akiko, and would have been really happily married twice, if Willard hadn\u2019t died\u2014so I know how it\u2019s supposed to work.\u201d\nShe enumerated the

his smile look brighter in daylight. He grinned now, and he appeared to have a mouthful of little Christmas tree lights.\nBut the brightest new light in the room by far was the bosom of Kilgore Trout\u2019s new evening shirt. Its brilliance twinkled and had depth. It might have been the top of a slumping, open sack of radioactive diamonds.\nBut then Trout hunched forward involuntarily, buckling the starched shirt bosom, forming it into a parabolic dish. This made a searchlight of the shirt. Its beam was aimed at Dwayne Hoover.\nThe sudden light roused Dwayne from his trance. He thought perhaps he had died. At any rate, something painless and supernatural was going on. Dwayne smiled trustingly at the holy light. He was ready for anything.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTrout had no explanation for the fantastic transformation of certain garments around the room. Like most science-fiction writers, he knew almost nothing about science. He had no more use for solid information than did Rabo Karabekian. So now he could only be flabbergasted.\nMy own shirt, being an old one which had been washed many times in a Chinese laundry which used ordinary soap, did not fluoresce.\nDwayne Hoover now lost himself in the bosom of Trout\u2019s shirt, just as he had earlier lost himself in twinkling beads of lemon oil. He remembered now a thing his stepfather had told him when he was only ten years old, which was this: Why there were no Niggers in Shepherdstown.\nThis was not a completely irrelevant recollection. Dwayne had, after all, been talking to Bonnie MacMahon, whose husband had lost so much money in a car wash in Shepherdstown.

I never was.\nFinkelstein was a tank gunner in Patton\u2019s Third Army. When he measured me for my suit, a suit I still own, he told me, his mouth full of pins, about how a track was blown off his tank by a boy with a rocket launcher two days before the war in Europe ended.\nSo they shot him before they realized that he was just a boy.\nAnd here is a surprise: when Finkelstein died of a stroke three years later, when we were all starting to do quite well financially, it turned out that he had been a secret painter all along!\nHis young widow Rachel, who looked a lot like Circe Berman, now that I think about it, gave him a one-man show in his shop before she closed it up forever. His stuff was unambitious but strong: as representational as he could make it, much like what his fellow war heroes Winston Churchill and Dwight David Eisenhower used to do.\nLike them, he enjoyed paint. Like them, he appreciated reality. That was the late painter Isadore Finkelstein.\nAfter we had been measured for suits we went back down to the tavern for more food and drink and talk, talk, talk, we were joined by a seemingly rich and distinguished gentleman, about sixty years old. I had never seen him before, and neither had any of the others, as nearly as I could tell.\n\u201cI hear you are painters,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you mind if I just sit here and listen in?\u201d He was between me and Pollock, and across the table from Kitchen.\n\u201cMost of us are painters,\u201d I said.

Madelaine would be watching the bus approach, looking down from the third-story apartment that had once been a ballroom. As excited as any high school boy in love, he pulled the signal cord, and looked up for her face in the glossy green ivy that grew around the gable. She wasn\u2019t there, and he supposed happily that she was mixing anniversary cocktails.\n\u201cLowell:\u201d said the note in the hall mirror. \u201cAm taking a prospect for the Finletter property to supper.

Madelaine had left in a hurry. He picked up the afternoon paper, which was spread over the floor along with a pastepot and scrap-book, and read tatters that Madelaine had left whole, items that had nothing to do with real estate.\nThere was a quick hiss in his pocket, like the sound of a perfunctory kiss or the opening of a can of vacuum-packed coffee.\nLowell thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the paper knife. The little stone at its midpoint had come out of its setting, leaving a round hole.\nLowell laid the knife on the cushion beside him, and searched his pocket for the missing bauble. When he found it, he was disappointed to discover that it wasn\u2019t a pearl at all, but a hollow hemisphere of what he supposed to be plastic.\nWhen he returned his attention to the knife, he was swept with a wave of revulsion. A black insect a quarter of an inch long was worming out through the hole. Then came another and another\u2014until there were six, huddled together in a pit in the cushion, a pit made a moment before by Lowell\u2019s elbow. The insects\u2019 movements were sluggish and clumsy, as though they were shaken and dazed. Now they seemed to fall asleep in their shallow refuge.\nLowell took a magazine from the coffee table, rolled it up, and prepared to smash the nasty little beasts before they could lay their eggs and infest Madelaine\u2019s apartment.\nIt was then he saw that the insects were three men and three women, perfectly proportioned, and clad in glistening black tights.", -0.010962962962962978], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["conditions", 0.08538547025772425], ["admired", 0.06629608001034602], ["girl", 0.06431045126442259], ["assholes", 0.05713330139052765], ["stability", 0.05713330139052765], ["encouraging", 0.05713330139052765], ["perfectibility", 0.05713330139052765], ["rituals", 0.05713330139052765], ["progress", 0.05713330139052765], ["upsetting", 0.05713330139052765], ["vivaciously", 0.05713330139052765], ["vivacity", 0.05713330139052765], ["benevolence", 0.05713330139052765], ["coherence", 0.05713330139052765], ["coherently", 0.05713330139052765], ["impeccable", 0.05713330139052765], ["germany", 0.055241324779884145], ["prayers", 0.04991301825969489], ["mortal", 0.04991301825969489], ["auschwitz", 0.04991301825969489], ["harmony", 0.04991301825969489], ["necessity", 0.04991301825969489], ["christians", 0.04991301825969489], ["virtue", 0.045689423383568184], ["13", 0.045689423383568184], ["reminded", 0.045689423383568184], ["improving", 0.045689423383568184], ["enchanting", 0.045689423383568184], ["businessman", 0.045689423383568184], ["fool", 0.042692735128862125], ["1900", 0.042692735128862125], ["powerful", 0.042692735128862125], ["feelings", 0.042692735128862125], ["prisoner", 0.042692735128862125], ["poisoning", 0.042692735128862125], ["magic", 0.040368323136005774], ["female", 0.040368323136005774], ["taste", 0.040368323136005774], ["daughters", 0.040368323136005774], ["laws", 0.040368323136005774], ["matters", 0.038469140252735415], ["enemies", 0.038469140252735415], ["mixed", 0.038469140252735415], ["manners", 0.038469140252735415], ["relations", 0.038469140252735415], ["thinker", 0.038469140252735415], ["silly", 0.038469140252735415], ["fighting", 0.038469140252735415], ["attractive", 0.036863404004534805], ["friend", 0.03590826703743943], ["hitler", 0.03547245199802936], ["political", 0.03547245199802936], ["wars", 0.03547245199802936], ["charming", 0.03547245199802936], ["father", 0.03450324035419917], ["nature", 0.034245545376608705], ["working", 0.034245545376608705], ["innocent", 0.03314804000517301], ["won", 0.03314804000517301], ["remain", 0.03215522563221129], ["clemens", 0.031248857121902653], ["heart", 0.031248857121902653], ["impossible", 0.031248857121902653], ["understood", 0.031248857121902653], ["spoke", 0.030415078916969977], ["ideas", 0.0282521688671966], ["social", 0.0282521688671966], ["war", 0.02795129598123171], ["born", 0.027620662389942072], ["pay", 0.027620662389942072], ["attention", 0.025419525997575333], ["white", 0.02493494250137853], ["planet", 0.02447190330793235], ["free", 0.02402857399106989], ["married", 0.023603344881483898], ["help", 0.023194795786137215], ["parents", 0.023194795786137215], ["german", 0.022057303161501885], ["second", 0.022057303161501885], ["wife", 0.019804979114943177], ["class", 0.018971200910010505], ["told", 0.01702759720604788], ["indianapolis", 0.01702759720604788], ["family", 0.015974512655304453], ["things", 0.015776093957693055], ["children", 0.015018184017251093], ["book", 0.014483878867380773], ["vonnegut", 0.012878142619180164], ["good", 0.009918723336847906]], "sentiment": ["When I was little, there was a female friend of my parents who was particularly admired for her vivacity and good taste and impeccable manners and so on.

boss, too. He had made such a financial success of Athena that his corporate superiors allowed him to be completely autonomous. They had contracted with the State to take care of prisoners for only 2 thirds as much money per capita as the State had spent when it owned the place. That was about as much as it would have cost to send a convict to medical school or Tarkington. By importing cheap, young, short-term, nonunion labor, and by getting supplies from the lowest bidders rather than from the Mafia and so on, Hiroshi Matsumoto had cut the per capita cost to less than half of what it used to be.\nHe didn\u2019t miss a trick. When I went to work for him, he had just bought a state-of-the-art crematorium for the prison. Before that, a Mafia-owned crematorium on the outskirts of Rochester, in back of the Meadowdale Cinema Complex, across the highway from the National Guard Armory, had had a monopoly on cremating Athena\u2019s unclaimed bodies.\nAfter the Japanese bought Athena, though, the Mob doubled their prices, using the AIDS epidemic as an excuse. They had to take extra precautions, they said. They wanted double even if the prison provided a doctor\u2019s certificate guaranteeing that a body was AIDS-free, and the cause of death, as anybody could see, was some sort of knife or garrote or blunt instrument.\nTHERE WASN\u2019T A Japanese manufacturer of crematoria, so Warden Matsumoto bought one from A. J. Topf und Sohn in Essen, Germany. This was the same outfit that had made the ovens for Auschwitz in its heyday.\nThe postwar Topf models all had state-of-the-art smoke scrubbers on their smokestacks, so people in Scipio, unlike the people living near Auschwitz, never knew that they had a busy corpse carbonizer in the neighborhood.\nWe could have been gassing and incinerating convicts over there around the clock, and who would know?\nWHO WOULD CARE?\nA WHILE BACK I mentioned that Lowell Chung\u2019s mother died of tetanus. I want to say before I forget that tetanus might have a real future in astronautics, since it becomes an extremely rugged spore when life becomes intolerable.\nI HAVEN\u2019T NOMINATED AIDS viruses as promising intergalactic rock jockeys, since, at their present state of development, they can\u2019t survive for long outside a living human body.\nConcerted efforts to kill them with new poisons, though, if only partially successful, could change all that.", 0.05911195286195286], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["shitbox", 0.0794129374584597], ["houses", 0.07887432721557557], ["lawn", 0.07887432721557557], ["wearing", 0.06990281383452909], ["driven", 0.06307621114877979], ["senior", 0.05993273603164263], ["prom", 0.05727496568979336], ["funeral", 0.05497270029971538], ["celia", 0.051953725633440195], ["carport", 0.045412570336752826], ["success", 0.045412570336752826], ["trailer", 0.045412570336752826], ["ounce", 0.045412570336752826], ["prodigal", 0.045412570336752826], ["fatted", 0.045412570336752826], ["calf", 0.045412570336752826], ["knackwurst", 0.045412570336752826], ["yacht", 0.045412570336752826], ["lot", 0.03957384157189551], ["weight", 0.03943716360778778], ["post", 0.03943716360778778], ["shrubbery", 0.03943716360778778], ["tuxedo", 0.03943716360778778], ["considerable", 0.03943716360778778], ["dancing", 0.03943716360778778], ["tight", 0.03943716360778778], ["going", 0.038783566643855016], ["kill", 0.03594177474478636], ["lantern", 0.03594177474478636], ["driveway", 0.03594177474478636], ["unlocked", 0.03594177474478636], ["convertible", 0.03594177474478636], ["cars", 0.03594177474478636], ["recipes", 0.03594177474478636], ["carrying", 0.03594177474478636], ["slippers", 0.03594177474478636], ["vacant", 0.03594177474478636], ["parked", 0.03346175687882274], ["skin", 0.03346175687882274], ["heaven", 0.03346175687882274], ["americans", 0.03346175687882274], ["barefoot", 0.03346175687882274], ["hadn", 0.032768316018566446], ["lucky", 0.031538105574389894], ["movie", 0.031538105574389894], ["fault", 0.031538105574389894], ["catch", 0.031538105574389894], ["calling", 0.029966368015821317], ["mercedes", 0.029966368015821317], ["suddenly", 0.029966368015821317], ["expensive", 0.029966368015821317], ["suit", 0.029966368015821317], ["felix", 0.029434943120377425], ["cooking", 0.02863748284489668], ["golden", 0.02863748284489668], ["scene", 0.02863748284489668], ["dress", 0.02863748284489668], ["shoes", 0.02748635014985769], ["rolls", 0.02748635014985769], ["royce", 0.02748635014985769], ["dressed", 0.0264709791528199], ["running", 0.0264709791528199], ["fifty", 0.02556269884542485], ["leave", 0.02556269884542485], ["longer", 0.02556269884542485], ["mother", 0.025353747100347317], ["lives", 0.02474105936435308], ["exactly", 0.023990961286856273], ["side", 0.022662076115931632], ["best", 0.022662076115931632], ["good", 0.022371831819158732], ["coming", 0.020988317370750964], ["bought", 0.019587292116459806], ["living", 0.019166687252930217], ["black", 0.018765652635388035], ["son", 0.018765652635388035], ["car", 0.018765652635388035], ["front", 0.01766364081202696], ["dead", 0.01766364081202696], ["hoover", 0.01766364081202696], ["half", 0.017325531215877984], ["door", 0.016384158009283223], ["night", 0.013611885387494757], ["heard", 0.01339901803757776], ["life", 0.010116496524493339], ["told", 0.009974002542155318], ["people", 0.008308560912578953], ["years", 0.007854735623911521], ["father", 0.00562704863984542]], "sentiment": ["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI think now about all the little shitbox houses I have driven by in my life, and that all Americans have driven by in their lives\u2014shitbox houses with very expensive cars in the driveway, and maybe even a yacht on a trailer, too. And suddenly there was Mother\u2019s and my little shitbox, with a new Mercedes under the carport, and a new Rolls-Royce convertible on the front lawn. That was where Felix first parked his car when he got home\u2014on the lawn. We were lucky he didn\u2019t take down the post lantern, and half the shrubbery, too.\nSo in he came, saying, \u201cThe prodigal son is home! Kill the fatted calf!\u201d and so on. Mother and I had known he was coming, but we hadn\u2019t known exactly when. We were all dressed up, and about to go out, and were going to leave the side door unlocked for him.\nI was wearing my best suit, which was as tight as the skin of a knackwurst. I had put on a lot of weight recently. It was the fault of my own good cooking. I had been trying out a lot of new recipes, with considerable success.

I had been too busy ever to find out what the Chinese had been after out there.\n\u201cDear Dr. Swain,\u201d it began\u2014\n\u201cI am an undistinguished person, a piano teacher, who is remarkable only for having been married to a very great physicist, to have had a beautiful son by him, and after his death, to have been visited by a delegation of very small Chinese, one of whom said his father had known you. His father\u2019s name was \u2018Fu Manchu.\u2019\n\u201cIt was the Chinese who told me about the astonishing discovery my husband, Dr. Felix Bauxite-13 von Peterswald, made just before he died. My son, who is incidentally a Daffodil-11, like yourself, and I have kept this discovery a secret ever since, because the light it throws on the situation of human beings in the Universe is very demoralizing, to say the least. It has to do with the true nature of what awaits us all after death. What awaits us, Dr. Swain, is tedious in the extreme.\n\u201cI can\u2019t bring myself to call it \u2018Heaven\u2019 or \u2018Our Just Reward,\u2019 or any of those sweet things. All I can call it is what my husband came to call it, and what you will call it, too, after you have investigated it, which is \u2018The Turkey Farm.\u2019\n\u201cIn short, Dr. Swain, my husband discovered a way to talk to dead people on The Turkey Farm. He never taught the technique to me or my son, or to anybody. But the Chinese, who apparently have spies everywhere, somehow found out about it. They came to study his journals and to see what was left of his apparatus.\n\u201cAfter they had figured it out, they were nice enough to explain to my son and me how we might do the gruesome trick, if we wished to. They themselves were disappointed with the discovery.
