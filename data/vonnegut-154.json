We were told by the lawyer to leave our shoes in the foyer. It was the custom of the house. I, of course, was already in my stocking feet.\nUbriaco asked if Leen was a Japanese, since the Japanese commonly took off their shoes indoors.\nThe lawyer assured him that Leen was a Caucasian, but that he had grown up in Fiji, where his parents ran a general store. As I would find out later, Leen\u2019s father was a Hungarian Jew, and his mother was a Greek Cypriot. His parents met when they were working on a Swedish cruise ship in the late twenties. They jumped ship in Fiji, and started the store.\nLeen himself looked like an idealized Plains Indian to me. He could have been a movie star. And he came out into the foyer in a striped silk dressing gown and black socks and garters. He still hoped to make it to his daughter\u2019s debut.\nBefore he introduced himself to us, he had to tell the lawyer an incredible piece of news. \u201cYou know what the son of a bitch is in prison for?\u201d he said. \u201cTreason! And we\u2019re supposed to get him out and give him a job. Treason! How do you get somebody out of jail who\u2019s committed treason? How do we give him even a lousy job without every patriot in the country raising hell?\u201d\nThe lawyer didn\u2019t know.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Leen, \u201cwhat the hell. Get me Roy Cohn again. I wish I were back in Nashville.\u201d\nThis last remark alluded to Leen\u2019s having been the leading publisher of country music in Nashville, Tennessee, before his little empire was swallowed up by RAMJAC. His old company, in fact, was the nucleus of the Down Home Records Division of RAMJAC.\nNow he looked us over and he shook his head in wonderment. We were a freakish crew. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have all been noticed by Mrs. Jack Graham. She didn\u2019t tell me where or when.

They came to his side of the crater for water only late at night, when he was usually sound asleep, just so they could avoid him. They would go on hating him that much right up to the end of his life, even though he was the father of all the children they loved so much.\nBut a month before Kamikaze was born, the Captain could not sleep on his and Mary\u2019s feather bed. His big brain made him itch and squirm with a scheme for digging down to the water supply from the top of the crater, and locating the leak, and thus gaining control of what nobody had any reason to complain about: the rate of flow of the spring.\nThis was an engineering project, incidentally, about as modest as the construction of the Great Pyramid of Khufu or the Panama Canal.\nSo the Captain got out of bed and went for a walk in the middle of the night. The moon was full and directly overhead. When he came to the spring, there were the six Kanka-bonos, patting the top of the water in the brimming basin as though it were a friendly animal, and sprinkling each other and so on. They were having so much fun, and they were especially happy because they were all going to have babies soon.\nThey stopped having fun as soon as they saw the Captain. They thought he was evil. But the Captain was also dismayed\u2014because he was naked. He hadn\u2019t expected to run into anybody. He had not bothered to put on his iguana-skin breechclout. So now, after ten years on Santa Rosalia, the Kanka-bonos were getting their first look at his genitalia. They had to laugh, and then they couldn\u2019t stop laughing.\nThe Captain retreated to his dwelling, where Mary was fast asleep. He dismissed the laughter as simple-minded.

sheriff replied, \u201cI\u2019d have to sit there for more than two million years. My old lady might wonder what\u2019s become of me.\u201d He was a lot smarter than Dwayne. He had jizzum on the Arthur C. Clarke, and Dwayne didn\u2019t. You had to have an I.Q. of over 115 to have your jizzum accepted. There were certain exceptions to this: if you were a good athlete or could play a musical instrument or paint pictures, but Dwayne didn\u2019t qualify in any of those departments, either. He had hoped that birdhouse-makers might be entitled to special consideration, but this turned out not to be the case. The Director of the New York Philharmonic, on the other hand, was entitled to contribute a whole quart, if he wanted to. He was sixty-eight years old. Dwayne was forty-two.\nThere was an old astronaut on the television now. He was saying that he sure wished he could go where his jizzum was going. But he would sit at home instead, with his memories and a glass of Tang. Tang used to be the official drink of the astronauts. It was a freeze-dried orangeade.\n\u201cMaybe you haven\u2019t got two million years,\u201d said Dwayne, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got at least five minutes. Sit thee doon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m here for\u2014\u201d said the sheriff, and he let his unhappiness show, \u201cis something I customarily do standing up.\u201d\nDwayne and Grace were sincerely puzzled. They didn\u2019t have the least idea what was coming next. Here is what it was: the sheriff handed each one of them a subpoena, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s my sad duty to inform you that your daughter, Wanda June, has accused you of ruining her when she was a child.\u201d\nDwayne and Grace were thunderstruck. They knew that Wanda June was twenty-one now, and entitled to sue, but they certainly hadn\u2019t expected her to do so. She was in New York City, and when they congratulated her about her birthday on the telephone, in fact, one of the things Grace said was, \u201cWell, you can sue us now, honeybunch, if you want to.\u201d Grace was so sure she and Dwayne had been good parents that she could laugh when she went on, \u201cIf you want to, you can send your rotten old parents off to jail.\u201d\nWanda June was an only child, incidentally. She had come close to having some siblings, but Grace had aborted them. Grace had taken three table lamps and a bathroom scale instead.\n\u201cWhat does she say we did wrong?\u201d Grace asked the sheriff.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a separate list of charges inside each of your subpoenas,\u201d he said. And he couldn\u2019t look his wretched old friends in the eye, so he looked at the television instead. A scientist there was explaining why Andromeda had been selected as a target. There were at least eighty-seven chronosynclastic infundibulae, time warps, between Earth and the Andromeda Galaxy. If the Arthur C.

His corpse had been shown to them as a warning, I suppose, against their making any plans for derring-do. That body was surely icing on the cake of terror, so to speak. The College President, after all, was dangling from spikes in the loft above.\nOne of the hostages said in a TV interview after he was liberated that he would never forget the sound of Tex Johnson\u2019s head bouncing on the steps as Tex was dragged up to the loft feet first. He tried to imitate the sound. He said, \u201cBloomp, bloomp, bloomp,\u201d the same sound a flat tire makes.\nWhat a planet!\nTHE HOSTAGES EXPRESSED pity for Tex, but none for Lyle Hooper, and none for all the other faculty members and Townies who were also dead. The locals were too insignificant for persons on their social level to think about. I don\u2019t fault them for this. I think they were being human.\nThe Vietnam War couldn\u2019t have gone on as long as it did, certainly, if it hadn\u2019t been human nature to regard persons I didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t care to know, even if they were in agony, as insignificant. A few human beings have struggled against this most natural of tendencies, and have expressed pity for unhappy strangers. But, as History shows, as History yells: \u201cThey have never been numerous!\u201d\nANOTHER FLAW IN the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance.\nAND THE WORST flaw is that we\u2019re just plain dumb. Admit it!\nYou think Auschwitz was intelligent?\nWHEN I TRIED to tell the hostages a little about their captors, about their childhoods and mental illnesses, and their not caring if they lived or died, and what prison was like, and so on, Jason Wilder actually closed his eyes and covered his ears. He was being theatrical rather than practical. He didn\u2019t cover his ears so well that he couldn\u2019t hear me.\nOthers shook their heads and indicated in other ways that such information was not only tiresome but offensive. It was as though we were in a thunderstorm, and I had begun lecturing on the circulation of electrical charges in clouds, and the formation of raindrops, and the paths chosen by lightning strokes, and what thunder was, and on and on.
