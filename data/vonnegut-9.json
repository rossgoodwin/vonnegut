to behave decently and honorably without any expectation of rewards or punishments in an afterlife.\u201d Kurt told me after one of our New York lunches that he really messed up while giving a eulogy for his friend Isaac Asimov, the noted science-fiction writer, who\u2019d preceded him as honorary president of the Humanist Society.\n\u201cI said I was sure that Isaac must be in heaven now,\u201d he said with a smoky cough and a laugh. \u201cI forgot.\u201d\nIf it turned out there was an afterlife, Kurt reserved places in it for people he loved. In his last novel, Timequake, he said he was sure his first wife, Jane, was in heaven, and so was Sam Lawrence, the publisher who saved him from \u201csmithereens.\u201d\nKurt never failed to show support for his writer friends. The year before he died, he came to a talk I gave at St. Bartholomew\u2019s Episcopal Church in New York about a book I had recently published, and afterward he took me to dinner. While he had a Manhattan, his customary predinner drink, and I had a glass of wine, two young men kept staring our way from another table. Finally one of them got up and came over to ask, \u201cAre you the real Kurt Vonnegut?\u201d Kurt said he was and immediately introduced me and told the stranger about my new book, urging him to read it, which the poor guy had no interest in at all. After Kurt politely answered some questions about himself and his work, he gave a smart hand salute of dismissal and the man thanked him, backed away, and returned to his table. It was typical Kurt, diverting attention from himself to try to promote the unknown book of a friend, responding to a stranger\u2019s well-meaning intrusion with grace, and taking leave of him with dignity, leaving both friend and fan well treated, living the commandment that he made his habit, to \u201cDo unto others as you would have others do unto you.\u201d\nHe wrote in Timequake: \u201cWhen I myself am dead, God forbid, I hope some wag will say about me, \u2018He\u2019s up in heaven now.\u2019 \u201d\nFor the record, let me say of Kurt Vonnegut: \u201cHe\u2019s up in heaven now.\u201d\nTHE FORTIES\nVonnegut graduated from Shortridge High School in 1940 and enrolled in Cornell University. Due to his family\u2019s financial troubles brought on by the Depression, he was told by his father and older brother not to waste time on \u201cfrivolous courses\u201d but to study practical subjects, such as physics, chemistry, and math. He continued the social and writing activities he had engaged in at Shortridge, joining the Delta Upsilon fraternity and writing for The Cornell Daily Sun, becoming a columnist and managing editor.\nHe was failing his courses (after a bout with pneumonia) when he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943 and was assigned to the ASTP (Army Specialized Training Program), which sent him to Carnegie Tech and the University of Tennessee for training in mechanical engineering, then assigned him to the 106th Infantry Division. While he was home on leave from Camp Atterbury, outside Indianapolis, before being sent overseas, his mother, Edith Leiber Vonnegut, committed suicide from an overdose of sleeping pills on May 14, the day after Mother\u2019s Day. \u201cIt is not known why my mother killed herself,\u201d Kurt wrote in a letter of \u201cbiographical stuff\u201d he sent to Professor Klinkowitz on December 11, 1976. \u201cShe never said anything about the awfulness of fighting against the homeland or anything like that. In fact, I don\u2019t recall my parents\u2019 ever having spoken of Germany as the homeland.\u2026 It was war itself that wrecked my mother, and not war against Germany. Also, she was taking an awful lot of barbiturates at a time when the side-effects were thought to be negligible.\u201d\nThere were other factors, as recounted by Kurt\u2019s \u201cUncle John\u201d Rauch in \u201cAn Account of the Ancestry of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., by an Ancient Friend of his Family\u201d (quoted by Kurt in Palm Sunday). Rauch, a Harvard graduate and Indianapolis lawyer (and not really Kurt\u2019s uncle but the husband of a first cousin), wrote that \u201cWith her other financial problems the prospect of losing her son in the impending holocaust made her cup of troubles overflow. She became despondent and morose. Wanting money desperately, she attempted to write short stories which she could sell, but it was a futile, hopeless venture; a tragic disillusion. She simply could not see daylight.\u201d", 0.0394851576994434], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["hocus", 0.15507051066460414], ["pocus", 0.15507051066460414], ["vonnegut", 0.11645556284062779], ["original", 0.06338939450454809], ["times", 0.058227781420313894], ["cleveland", 0.049977957142356234], ["moralist", 0.049977957142356234], ["unnerve", 0.049977957142356234], ["prestidigitation", 0.049977957142356234], ["brilliance", 0.049977957142356234], ["satiric", 0.049977957142356234], ["combining", 0.049977957142356234], ["keen", 0.049977957142356234], ["mcinerney", 0.049977957142356234], ["provocative", 0.049977957142356234], ["outrageous", 0.049977957142356234], ["realistic", 0.049977957142356234], ["clever", 0.049977957142356234], ["whoopee", 0.049977957142356234], ["topical", 0.049977957142356234], ["toothed", 0.049977957142356234], ["vintage", 0.049977957142356234], ["establishes", 0.049977957142356234], ["ample", 0.049977957142356234], ["delight", 0.049977957142356234], ["poignant", 0.049977957142356234], ["entertain", 0.049977957142356234], ["cushion", 0.049977957142356234], ["startling", 0.049977957142356234], ["prod", 0.049977957142356234], ["movers", 0.049977957142356234], ["amuse", 0.049977957142356234], ["jay", 0.049977957142356234], ["scold", 0.049977957142356234], ["terribly", 0.049977957142356234], ["funny", 0.04609760143542148], ["francisco", 0.04290502672847924], ["sharp", 0.04290502672847924], ["dealer", 0.04290502672847924], ["astonish", 0.04290502672847924], ["plenty", 0.04290502672847924], ["satirist", 0.04290502672847924], ["irving", 0.04290502672847924], ["atlanta", 0.04290502672847924], ["prime", 0.04290502672847924], ["observation", 0.04290502672847924], ["chronicle", 0.04290502672847924], ["plain", 0.038767627666151036], ["wit", 0.038767627666151036], ["voice", 0.038767627666151036], ["satire", 0.03583209631460225], ["literary", 0.03583209631460225], ["hilarious", 0.03583209631460225], ["journal", 0.03583209631460225], ["twain", 0.03583209631460225], ["witty", 0.03583209631460225], ["angeles", 0.03583209631460225], ["los", 0.03583209631460225], ["proof", 0.03583209631460225], ["laugh", 0.03355512130119195], ["san", 0.03355512130119195], ["wall", 0.03355512130119195], ["constitution", 0.03355512130119195], ["lucky", 0.03169469725227404], ["social", 0.03169469725227404], ["novels", 0.030121731131587733], ["luck", 0.028759165900725258], ["popular", 0.027557298189945834], ["heart", 0.026482190887314953], ["mark", 0.026482190887314953], ["true", 0.026482190887314953], ["kurt", 0.025509638032168783], ["novel", 0.02304880071771074], ["universe", 0.02304880071771074], ["john", 0.021067616896884644], ["best", 0.019409260473437964], ["fiction", 0.017983118204303688], ["place", 0.017983118204303688], ["time", 0.01744466392074206], ["york", 0.01713228546002766], ["good", 0.01341143736219185], ["american", 0.010475906010643066]], "sentiment": ["\u201cTerribly funny...

Hocus Pocus is ample proof that his literary prestidigitation can still amuse and delight.\u201d\n\u2014San Francisco Chronicle\n\u201cVonnegut is back, with plenty to say... Combining clever wit with keen social observation, Hocus Pocus re-establishes Mr. Vonnegut\u2019s place as the Mark Twain of our times.\u201d\n\u2014Atlanta Journal & Constitution\n\u201cVintage Vonnegut, witty, startling, satiric... off-the wall brilliance. Vonnegut is a true original. Hocus Pocus is not only poignant and provocative, it is outrageous and very funny indeed.

eat. Barnstable fishermen used to call them \"horse mackerel,\" and curse whenever they caught one. Still cursing, they would chop it up and throw it back into the bay as a warning to other horse mackerel. Out of courage or plain stupidity, the tuna did not go away, and now make possible a post-Labor Day festival called the Barnstable Tuna Derby. Sportsmen with reels as big as courthouse clocks come from all over the Eastern seaboard for the event, the villagers are always mystified as to what brought them. And nobody ever catches anything.\nAnother discovery that still lies in the future for the villagers to make and to learn to live with is that mussels can be eaten without causing instant death. Barnstable Harbor is in places clogged with them. They are never disturbed. One reason for their being ignored, perhaps, is that the harbor abounds in two other delicacies far simpler to prepare\u2014striped bass and clams. To get clams, one can scratch almost anywhere when the tide is out. To get bass, one follows the birds, looks for cone-shaped formations of them, casts his lure to the place where the cone points. Bass will be feeding there.\nAs for what else the future holds: Few Cape villages have much chance of coming though the present greedy, tasteless boom with their souls intact. H. L. Mencken once said something to the effect that \"Nobody ever went broke overestimating the vulgarity of the American people,\" and fortunes now being made out of the vulgarization of the Cape surely bear this out. The soul of Barnstable Village just might survive.\nFor one thing, it is not a hollow village, with everything for rent, with half of the houses empty in the winter. Most of the people live there all year round, and most of them aren\u2019t old, and most of them work\u2014as carpenters, salesmen, masons, architects, teachers, writers, and what have you. It is a classless society, a sometimes affectionate and sentimental one.\nAnd these full houses, often riddled by termites and dry rot, but good, probably, for a few hundred years more, have been built chockablock along Main Street since the end of the Civil War. Developers find very little room in which to work their pious depredations. There is a seeming vast green meadow to the west, but this is salt marsh, the bluish-brown glurp capped by a mat of salt hay. It was this natural hay, by the way, that tempted settlers down from Plymouth in 1639. The marsh, laced by deep creeks that can be explored by small boats, can never be built upon by anyone sane. It goes underwater at every moon tide, and is capable of supporting a man and his dog, and not much more.\nSpeculators and developers got very excited for a while about the possibility of improving Sandy Neck, the long, slender barrier of spectacular dunes that bounds the harbor on the north. There are grotesque forests of dead trees out there, trees suffocated by sand, then unburied again. And the outer beach, for all practical purposes infinite, puts the beach of Acapulco to shame. Surprisingly, too, fresh water can be had out there from quite shallow wells. But the local government, thank God, is buying up all of Sandy Neck but the tip, at the harbor mouth, and is making it a public park to be kept unimproved forever.\nThere is a tiny settlement on the tip of the neck, the tip that the government is not taking over. It is clustered around the abandoned lighthouse, a lighthouse that was once needed when there was water enough around to let big ships come and go. The bleached and tacky settlement can be reached only by boat or beach buggy. There is no electricity there, no telephone. It is a private resort. Less than a mile from Barnstable Village, the tip of the neck is where many villagers go when they need a vacation.\nAnd all of the anachronistic, mildly xenophobic, charming queernesses of Barnstable Village might entitle it to the epithet, \"Last Stronghold of the True Cape Codders,\" if it weren\u2019t for one thing: Hardly anyone in the village was born on Cape Cod. Just as petrified wood is formed by minerals slowly replacing organic materials, so has the present-day petrified Barnstable been formed by persons from Evanston and Louisville and Boston and Pittsburgh and God-only-knows-where-else, slowly replacing authentic rural Yankees.\nIf the real Cape Codders could rise from their churchyard graves, cast aside their beautifully lettered slate headstones, and attend a meeting of the Barnstable Village Civic Association, they would approve of the proceedings. Every proposal that has ever come before the organization has been hotly debated and voted down, except that a new siren be bought for the rescue truck. The siren goes bweep-bweep-bweep instead of rowrrr, and is guaranteed to be audible at a distance of three miles.\nThe library, incidentally, now has a new Britannica, and a new Americana, too, purchases it made effortlessly, since it has money coming out of its ears. But so far, the school marks of the children and the conversation of the adults have not conspicuously improved.", 0.07018278742676332], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["friedmann", 0.20535641798274468], ["bars", 0.1567084838140187], ["book", 0.11118965038262102], ["eagerness", 0.07835424190700935], ["tuvia", 0.07835424190700935], ["nationless", 0.07835424190700935], ["inclination", 0.07835424190700935], ["villainy", 0.07835424190700935], ["stenographic", 0.07835424190700935], ["accurate", 0.06845213932758155], ["facts", 0.06845213932758155], ["1961", 0.06845213932758155], ["expressed", 0.06845213932758155], ["archives", 0.06845213932758155], ["assistants", 0.06845213932758155], ["specialist", 0.06845213932758155], ["complete", 0.06845213932758155], ["director", 0.06845213932758155], ["add", 0.06845213932758155], ["nazi", 0.06474060310349869], ["birth", 0.06265978064032209], ["address", 0.06265978064032209], ["suspected", 0.06265978064032209], ["awaiting", 0.06265978064032209], ["reputation", 0.06265978064032209], ["typewriter", 0.06265978064032209], ["writings", 0.05855003674815377], ["fair", 0.05855003674815377], ["concern", 0.05855003674815377], ["service", 0.05855003674815377], ["jerusalem", 0.05536227172937935], ["eager", 0.05536227172937935], ["war", 0.05298435820462696], ["republic", 0.052757678060894285], ["criminal", 0.052757678060894285], ["documentation", 0.052757678060894285], ["jail", 0.052757678060894285], ["persons", 0.05055552549193345], ["account", 0.05055552549193345], ["criminals", 0.04864793416872598], ["haifa", 0.04864793416872598], ["institute", 0.04864793416872598], ["nice", 0.046965319373634795], ["care", 0.046965319373634795], ["year", 0.044098595152746924], ["interest", 0.044098595152746924], ["crimes", 0.041712108228987396], ["trial", 0.04065342291250566], ["israel", 0.04065342291250566], ["third", 0.04065342291250566], ["order", 0.03966781046269206], ["mine", 0.038745831589298195], ["written", 0.038745831589298195], ["free", 0.037063216794207], ["jr", 0.03629082791891735], ["write", 0.035558066570523766], ["person", 0.03486106422524617], ["howard", 0.030250015764345443], ["campbell", 0.02840413388605964], ["american", 0.023051370322610915], ["will", 0.022185304296661847], ["man", 0.014230865196550214]], "sentiment": ["THE THIRD \u2026\nMY NAME is Howard W.

He is so eager as to give me a typewriter, free stenographic service, and the use of research assistants, who will run down any facts I may need in order to make my account complete and accurate.\nI am behind bars.\nI am behind bars in a nice new jail in old Jerusalem.\nI am awaiting a fair trial for my war crimes by the Republic of Israel.", 0.0772005772005772], "title": "Mother Night"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["blah", 0.10195854501412893], ["cabinetmaking", 0.06797236334275263], ["detail", 0.06797236334275263], ["drunk", 0.05902852875488236], ["opened", 0.055547668766418534], ["year", 0.055028746919591705], ["teacher", 0.0500846941670121], ["peephole", 0.04954467015408616], ["undifferentiated", 0.04720542253715133], ["nothingness", 0.04720542253715133], ["rapscallion", 0.03398618167137631], ["ostensibly", 0.03398618167137631], ["pleased", 0.03398618167137631], ["lessons", 0.03398618167137631], ["laced", 0.03398618167137631], ["weekends", 0.03398618167137631], ["surroundings", 0.03398618167137631], ["darlings", 0.03398618167137631], ["sarsaparilla", 0.03398618167137631], ["racket", 0.03398618167137631], ["quack", 0.03398618167137631], ["opium", 0.03398618167137631], ["basis", 0.03398618167137631], ["unborn", 0.03398618167137631], ["discontinued", 0.03398618167137631], ["heir", 0.03398618167137631], ["root", 0.03398618167137631], ["evidence", 0.03398618167137631], ["1", 0.03398618167137631], ["flavored", 0.03398618167137631], ["rail", 0.03398618167137631], ["overnight", 0.03398618167137631], ["dyed", 0.03398618167137631], ["1850", 0.03398618167137631], ["pupil", 0.03398618167137631], ["cabinetmaker", 0.03398618167137631], ["drawing", 0.03398618167137631], ["gunther", 0.033920010702555736], ["earned", 0.02951426437744118], ["teaching", 0.02951426437744118], ["whorehouses", 0.02951426437744118], ["studios", 0.02951426437744118], ["visits", 0.02951426437744118], ["piled", 0.02951426437744118], ["grain", 0.02951426437744118], ["principally", 0.02951426437744118], ["cocaine", 0.02951426437744118], ["1982", 0.02951426437744118], ["poured", 0.02951426437744118], ["galleries", 0.02951426437744118], ["berlin", 0.02951426437744118], ["voices", 0.02951426437744118], ["studied", 0.02951426437744118], ["1892", 0.02951426437744118], ["louisville", 0.02951426437744118], ["fanciest", 0.02951426437744118], ["appealed", 0.02951426437744118], ["wisps", 0.02951426437744118], ["da", 0.026898360454162697], ["leonardo", 0.026898360454162697], ["concluded", 0.026898360454162697], ["absolutely", 0.026898360454162697], ["1932", 0.026898360454162697], ["joke", 0.026898360454162697], ["elmo", 0.026898360454162697], ["harmless", 0.026898360454162697], ["vinci", 0.026898360454162697], ["whatsoever", 0.026898360454162697], ["describe", 0.026898360454162697], ["rudolph", 0.026898360454162697], ["cleveland", 0.026898360454162697], ["indianapolis", 0.026898360454162697], ["managed", 0.02504234708350605], ["painters", 0.02504234708350605], ["remedy", 0.02504234708350605], ["cloves", 0.02504234708350605], ["wisp", 0.02504234708350605], ["alcohol", 0.02504234708350605], ["changed", 0.02504234708350605], ["waltz", 0.024523384891314247], ["innocent", 0.023602711268575664], ["watch", 0.023602711268575664], ["medicine", 0.023602711268575664], ["sweet", 0.023602711268575664], ["visit", 0.023602711268575664], ["saint", 0.023602711268575664], ["loft", 0.023602711268575664], ["native", 0.023602711268575664], ["life", 0.02271316639047537], ["mansion", 0.022426443160227568], ["shut", 0.022426443160227568], ["suddenly", 0.022426443160227568], ["built", 0.022426443160227568], ["paid", 0.021431922645213], ["germany", 0.021431922645213], ["caught", 0.020570429789570917], ["youth", 0.020570429789570917], ["began", 0.020570429789570917], ["otto", 0.020570429789570917], ["hired", 0.020570429789570917], ["sound", 0.019810539236949087], ["painting", 0.019810539236949087], ["purple", 0.019810539236949087], ["german", 0.019130793974640535], ["fifty", 0.019130793974640535], ["west", 0.019130793974640535], ["allowed", 0.019130793974640535], ["cincinnati", 0.018515889588806178], ["light", 0.01795452586629244], ["voice", 0.01795452586629244], ["middle", 0.01743812130065672], ["child", 0.016960005351277868], ["carriage", 0.016960005351277868], ["august", 0.01651489005136205], ["studio", 0.016098512495635788], ["art", 0.01570738590327169], ["ten", 0.015338621943013957], ["named", 0.015338621943013957], ["boy", 0.014989801160625083], ["fortune", 0.014043972294871046], ["midland", 0.013338731025368629], ["father", 0.012633631784943264], ["family", 0.012261692445657123], ["things", 0.012261692445657123], ["years", 0.011756765579015954], ["ohio", 0.011626595201700656], ["city", 0.01080053368025825], ["school", 0.010689937073671638], ["house", 0.009572055000935916], ["told", 0.007464414805742044], ["mother", 0.004743604296194014]], "sentiment": ["1\nTO THE AS-YET-UNBORN, to all innocent wisps of undifferentiated nothingness: Watch out for life.\nI have caught life. I have come down with life. I was a wisp of undifferentiated nothingness, and then a little peephole opened quite suddenly. Light and sound poured in. Voices began to describe me and my surroundings. Nothing they said could be appealed. They said I was a boy named Rudolph Waltz, and that was that. They said the year was 1932, and that was that. They said I was in Midland City, Ohio, and that was that.\nThey never shut up. Year after year they piled detail upon detail. They do it still. You know what they say now? They say the year is 1982, and that I am fifty years old.\nBlah blah blah.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMy father was Otto Waltz, whose peephole opened in 1892, and he was told, among other things, that he was the heir to a fortune earned principally by a quack medicine known as \u201cSaint Elmo\u2019s Remedy.\u201d It was grain alcohol dyed purple, flavored with cloves and sarsaparilla root, and laced with opium and cocaine. As the joke goes: It was absolutely harmless unless discontinued.\nHe, too, was a Midland City native. He was an only child, and his mother, on the basis of almost no evidence whatsoever, concluded that he could be another Leonardo da Vinci. She had a studio built for him on a loft of the carriage house behind the family mansion when he was only ten years old, and she hired a rapscallion German cabinetmaker, who had studied art in Berlin in his youth, to give Father drawing and painting lessons on weekends and after school.\nIt was a sweet racket for both teacher and pupil. The teacher\u2019s name was August Gunther, and his peephole must have opened in Germany around 1850. Teaching paid as well as cabinetmaking, and, unlike cabinetmaking, allowed him to be as drunk as he pleased.\nAfter Father\u2019s voice changed, moreover, Gunther could take him on overnight visits by rail to Indianapolis and Cincinnati and Louisville and Cleveland and so on, ostensibly to visit galleries and painters\u2019 studios. The two of them also managed to get drunk, and to become darlings of the fanciest whorehouses in the Middle West.", 0.03589181286549708], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "god-bless-you-dr-kevorkian":

bonding between a mother and an infant during the first year of life\u2014or, alternatively, the absentminded lack of bonding. She studied motherless babies in London, all kinds of mothering or lack of it in Uganda, and then here in the U.S. of A.\nShe concluded, with impressive scientific proofs, that infants need a secure attachment to a mother figure at the beginning of life, if they are to thrive. Otherwise, they will be forever anxious.\nI wanted her to talk some about nature versus nurture, and also about the mothering I myself had received when a neonate\u2014whether that might not go a long way toward explaining me.\nBut Dr. Ainsworth was bubbling over with excitement over how her theories were confirmed in Heaven. Never mind all the honors she\u2019d received from fellow psychologists on Earth. It turns out that there are nurseries and nursery schools and kindergartens in Heaven for people who died when they were babies. Volunteer surrogate mothers, or sometimes the babies\u2019 actual mothers, if they\u2019re dead, bond like crazy with the little souls. Cuddle, cuddle, cuddle. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Don\u2019t cry, little baby. Your mommy loves you. Bet you have to burp. I\u2019ll bet that\u2019s the trouble. There. Feel better? Time to go sleepy-bye. Goo, goo, goo.\nAnd the babies grow up to be angels. That\u2019s where angels come from!\nThis is Kurt Vonnegut, signing off in the lethal injection facility in Huntsville, Texas. Until the next time, goo goo goo and ta ta.\nthis morning, thanks to a controlled\nnear-death experience, I was lucky enough to meet, at the far end of the blue tunnel, a man named Salvatore Biagini. Last July 8th, Mr. Biagini, a retired construction worker, age seventy, suffered a fatal heart attack while rescuing his beloved schnauzer, Teddy, from an assault by an unrestrained pit bull named Chele, in Queens.\nThe pit bull, with no previous record of violence against man or beast, jumped a four-foot fence in order to have at Teddy. Mr. Biagini, an unarmed man with a history of heart trouble, grabbed him, allowing the schnauzer to run away. So the pit bull bit Mr. Biagini in several places and then Mr. Biagini\u2019s heart quit beating, never to beat again.\nI asked this heroic pet lover how it felt to have died for a schnauzer named Teddy. Salvador Biagini was philosophical. He said it sure as heck beat dying for absolutely nothing in the Viet Nam War.", 0.14176767676767676], "title": "God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian"}, "we-are-what-we-pretend-to-be": {"tfidf": [["wagon",

found Hope in the sunroom, her quasi-adult figure clad in denim trousers and a man\u2019s shirt. She was seated tailor-fashion on the broad sill of a bay window. When she looked up at him, he felt as though his bones would melt. Her face was angelic beneath a honey-colored blizzard of close-cropped curls. The thoughtful depths of her dark green eyes, and the radiant cast of her features, dispelled in an instant the image of Kitty that Haley had thought would be foremost in his thoughts for the rest of his life. \u201cWelcome to Ardennes Farm,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have another young person around. This place needs young ideas like nobody\u2019s business.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the farm had a name,\u201d said Haley.\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Hope wearily, \u201cit\u2019s in honor of a battle, just like everything else around here.\u201d\n\u201cAnnie said you were very pretty, and you are,\u201d said Haley, astonishing himself with his atypical gallantry, and with the sudden affection for Hope that surged within him.\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d said Hope, and Haley guessed that she hadn\u2019t heard him clearly, for her head was turned away from him, her gaze intent on what Haley perceived to be a horse-drawn wagon, which was making a fitful and noisy approach toward the house. \u201cLook at that idiot, that big, childish, old fool, Haley,\u201d she said irritably.\nAs the wagon drew nearer, Haley saw that it was not moving continuously but was making a quick series of starts and stops, and that the man at the reins was standing on the empty wagon bed, dancing an abbreviated jig, and shouting at the top of his lungs. \u201cGiddyap! by golly; whoa! by golly; giddyap! blast you; whoa! blast you . . .\u201d A pink froth wreathed the mouth corners of the stamping, rearing horses.\nHope jumped through the open window onto the lawn below and ran toward the wagon, waving her arms. She reached it when it was less than one hundred yards from where Haley stood squinting into the bright, level rays of the setting sun. He watched with admiration Hope\u2019s courage and vigor, and with melancholy reflections of his own deficiency in those manly qualities, as she scrambled onto the wagon, stamped on it with fury, and berated the man at the reins.\n\u201cWhat do you want to do, kill the poor horses with those awful bits?\u201d Haley heard her say.\n\u201cI\u2019m darn well going to have the most obedient pair of horses in the state; that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do,\u201d bellowed the driver. \u201cNow get back in the house and set the table or something!\u201d He was short and plump, something like Annie, Haley thought, and he wore a disheveled ten-gallon hat, whose limp brim fluttered in the wind from the south, occasionally slapping at his steel-rimmed spectacles as he argued. \u201cNow get! Go on and get! Giddyap! by golly.\u201d The wagon jolted forward ten feet. \u201cWhoa!\u201d The driver hauled back on the reins.\nHope dropped from the wagon, ran to the head of the frantic team, and unsnapped the reins from the bridles. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret that piece of high-handedness, young lady,\u201d threatened the driver, pink with anger.

to appear as solemn and absorbed as possible. \u201cWhat finally became of him?\u201d he asked soberly.\nThe General seemed satisfied that his story was carrying the proper impact. \u201cWhen World War II broke out, this man was immediately made an officer. Everybody expected him to win the war single-handed. But when the going got tough over there in France, he cracked up completely. It turned out he didn\u2019t know the first thing about leadership, and he couldn\u2019t even take care of himself, so he was sick all the time.\u201d The General lowered his voice. \u201cThe morale in his company was so bad, that all his men had thrown away their gas-masks rather than carry them on marches. The first thing you know, the Jerries dropped mustard gas shells all over them. Zip! One whole company wiped out! And I\u2019ll always say it was a library card that killed them. See my point?\u201d\n\u201cYessir, I think so. He was one-sided. Is that it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it in a nutshell,\u201d said the General, beaming. \u201cYou expressed it perfectly. That\u2019s why I brought my whole family out here to the farm to live after the war, to keep us all from getting soft, from getting one-sided. Now spruce up for supper. People with dirty fingernails don\u2019t get to eat around here.\u201d\nII.\nAt 2 a.m., Central Standard Time, as reckoned by the parlor mantle clock in the home of Brigadier General William Cooley, retired, a light beam left the burning Sun. At 2:08 it glanced from the lip of a Moon crater, and a second later died on Earth, in the staring eyes of Haley Brandon.\nHaley lay sleepless between cool sheets, his thin arms folded behind his head, his eyes fixed on the window through which the wistful moonlight streamed. He felt wholly a stranger. None of the old, seemingly sweetly reasonable patterns of the past now applied. He was not actively melancholy \u2014 it was too soon for that. Rather, he was like a settler on his first day in a foreign land, bemused by his initial contacts with unfamiliar customs; not yet ready to admit that it would be those customs instead of his own that would enable him to remain and prosper.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see to it that you earn your way as best you can \u2014 with good, old-fashioned work. Sounds harsh, maybe, but you\u2019ll thank us for it in later years. We\u2019ll put some meat on you, too,\u201d the General had said at supper. The sweat and sinew-worship that seemed to pervade life at Ardennes Farm was a great curiosity to Haley. Robust was the password. As a Manhattan cliffdweller, he had won the loyalty of his small circle of friends \u2014 most of them adults and fellow musicians \u2014 with the cleverness of his fingers on a piano keyboard, with his promise as a concert pianist. Now, he reflected, the emphasis had been changed to the cleanliness of his fingers, and to whether or not he could move a piano.\nHaley thought about the peculiar man into whose hands he had been delivered for guidance. The General, he knew from having heard his mother talk about him, was a competent manager, a brave soldier, and well off financially, though not given to exhibiting the last-named quality. He had taken over management of the old Cooley farmstead, run by tenants for nearly a generation, after his retirement from the Army. Haley remembered a few discussions between his mother and father as to the truth of his mother\u2019s contention that the General, \u201cdown deep,\u201d had a heart of gold. His mother had never been able to produce much evidence for the affirmative. His father, on the other hand, had always had dozens of incidents to recall, which seemed to back up his opinion that the General was a \u201cpompous, selfish old teddy bear with sawdust for brains.\u201d As he lay abed for his first night in his new home, Haley thought he liked the General. The man was gruff, certainly, but he always gave sound reasons for the things he did.\nHaley flexed his fingers and recalled the dream-like quality his music had given his life in the past; and a pleasurable shudder passed over him as he reminded himself that that part of his life would begin anew in thirty days \u2014 for the General had promised that he might go to Chicago to resume his studies then. That was all that really mattered, Haley decided. Knowing that that much of the future was assured, he decided that he could adjust to any of the new order\u2019s rigors, and get along with just about anyone.", 0.12214390742871756], "title": "Basic

daughter\u2019s crayons, a different color for each main character. One end of the wallpaper was the beginning of the story, and the other end was the end, and then there was all that middle part, which was the middle. And the blue line met the red line and then the yellow line, and the yellow line stopped because the character represented by the yellow line was dead. And so on. The destruction of Dresden was represented by a vertical band of orange cross-hatching, and all the lines that were still alive passed through it, came out the other side.\nThe end, where all the lines stopped, was a beetfield on the Elbe, outside of Halle. The rain was coming down. The war in Europe had been over for a couple of weeks. We were formed in ranks, with Russian soldiers guarding us\u2014Englishmen, Americans, Dutchmen, Belgians, Frenchmen, Canadians, South Africans, New Zealanders, Australians, thousands of us about to stop being prisoners of war.\nAnd on the other side of the field were thousands of Russians and Poles and Yugoslavians and so on guarded by American soldiers. An exchange was made there in the rain\u2014one for one. O\u2019Hare and I climbed into the back of an American truck with a lot of others. O\u2019Hare didn\u2019t have any souvenirs. Almost everybody else did. I had a ceremonial Luftwaffe saber, still do. The rabid little American I call Paul Lazzaro in this book had about a quart of diamonds and emeralds and rubies and so on. He had taken these from dead people in the cellars of Dresden. So it goes.\nAn idiotic Englishman, who had lost all his teeth somewhere, had his souvenir in a canvas bag. The bag was resting on my insteps. He would peek into the bag every now and then, and he would roll his eyes and swivel his scrawny neck, trying to catch people looking covetously at his bag. And he would bounce the bag on my insteps.\nI thought this bouncing was accidental. But I was mistaken. He had to show somebody what was in the bag, and he had decided he could trust me. He caught my eye, winked, opened the bag. There was a plaster model of the Eiffel Tower in there. It was painted gold. It had a clock in it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a smashin\u2019 thing,\u201d he said.\nAnd we were flown to a rest camp in France, where we were fed chocolate malted milkshakes and other rich foods until we were all covered with baby fat. Then we were sent home, and I married a pretty girl who was covered with baby fat, too.\nAnd we had babies.\nAnd they\u2019re all grown up now, and I\u2019m an old fart with his memories and his Pall Malls. My name is Yon Yonson, I work in Wisconsin, I work in a lumbermill there.\nSometimes I try to call up old girl friends on the telephone late at night, after my wife has gone to bed. \u201cOperator, I wonder if you could give me the number of a Mrs. So-and-So. I think she lives at such-and-such.\u201d", -0.008285056446821155], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["daddy", 0.20162873060868697], ["invitation",

And he is just as smart and just as right as your Daddy is. Both Daddies are smart, and both Daddies are right.\nOnly if they ever met each other they would get into a terrible argument, because they wouldn\u2019t agree on anything. Now, you can say that your Daddy is right and the other little child\u2019s Daddy is wrong, but the Universe is an awfully big place. There is room enough for an awful lot of people to be right about things and still not agree.\nThe reason both Daddies can be right and still get into terrible fights is because there are so many different ways of being right. There are places in the Universe, though, where each Daddy could finally catch on to what the other Daddy was talking about. These places are where all the different kinds of truths fit together as nicely as the parts in your Daddy\u2019s solar watch. We call these places chrono-synclastic infundibula.\nThe Solar System seems to be full of chrono-synclastic infundibula. There is one great big one we are sure of that likes to stay between Earth and Mars. We know about that one because an Earth man and his Earth dog ran right into it.\nYou might think it would be nice to go to a chrono-synclastic infundibulum and see all the different ways to be absolutely right, but it is a very dangerous thing to do. The poor man and his poor dog are scattered far and wide, not just through space, but through time, too.\nChrono (kroh-no) means time. Synclastic (sin-classtick) means curved toward the same side in all directions, like the skin of an orange. Infundibulum (in-fun-dib-u-lum) is what the ancient Romans like Julius Caesar and Nero called a funnel. If you don\u2019t know what a funnel is, get Mommy to show you one.\nThe key to the Alice-in-Wonderland door had come with the invitation. Malachi Constant slipped the key into his fur-lined trouser pocket and followed the one path that opened before him. He walked in deep shadow, but the flat rays of the sunset filled the treetops with a Maxfield Parrish light.\nConstant made small motions with his invitation as he proceeded, expecting to be challenged at every turn. The invitation\u2019s ink was violet. Mrs. Rumfoord was only thirty-four, but she wrote like an old woman\u2014in a kinky, barbed hand. She plainly detested Constant, whom she had never met. The spirit of the invitation was reluctant, to say the least, as though written on a soiled handkerchief.\n\"During my husband\u2019s last materialization,\" she had said in the invitation, \"he insisted that you be present for the next. I was unable to dissuade him from this, despite the many obvious drawbacks. He insists that he knows you well, having met you on Titan, which, I am given to understand, is a moon of the planet Saturn.\"", 0.06101686507936505], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "if-this-isnt-nice-what-is": {"tfidf": [["stingy", 0.09163005491922965], ["sonya", 0.09163005491922965], ["ya", 0.09163005491922965], ["younger", 0.09163005491922965], ["intolerably", 0.09163005491922965], ["acknowledgement", 0.09163005491922965], ["older", 0.09071605897030884], ["children", 0.08947364011897298], ["credit", 0.0760537137830511], ["pity", 0.06694213831994629], ["telephone", 0.04581502745961483], ["cuts", 0.04581502745961483], ["cares", 0.04581502745961483], ["difficult", 0.04581502745961483], ["loose", 0.04581502745961483], ["rhyme", 0.04581502745961483], ["doan", 0.04581502745961483], ["ado", 0.04581502745961483], ["begonia", 0.04581502745961483], ["exact", 0.04581502745961483], ["experiencing", 0.04581502745961483], ["lifetime", 0.04581502745961483], ["atheist", 0.04581502745961483], ["imaginatively", 0.04581502745961483], ["silly", 0.04581502745961483], ["going", 0.04398703556177319], ["pronounce", 0.03802685689152555], ["sisters", 0.03802685689152555], ["guess", 0.03802685689152555], ["tough", 0.03802685689152555], ["treat", 0.03802685689152555], ["methuselah", 0.03802685689152555], ["australian", 0.03802685689152555], ["conditions", 0.03802685689152555], ["eskimos", 0.03802685689152555], ["aborigines", 0.03802685689152555], ["complain", 0.03802685689152555], ["making", 0.03802685689152555], ["women", 0.03774476789005278], ["survived", 0.033471069159973145], ["shut", 0.033471069159973145], ["people", 0.032559894207106865], ["men", 0.03077499422030358], ["question", 0.03023868632343628], ["buy", 0.03023868632343628], ["generations", 0.03023868632343628], ["graduate", 0.027731455409793472], ["smart", 0.027731455409793472], ["brothers", 0.027731455409793472], ["members", 0.025682898591883867], ["wrong", 0.025682898591883867], ["thought", 0.025682898591883867], ["love", 0.02431022854722985], ["close", 0.02395086848146524], ["hold", 0.02395086848146524], ["hell", 0.01887238394502639], ["news", 0.01887238394502639], ["planet", 0.017894728023794597], ["better", 0.017894728023794597], ["young", 0.016995371757799804], ["day", 0.01538749711015179], ["long", 0.01466234518725773], ["life", 0.012731443424036842], ["time", 0.010584755370523254]], "sentiment": ["I\u2019ll telephone ya.\nI love you so much, Sonya,\nThat I am going to buy you a begonia.\nYou love me, too, doan ya, Sonya?\nSee\u2014you were trying to guess what the next rhyme was going to be.

Guayaquil was two degrees south of the equator, the imaginary bellyband of the planet after which the country itself was named. It was always very hot there, and humid, too, for the city was built in the doldrums\u2014on a springy marsh through which the mingled waters of several rivers draining the mountains flowed.\nThis seaport was several kilometers from the open sea. Rafts of vegetable matter often clogged the soupy waters, engulfing pilings and anchor lines.\nHuman beings had much bigger brains back then than they do today, and so they could be beguiled by mysteries. One such mystery in 1986 was how so many creatures which could not swim great distances had reached the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, an archipelago of volcanic peaks due west of Guayaquil\u2014separated from the mainland by one thousand kilometers of very deep water, very cold water fresh from the Antarctic. When human beings discovered those islands, there were already geckos and iguanas and rice rats and lava lizards and spiders and ants and beetles and grasshoppers and mites and ticks in residence, not to mention enormous land tortoises.", 0.08228260869565218], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["henri", 0.09447053012407511], ["relatives", 0.0582502215828755], ["terry",

"sentiment": ["We came to know each other long before her husband died when I persuaded her, and him, too, although this was her property, not his, to rent their unused potato barn to me for a studio. They had never been potato farmers, of course. They had simply bought land from a farmer next door, to the north, away from the beach, in order to keep it from being developed. With it had come the potato barn.\nEdith and I did not come to know each other well until after her husband died and my first wife, Dorothy, and our two sons, Terry and Henri, moved out on me. I sold our house, which was in the village of Springs, six miles north of here, and made Edith\u2019s barn not only my studio but my home.\nThat improbable dwelling, incidentally, is invisible from the main house, where I am writing now.\nEdith had no children by her first husband, and she was past childbearing when I transmogrified her from being Mrs. Richard Fairbanks, Jr., into being Mrs. Rabo Karabekian instead.\nSo we were a very tiny family indeed in this great big house, with its two tennis courts and swimming pool, and its carriage house and its potato barn\u2014and its three hundred yards of private beach on the open Atlantic Ocean.\nOne might think that my two sons, Terry and Henri Karabekian, whom I named in honor of my closest friend, the late Terry Kitchen, and the artist Terry and I most envied, Henri Matisse, might enjoy coming here with their families. Terry has two sons of his own now. Henri has a daughter.\nBut they do not speak to me.\n\u201cSo be it! So be it!\u201d I cry in this manicured wilderness. \u201cWho gives a damn!\u201d Excuse this outburst.\nDear Edith, like all great Earth Mothers, was a multitude. Even when there were only the two of us and the servants here, she filled this Victorian ark with love and merriment and hands-on domesticity. As privileged as she had been all her life, she cooked with the cook, gardened with the gardener, did all our food shopping, fed the pets and birds, and made personal friends of wild rabbits and squirrels and raccoons.\nBut we used to have a lot of parties, too, and guests who sometimes stayed for weeks\u2014her friends and relatives, mostly. I have already said how matters stood and stand with my own few blood relatives, alienated descendants all. As for my synthetic relatives in the Army: some were killed in the little battle in which I was taken prisoner, and which cost me one eye. Those who survived I have never seen or heard from since.

He lived with her in the back of a moving van that was mostly filled with her electronic brains. He had a cot and a hot plate and a three-legged stool and a table and a locker in the back of the van. And he had a doormat he put on the bare ground outside when he parked the van somewhere for the night. \u201cJenny and George,\u201d it said. It glowed in the dark.\nJenny and George went from appliance dealer to appliance dealer all over the United States and Canada. They would dance and sing and crack jokes until they\u2019d collected a good crowd in a store. Then they would make a strong sales pitch for all the GHA appliances standing around doing nothing.\nJenny and George had been at it since 1934. George was sixty-four years old when I got out of college and joined the company. When I heard about George\u2019s big paycheck and his free way of life and the way he made people laugh and buy appliances, why I guessed he was the happiest man in the company.\nBut I never got to see Jenny and George until I got transferred out to the Indianapolis offices. One morning out there we got a telegram saying Jenny and George were in our neck of the woods somewhere\u2014and would we please find them and tell George his ex-wife was very sick? She wasn\u2019t expected to live. She wanted to see him.\nI was very surprised to hear he\u2019d had a wife. But some of the older people in the office knew about her. George had only lived with her for six months\u2014and then he\u2019d hit the road with Jenny. His ex-wife\u2019s name was Nancy. Nancy had turned right around and married his best friend.\nI got the job of tracking Jenny and George down. The company never knew exactly where they were. George made his own schedule. The company gave him his head. They just kept rough track of him by his expense accounts and by rave letters they\u2019d get from distributors and dealers.\nAnd almost every rave letter told about some new stunt that Jenny\u2019d done, that Jenny\u2019d never been able to do before. George couldn\u2019t leave her alone. He tinkered with her every spare minute, as though his life depended on making Jenny as human as possible.\nI called our distributor for central Indiana, Hal Flourish. I asked him if he knew where Jenny and George were. He laughed to beat the band and said he sure did. Jenny and George were right in Indianapolis, he said. They were out at the Hoosier Appliance Mart. He told me Jenny and George had stopped early morning traffic by taking a walk down North Meridian Street.\n\u201cShe had on a new hat and a corsage and a yellow dress,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd George was all dolled up in his soup and fish and yellow spats and a cane. You would of died. And you know how he\u2019s got her fixed up now, so\u2019s he knows when her battery\u2019s running down?\u201d\n\u201cNossir,\u201d I said.", 0.16026431563016927], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["relatives", 0.1351153680337757], ["extended", 0.08545322456649132], ["indianapolis", 0.07836022289540638], ["claim", 0.07798977805969229], ["comforting", 0.07798977805969229], ["gentle", 0.07798977805969229], ["gracefully", 0.07798977805969229], ["prosperous", 0.07798977805969229], ["spite", 0.07798977805969229], ["donors", 0.07798977805969229], ["roam", 0.07798977805969229], ["sooner", 0.07798977805969229], ["obeyed", 0.07798977805969229], ["siblings", 0.07798977805969229], ["disorderliness", 0.07798977805969229], ["shoals", 0.06779643716910486], ["adventures", 0.06779643716910486], ["cultivated", 0.06779643716910486], ["genuine", 0.06779643716910486], ["skeptics", 0.06779643716910486], ["uncles", 0.06779643716910486], ["receivers", 0.06779643716910486], ["grandparents", 0.06779643716910486], ["wide", 0.06779643716910486], ["aunts", 0.06779643716910486], ["settle", 0.06779643716910486], ["religious", 0.06183371499104361], ["grown", 0.06183371499104361], ["belong", 0.06183371499104361], ["writers", 0.06183371499104361], ["amusing", 0.06183371499104361], ["brother", 0.059043177707492546], ["invariably", 0.057603096278517424], ["decency", 0.057603096278517424], ["allow", 0.057603096278517424], ["german", 0.057603096278517424], ["cousins", 0.054321573465073165], ["scientists", 0.054321573465073165], ["indiana", 0.054321573465073165], ["birth", 0.054321573465073165], ["appeared", 0.05164037410045619], ["lucky", 0.05164037410045619], ["minds", 0.05164037410045619], ["common", 0.05164037410045619], ["english", 0.05164037410045619], ["wonderful", 0.04937345233829062], ["bernard", 0.04412823257448573], ["sorts", 0.04272661228324566], ["artificial", 0.04026993456761087], ["nice", 0.04026993456761087], ["families", 0.04026993456761087], ["beings", 0.03918011144770319], ["spoke", 0.0381655103964245], ["human", 0.032533271392658235], ["love", 0.03125369231928132], ["young", 0.030076593677023436], ["family", 0.029521588853746273], ["children", 0.029521588853746273], ["parents", 0.027489966229028377], ["told", 0.021686228111323244], ["time", 0.01593819416004366]], "sentiment": ["But, because of the sorts of minds we were given at birth, and in spite of their disorderliness, Bernard and I belong to artificial extended families which allow us to claim relatives all over the world.\nHe is a brother to scientists everywhere.

returned to Harvard with his stunning wife, took his law degree. He went on to specialize in international law, dreamed of helping the United Nations in some way. He received a doctorate in that field, and was handed simultaneously the presidency of the new Rosewater Foundation. His duties, according to the charter, were exactly as flimsy or as formidable as he himself declared them to be.\nEliot chose to take the Foundation seriously. He bought a town house in New York, with a fountain in the foyer. He put a Bentley and a Jaguar in the garage. He hired a suite of offices in the Empire State Building. He had them painted lime, burnt-orange and oyster white. He proclaimed them the headquarters for all the beautiful, compassionate and scientific things he hoped to do.\nHe was a heavy drinker, but no one worried about it. No amount of booze seemed to make him drunk.\nFrom 1947 until 1953, the Rosewater Foundation spent fourteen million dollars. Eliot's benefactions covered the full eleemosynary spectrum from a birth control clinic in Detroit to an El Greco for Tampa, Florida. Rosewater dollars fought cancer and mental illness and race prejudice and police brutality and countless other miseries, encouraged college professors to look for truth, bought beauty at any price.\nIronically, one of the studies Eliot paid for had to do with alcoholism in San Diego. When the report was submitted, Eliot was too drunk to read it. Sylvia had to come down to his office to escort him home. A hundred people saw her trying to lead him across the sidewalk to a waiting cab. And Eliot recited for them a couplet he had spent all morning composing:\n\"Many, many good things have I bought! Many, many bad things have I fought!\"\nEliot stayed contritely sober for two days after that, then disappeared for a week. Among other things, he crashed a convention of science-fiction writers in a motel in Milford, Pennsylvania. Norman Mushari learned about this episode from a private detective's report that was in the files of McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee. Old McAllister had hired the detective to retrace Eliot's steps, to find out if he had done things that might later legally embarrass the Foundation.\nThe report contained Eliot's speech to the writers word-for-word. The meeting, including Eliot's drunken interruption, had been taken down on tape.\n\"I love you sons of bitches,\" Eliot said in Milford. \"You're all I read any more. You're the only ones who'll talk about the really terrific changes going on, the only ones crazy enough to know that life is a space voyage, and not a short one, either, but one that'll last for billions of years. You're the only ones with guts enough to really care about the future, who really notice what machines do to us, what wars do to us, what cities do to us, what big, simple ideas do to us, what tremendous misunderstandings, mistakes, accidents and catastrophes do to us. You're the only ones zany enough to agonize over time and distances without limit, over mysteries that will never die, over the fact that we are right now determining whether the space voyage for the next billion years or so is going to be Heaven or Hell.\"\nEliot admitted later on that science-fiction writers couldn't write for sour apples, but he declared that it didn't matter. He said they were poets just the same, since they were more sensitive to important changes than anybody who was writing well. \"The hell with the talented sparrowfarts who write delicately of one small piece of one mere lifetime, when the issues are galaxies, eons, and trillions of souls yet to be born.\"", 0.06689242656984594], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf":

"sentiment": ["Other people found it beautiful. He was a much-beloved man in the city, with wonderfully talented hands. He was invariably courteous and innocent. To him all craftsmen were saints, no matter how mean or stupid they might really be.\nUncle Alex, by the way, could do nothing with his hands. Neither could my mother. She could not even cook a breakfast or sew on a button.\nPowers Hapgood could mine coal. That\u2019s what he did after he graduated from Harvard, when his classmates were taking jobs in family businesses and brokerages and banks and so on: He mined coal. He believed that a true friend of the working people should be a worker himself\u2014and a good one, too.\nSo I have to say that my father, when I got to know him, when I myself was something like an adult, was a good man in full retreat from life. My mother had already surrendered and vanished from our table of organization. So an air of defeat has always been a companion of mine. So I have always been enchanted by brave veterans like Powers Hapgood, and some others, who were still eager for information of what was really going on, who were still full of ideas of how victory might yet be snatched from the jaws of defeat. \u201cIf I am going to go on living,\u201d I have thought, \u201cI had better follow them.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI tried to write a story about a reunion between my father and myself in heaven one time. An early draft of this book in fact began that way. I hoped in the story to become a really good friend of his. But the story turned out perversely, as stories about real people we have known often do. It seemed that in heaven people could be any age they liked, just so long as they had experienced that age on Earth. Thus, John D. Rockefeller, for example, the founder of Standard Oil, could be any age up to ninety-eight. King Tut could be any age up to nineteen, and so on. As author of the story, I was dismayed that my father in heaven chose to be only nine years old.\nI myself had chosen to be forty-four\u2014respectable, but still quite sexy, too. My dismay with Father turned to embarrassment and anger. He was lemur-like as a nine-year-old, all eyes and hands. He had an endless supply of pencils and pads, and was forever tagging after me, drawing pictures of simply everything and insisting that I admire them when they were done. New acquaintances would sometimes ask me who that strange little boy was, and I would have to reply truthfully, since it was impossible to lie in heaven, \u201cIt\u2019s my father.\u201d\nBullies liked to torment him, since he was not like other children. He did not enjoy children\u2019s talk and children\u2019s games. Bullies would chase him and catch him and take off his pants and underpants and throw them down the mouth of hell. The mouth of hell looked like a sort of wishing well, but without a bucket and windlass. You could lean over its rim and hear ever so faintly the screams of Hitler and Nero and Salome and Judas and people like that far, far below. I could imagine Hitler, already experiencing maximum agony, periodically finding his head draped with my father\u2019s underpants.\nWhenever Father had his pants stolen, he would come running to me, purple with rage. As like as not, I had just made some new friends and was impressing them with my urbanity\u2014and there my father would be, bawling bloody murder and with his little pecker waving in the breeze.\nI complained to my mother about him, but she said she knew nothing about him, or about me, either, since she was only sixteen. So I was stuck with him, and all I could do was yell at him from time to time, \u201cFor the love of God, Father, won\u2019t you please grow up!\u201d", 0.13933343855218852], "title": "Jailbird"},

quizzically. \u201cThen you don\u2019t think it was a pigpen after all, eh?\u201d He didn\u2019t smile when he said it.\nThe door swung open, and two nondescript German laborers began dragging boxes of broken limestone from the shed. Each box, Peter saw, was marked with a number, and the laborers arranged them in order along a line Borgorov scratched in the dirt with his iron-shod heel.\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Borgorov. \u201cThat\u2019s the lot.\u201d He pointed with a blunt finger. \u201cOne, two, and three. Number one is from the deepest layer\u2014just inside the limestone\u2014and the rest were above it in the order of their numbers.\u201d He dusted his hands and sighed with satisfaction, as though he himself had moved the boxes. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll leave you to work.\u201d He snapped his fingers, and the soldier marched the two Germans down the mountainside. Borgorov followed, hopping twice to get in step.\nFeverishly, Peter and Josef dug into box number one, the one containing the oldest fossils, piling rock fragments on the ground. Each built a white cairn, sat beside it, tailor-fashion, and happily began to sort. The dismal talk of the night before, Peter\u2019s fall from political grace, the damp cold, the breakfast of tepid barley mush and cold tea\u2014all were forgotten. For the moment, their consciousnesses were reduced to the lowest common denominator of scientists everywhere\u2014overwhelming curiosity, blind and deaf to everything but the facts that could satisfy it.\nSome sort of catastrophe had apparently caught the big, pincerless ants in their life routine, leaving them to be locked in rock just as they were until Borgorov\u2019s diggers broke into their tomb millions of years later. Josef and Peter now stared incredulously at evidence that ants had once lived as individuals\u2014individuals with a culture to rival that of the cocky new masters of Earth, men.\n\u201cAny luck?\u201d asked Peter.\n\u201cI\u2019ve found several more of our handsome, big ants,\u201d replied Josef. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be very sociable. They\u2019re always by themselves. The largest group is three. Have you broken any rocks open?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve just been examining the surfaces.\u201d Peter rolled over a rock the size of a good watermelon, and scanned its underside with his magnifying glass. \u201cWell, wait, here\u2019s something, maybe.\u201d He ran his finger over a dome-shaped projection of a hue slightly different than that of the stone. He tapped around it gently with a hammer, painstakingly jarring chips loose. The whole dome emerged at last, bigger than his fist, free and clean\u2014windows, doors, chimney, and all. \u201cJosef,\u201d said Peter. His voice cracked several times before he could finish the sentence. \u201cJosef\u2014they lived in houses.\u201d He stood, with the rock cradled in his arms, an unconscious act of reverence.\nJosef now peered over Peter\u2019s shoulder, breathing down his neck. \u201cA lovely house.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than ours,\u201d said Peter.", 0.02758761706130128], "title": "Petrified Ants"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["60", 0.14277749353611754], ["61", 0.14277749353611754], ["62", 0.14277749353611754], ["64", 0.14277749353611754], ["65", 0.14277749353611754], ["supporting", 0.14277749353611754], ["underprivileged", 0.14277749353611754], ["difference", 0.14277749353611754], ["tyranny", 0.14277749353611754], ["queasy", 0.14277749353611754], ["59", 0.14277749353611754], ["58", 0.14277749353611754], ["57", 0.14277749353611754], ["56", 0.14277749353611754], ["63", 0.1311927761615986], ["reverent", 0.1311927761615986], ["squirrel", 0.1311927761615986], ["cage", 0.1311927761615986], ["belts", 0.122973288377262], ["fasten", 0.122973288377262], ["scared", 0.111388571002743], ["peace", 0.111388571002743], ["nation", 0.10698426586482135], ["worth", 0.10316908321840641], ["seat", 0.09980385362822403], ["plenty", 0.09980385362822403], ["dream", 0.09980385362822403], ["corporal", 0.09679355318085756], ["free", 0.08929743133892924], ["hazel", 0.06841493109484947], ["wasn", 0.05647963964627865], ["time", 0.051975955526176267], ["lorenzo", 0.04466357340797054], ["san", 0.04160722713505145], ["good", 0.04039123815165729]], "sentiment": ["56 A SELF-SUPPORTING SQUIRREL CAGE\n57 THE QUEASY DREAM\n58 TYRANNY WITH A DIFFERENCE\n59 FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS\n60 AN UNDERPRIVILEGED NATION\n61 WHAT A CORPORAL WAS WORTH\n62 WHY HAZEL WASN\u2019T SCARED\n63 REVERENT AND FREE\n64 PEACE AND PLENTY\n65 A GOOD TIME TO COME TO SAN LORENZO", 0.4666666666666666], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "twobrzerotwob": {"tfidf": [["parents", 0.07964853532653558], ["triplets", 0.07775034352837173], ["three", 0.07100461378385738], ["father", 0.059261853545360725], ["child", 0.059261853545360725], ["volunteers", 0.059261853545360725], ["called", 0.047336409189238246], ["raised", 0.03982426766326779], ["frowzy", 0.03982426766326779], ["wretched", 0.03982426766326779], ["newborn", 0.03982426766326779], ["hoarsely", 0.03982426766326779], ["scrape", 0.03982426766326779], ["exclaiming", 0.03982426766326779], ["find", 0.03982426766326779], ["chuckle", 0.03982426766326779], ["legal", 0.03982426766326779], ["phoned", 0.03982426766326779], ["survive", 0.03982426766326779], ["today", 0.03982426766326779], ["sitting", 0.03982426766326779], ["singles", 0.03982426766326779], ["appointments", 0.03982426766326779], ["eyed", 0.03982426766326779], ["volunteer", 0.03982426766326779], ["implications", 0.03982426766326779], ["red", 0.03982426766326779], ["wehling", 0.036976979966022006], ["edward", 0.029630926772680363], ["wall", 0.029630926772680363], ["heard", 0.029630926772680363], ["fine", 0.029630926772680363], ["spot", 0.029630926772680363], ["jr", 0.029630926772680363], ["hand", 0.029630926772680363], ["invisible", 0.029630926772680363], ["law", 0.029630926772680363], ["looked", 0.029630926772680363], ["mother", 0.029630926772680363], ["left", 0.029630926772680363], ["dr", 0.027732734974516508], ["hitz", 0.027732734974516508], ["die", 0.023668204594619123], ["waiting", 0.019437585882092934], ["born", 0.019437585882092934], ["live", 0.016156063068648672], ["going", 0.016156063068648672], ["leora", 0.013474863704031692], ["duncan", 0.013474863704031692], ["man", 0.013474863704031692], ["happy", 0.011207941941866128]], "sentiment": ["\"Triplets!\" she said.

["Paul wished he had gone to the front, and heard the senseless tumult and thunder, and seen the wounded and dead, and maybe got a piece of shrapnel through his leg. Maybe he\u2019d be able to understand then how good everything now was by comparison, to see what seemed so clear to others\u2014that what he was doing, had done, and would do as a manager and engineer was vital, above reproach, and had, in fact, brought on a golden age. Of late, his job, the system, and organizational politics had left him variously annoyed, bored, or queasy.\nHe stood in the old part of Building 58, which was now filled with welding machines and a bank of insulation braiders. It soothed him to look up at the wooden rafters, uneven with ancient adze marks beneath flaking calcimine, and at the dull walls of brick soft enough for men\u2014God knows how long ago\u2014to carve their initials in: \u201cKTM,\u201d \u201cDG,\u201d \u201cGP,\u201d \u201cBDH,\u201d \u201cHB,\u201d \u201cNNS.\u201d Paul imagined for a moment\u2014as he often imagined on visits to Building 58\u2014that he was Edison, standing on the threshold of a solitary brick building on the banks of the Iroquois, with the upstate winter slashing through the broomcorn outside. The rafters still bore the marks of what Edison had done with the lonely brick barn: bolt holes showed where overhead shafts had once carried power to a forest of belts, and the wood-block floor was black with the oil and scarred by the feet of the crude machines the belts had spun.\nOn his office wall, Paul had a picture of the shop as it had been in the beginning. All of the employees, most of them recruited from surrounding farms, had stood shoulder to shoulder amid the crude apparatus for the photograph, almost fierce with dignity and pride, ridiculous in stiff collars and derbies. The photographer had apparently been accustomed to taking pictures of athletic teams and fraternal organizations, for the picture had the atmosphere, after the fashion of the day, of both. In each face was a defiant promise of physical strength, and at the same time, there was the attitude of a secret order, above and apart from society by virtue of participating in important and moving rites the laity could only guess about\u2014and guess wrong. The pride in strength and important mystery showed no less in the eyes of the sweepers than in those of the machinists and inspectors, and in those of the foreman, who alone was without a lunchbox.\nA buzzer sounded, and Paul stepped to one side of the aisle as the sweeping machine rattled by on its rails, whooshing up a cloud of dust with spinning brooms, and sucking up the cloud with a voracious snout. The cat in Paul\u2019s arms clawed up threads from his suit and hissed at the machine.\nPaul\u2019s eyes began to nag him with a prickling sensation, and he realized that he\u2019d been gazing into the glare and sputter of the welding machines without protecting his eyes. He clipped dark glasses over his spectacles, and strode through the antiseptic smell of ozone toward lathe group three, which was in the center of the building, in the new part.\nHe paused for a moment by the last welding-machine group, and wished Edison could be with him to see it. The old man would have been enchanted. Two steel plates were stripped from a pile, sent rattling down a chute; were seized by mechanical hands and thrust under the welding machine. The welding heads dropped, sputtered, and rose. A battery of electric eyes balefully studied the union of the two plates, signaled a meter in Katharine\u2019s office that all was well with welding-machine group five in Building 58, and the welded plates skittered down another chute into the jaws of the punch-press group in the basement. Every seventeen seconds, each of the twelve machines in the group completed the cycle.\nLooking the length of Building 58, Paul had the impression of a great gymnasium, where countless squads practiced precision calisthenics\u2014bobbing, spinning, leaping, thrusting, waving\u2026. This much of the new era Paul loved: the machines themselves were entertaining and delightful.\nCursorily, he opened the control box for the welding-machine group, and saw that the machines were set to run for three more days. After that, they would shut down automatically until Paul received new orders from headquarters and relayed them to Doctor Lawson Shepherd, who was second-in-command and responsible for Buildings 53 through 71. Shepherd, who was sick today, would then set the controls for a new batch of refrigerator backs\u2014however many backs EPICAC, a computing machine in Carlsbad Caverns, felt the economy could absorb.\nPaul, calming the anxious cat with his long, slender fingers, wondered indifferently if Shepherd really was sick. Probably not. More likely, he was seeing important people, trying to get transferred out from under Paul.\nShepherd, Paul, and Edward Finnerty had all come to Ilium together as youngsters. Now Finnerty had moved on to bigger things in Washington; Paul had been given the highest job in Ilium; and Shepherd, sulky and carping, but efficient, had, in his own eyes, been humiliated by being named second-in-command to Paul. Transfers were an upper-echelon decision, and Paul hoped to God that Shepherd got one.", 0.04158231474407945], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["henry", 0.1019936107741379],

soft-spoken executrix, was locking life up safely until Spring came to claim it. At one with this sad, sweet allegory outside the kitchen window of her small home was Ellen Bowers, who, early in the morning, was preparing Tuesday breakfast for her husband, Henry. Henry was gasping and dancing and slapping himself in a cold shower on the other side of a thin wall.\nEllen was a fair and tiny woman, in her early thirties, plainly mercurial and bright, though dressed in a dowdy housecoat. In almost any event she would have loved life, but she loved it now with an overwhelming emotion that was like the throbbing amen of a church organ, for she could tell herself this morning that her husband, in addition to being good, would soon be rich and famous.\nShe hadn\u2019t expected it, had seldom dreamed of it, had been content with inexpensive possessions and small adventures of the spirit, like thinking about autumn, that cost nothing at all. Henry was not a moneymaker. That had been the understanding.\nHe was an easily satisfied tinker, a maker and mender who had a touch close to magic with materials and machines. But his miracles had all been small ones as he went about his job as a laboratory assistant at the Accousti-gem Corporation, a manufacturer of hearing aids. Henry was valued by his employers, but the price they paid for him was not great. A high price, Ellen and Henry had agreed amiably, probably wasn\u2019t called for, since being paid at all for puttering was an honor and a luxury of sorts. And that was that.\nOr that had seemed to be that, Ellen reflected, for on the kitchen table lay a small tin box, a wire, and an earphone, like a hearing aid, a creation, in its own modern way, as marvelous as Niagara Falls or the Sphinx. Henry had made it in secret during his lunch hours, and had brought it home the night before. Just before bedtime, Ellen had been inspired to give the box a name, an appealing combination of confidant and household pet\u2014Confido.\n\u201cWhat is it every person really wants, more than food almost?\u201d Henry had asked coyly, showing her Confido for the first time. He was a tall, rustic man, ordinarily as shy as a woods creature. But something had changed him, made him fiery and loud. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cHappiness, Henry?\u201d\n\u201cHappiness, certainly! But what\u2019s the key to happiness?\u201d\n\u201cReligion? Security, Henry?

The title refers to the kindling point of paper. That is how hot you have to get a book or a magazine before it bursts into flame. The leading male character makes his living burning printed matter. Nobody reads anymore. Many ordinary, rinky-dink homes like Ray\u2019s and mine have a room with floor-to-ceiling TV screens on all four walls, with one chair in the middle.\nThe actors and actresses on all four walls of TV are scripted to acknowledge whoever is sitting in the chair in the middle, even if nobody is sitting in the chair in the middle, as a friend or relative in the midst of things. The wife of the guy who burns up paper is unhappy. He can afford only three screens. His wife can\u2019t stand not knowing what\u2019s happening on the missing fourth screen, because the TV actors and actresses are the only people she loves, the only ones anywhere she gives a damn about.\nFahrenheit 451 was published before we and most of our neighbors in Osterville even owned TVs. Ray Bradbury himself may not have owned one. He still may not own one. To this day, Ray can\u2019t drive a car and hates to ride in airplanes.\nIn any case, Ray was sure as heck prescient. Just as people with dysfunctional kidneys are getting perfect ones from hospitals nowadays, Americans with dysfunctional social lives, like the woman in Ray\u2019s book, are getting perfect friends and relatives from their TV sets. And around the clock!\nRay missed the boat about how many screens would be required for a successful people-transplant. One lousy little Sony can do the job, night and day. All it takes besides that is actors and actresses, telling the news, selling stuff, in soap operas or whatever, who treat whoever is watching, even if nobody is watching, like family.\n\u201cHell is other people,\u201d said Jean-Paul Sartre. \u201cHell is other real people,\u201d is what he should have said.\nYou can\u2019t fight progress. The best you can do is ignore it, until it finally takes your livelihood and self-respect away. General Electric itself was made to feel like a buggy whip factory for a time, as Bell Labs and others cornered patents on transistors and their uses, while GE was still shunting electrons this way and that with vacuum tubes.\nToo big to fail, though, as I was not, GE recovered sufficiently to lay off thousands and poison the Hudson River with PCBs.\nBy 1953, Jane and I had three kids. So I taught English in a boarding school there on the Cape. Then I wrote ads for an industrial agency in Boston. I wrote a couple of paperback originals, The Sirens of Titan and Mother Night. They were never reviewed. I got for each of them what I used to get for a short story.\nI tried to sell some of the first Saab automobiles to come into this country. The doors opened into the wind. There was a roller-blind behind the front grille, which you could operate with a chain under the dashboard. That was to keep your engine warm in the wintertime. You had to mix oil with your gasoline every time you filled the tank of those early Saabs. If you ever forgot to do that, the engine would revert to the ore state. One engine I chipped away from a Saab chassis with a cold chisel and a sledge looked like a meteor!", 0.08779761904761904], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["flag",

We have to do something.\u201d\n\u201cI just thought I should mention that he doesn\u2019t seem depressed. It\u2019s very hard to say what Kurt is. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s well.\u201d\nThe difference between my fans and Kurt\u2019s is that my fans know they\u2019re mentally ill.\nKurt could pitch better than he could catch. It was routine for him to write and say provocative, not always kind things about people in the family. We learned to get over it. It was just Kurt. But when I mentioned in an article that Kurt, wanting to be a famous pessimist, might have envied Twain and Lincoln their dead children, he went ballistic.\n\u201cI was just trying to pull readers in. No one but you is going to take it even a little seriously.\u201d\n\u201cI know how jokes work.\u201d\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d\nClick and click, we hung up.\n\u201cIf I should die, God forbid.\u201d\nEvery few years he sent me a letter telling me what to do in the event of his death. Every time, except the last, the letter would be followed by a phone call, reassuring me that it wasn\u2019t a suicide note. The day before he sent me his last \u201cIf I should die\u201d letter, he finished the speech he was to deliver in Indiana to kick off the year of Kurt Vonnegut.
