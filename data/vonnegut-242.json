Franklin had forced him to it, just as he had forced him now, by apologizing for not being Karl Linberg.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to be like Karl,\u201d said Merle. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re the way you are.

He could never dream two million dollars\u2019 worth, could never dream anything worth the death of his father\u2019s dreams. Actor, newspaperman, social worker, sea captain\u2014Franklin was in no condition to give anyone hell.\n\u201cI\u2019d better get out to Aunt Margaret\u2019s,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou do that. And I\u2019ll hold off telling Ferguson or whatever-his-name-is anything until Monday.\u201d Merle seemed at peace.\nOn his way through the factory parking lot to his car, Franklin passed Rudy and Karl\u2019s new station wagon. His father had raved about it, and now Franklin took a good look at it\u2014just as he took good looks at all the things his father loved.\nThe station wagon was German, bright blue, with white-sidewall tires, its engine in the rear. It looked like a little bus\u2014no hood in front, a high, flat roof, sliding doors, and rows of square windows on the sides.\nThe interior was a masterpiece of Rudy and Karl\u2019s orderliness and cabinet work, of lockers and niches and racks. There was a place for everything, and everything was in its place\u2014guns, fishing tackle, cooking utensils, stove, ice chest, blankets, sleeping bags, lanterns, first-aid kit. There were even two niches, side by side, in which were strapped the cases of Karl\u2019s clarinet and Rudy\u2019s flute.\nLooking inside admiringly, Franklin had a curious association of thoughts. His thoughts of the station wagon were mixed with thoughts of a great ship that had been dug up in Egypt after thousands of years. The ship had been fitted out with every necessity for a trip to Paradise\u2014every necessity save the means of getting there.\n\u201cMistuh Waggonuh, suh!\u201d said a voice, and an engine raced.", 0.25775703463203464], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}}
