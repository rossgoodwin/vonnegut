Israel Edel gave me a rubber ice-cream cone with a squeaker in it\u2014a plaything for my little dog, who is a female Lhasa apso, a golden dustmop without a handle. I could never have a dog when I was young, because Alexander Hamilton McCone hated dogs. So this is the only dog I have ever known at all well\u2014and she sleeps with me. She snores. So did my wife.\nI have never bred her, but now, according to the veterinarian, Dr. Howard Padwee, she is experiencing a false pregnancy and believes the rubber ice-cream cone to be a puppy. She hides it in closets. She carries it up and down the stairs of my duplex. She is even secreting milk for it. She is getting shots to make her stop doing that.\nI observe how profoundly serious Nature has made her about a rubber ice-cream cone\u2014brown rubber cone, pink rubber ice cream. I have to wonder what equally ridiculous commitments to bits of trash I myself have made. Not that it matters at all. We are here for no purpose, unless we can invent one. Of that I am sure. The human condition in an exploding universe would not have been altered one iota if, rather than live as I have, I had done nothing but carry a rubber ice-cream cone from closet to closet for sixty years.\nClyde Carter and Leland Clewes chipped in on a far more expensive present, which is a chess-playing computer. It is about the size of a cigar box, but most of the space is taken up by a compartment for the playing pieces. The computer itself is not much bigger than a package of cigarettes. It is called \u201cBoris.\u201d Boris has a long narrow little window in which he announces his moves. He can even joke about the moves I make. \u201cReally?\u201d he will say; or, \u201cHave you played this game before?\u201d or, \u201cIs this a trap?\u201d or, \u201cSpot me a queen.\u201d\nThose are standard chess jokes. Alexander Hamilton McCone and I exchanged those same tired jokes endlessly when, for the sake of a Harvard education in my future, I agreed to be his chess-playing machine. If Boris had existed in those days, I probably would have gone to Western Reserve, and then become a tax. assessor or an office manager in a lumberyard, or an insurance salesman, or some such thing. Instead, I am the most disreputable Harvard graduate since Putzi H\u00e4nfstaengl, who was Hitler\u2019s favorite pianist.\nAt least I gave ten thousand dollars to Harvard before the lawyers came and took away all my money again.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt was time for me now at the party to respond to all the toasts that had been offered to me. I stood. I had not had a drop of alcohol.\n\u201cI am a recidivist,\u201d I said.

Where are you going? Are you crazy?\u201d\nHe brushed her hand away, smiled, and kept on going across the bridge into Homestead.\nThe bridge was blocked again by Reeks and Wrecks who were painting yellow lines to mark traffic lanes. Paul looked at his watch. They had ten more minutes until time for, as the expression went, knocking off work. Paul wondered if Bud Calhoun had thought up this project. Like most of the R&R projects, it was, to Paul at least, ironic. The fourlane bridge had, before the war, been jammed with the cars of workers going to and from the Ilium Works. Four lanes had been nothing like enough, and a driver stayed within his lane or got the side of his car ground off. Now, at any time of day, a driver could swerve from one side of the bridge to the other with perhaps one chance in ten thousand of hitting another vehicle.\nPaul came to a stop. Three men were painting, twelve were directing traffic, and another twelve were resting. Slowly, they opened a lane.\n\u201cHey, Mac, your headlamp\u2019s busted.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Paul.\nAnita slid across the seat to get close to him, and he saw that she was scared stiff. \u201cPaul\u2014this is awful. Take me home.\u201d\nPaul smiled patiently and drove into Homestead. The hydrant in front of the saloon by the end of the bridge was going again, and he had to park down the block. The same dirty boy was making paper boats for the amusement of the crowd. Leaning against a building and smoking nervously was a seedy old man who looked familiar to Paul. Then Paul realized that the man was Luke Lubbock, the indefatigable joiner, who was lost in the limbo of mufti, waiting for the next parade or meeting to start. With mixed emotions he looked around for Lasher and Finnerty, but saw no sign of them.

He simply wanted to give Felix a misty but recognizable ghost to look at, and to talk to, although the ghost would not be able to reply to him, if that might somehow comfort him.\nTo Felix, it seemed that our Haitian headwaiter was offering to make him insane, for only a lunatic would gladly meet a ghost.\nSo these two very different sorts of human beings, their hands thrust deep into their pockets, talked past each other in a mixture of English and Creole, while Ketchum and Captain Pefko and a couple of other soldiers looked on.\nHippolyte Paul was at last so deeply hurt that he turned his back on Felix and walked away.

They have a feeling of completion after making a deal. That\u2019s bad news creatively.
