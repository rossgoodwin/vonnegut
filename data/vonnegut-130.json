Delacorte/Dell was one of the few publishers at this time that were able to offer contracts for both hard and soft cover editions, which meant they were able to put up bigger advances than were customary in that era. This enabled Sam Lawrence, publishing through Delacorte/Dell, to build an impressive list of American fiction writers, eventually including Richard Yates, Tim O\u2019Brien, Jayne Ann Phillips, Tom McGuane, Frank O\u2019Connor, and others. Sam\u2019s advances put many novelists, like Kurt, \u201con their feet as writers.\u201d His faith that writers he believed in who had not yet become big moneymakers would eventually earn back their advances and make his company a profit was borne out\u2014most dramatically of all by Kurt Vonnegut.\nDear Sam:\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re glad. I can\u2019t imagine that you are as happy as I am. You\u2019re putting me on my feet as a writer. I\u2019ve been living off-balance ever since I started freelancing in 1950. We\u2019ll do some good books together.\nIn building your list, you should definitely take a look at the works of Jose Donoso, whose agent is Carl Brandt. Jose has been teaching out here with me for the past two years. He is a world citizen, nominally a Chilean. He speaks English beautifully, and why wouldn\u2019t he? He\u2019s a product of Princeton.\nI\u2019m reading his latest novel, This Sunday, in manuscript. It is smashing. Fuentes is terribly excited about it, and so is everybody else who has seen it. And Donoso is full of books to come.\nAsk Brandt for his form sheet. Knopf is publishing Donoso now. The marriage is weak.\nCheers,\nKurt\nApril 24, 1967", 0.26340579710144923], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["twinkle", 0.27210221110838395], ["planets", 0.18140147407225596], ["satellites", 0.18140147407225596], ["points", 0.18140147407225596], ["precisely", 0.15572935627373946], ["light", 0.15003417903414953], ["rarefied", 0.09070073703612798], ["represent", 0.09070073703612798], ["glints", 0.09070073703612798], ["twinkling", 0.09070073703612798], ["polaris", 0.09070073703612798], ["ling", 0.08936789445047819], ["ting", 0.08936789445047819], ["brave", 0.07786467813686973], ["obsolete", 0.07786467813686973], ["tonight", 0.07786467813686973], ["puke", 0.07786467813686973], ["interested", 0.07786467813686973], ["bb", 0.07786467813686973], ["picked", 0.07786467813686973], ["cross", 0.07035606502375559], ["promise", 0.07035606502375559], ["heavenly", 0.07035606502375559], ["excellent", 0.07035606502375559], ["apart", 0.07035606502375559], ["pick", 0.07035606502375559], ["sky", 0.0650286192376115], ["thousands", 0.0650286192376115], ["star", 0.06089633125031131], ["bodies", 0.06089633125031131], ["size", 0.05466536390547404], ["millions", 0.05466536390547404], ["stand", 0.05466536390547404], ["heart", 0.04806027235105306], ["feet", 0.04806027235105306], ["universe", 0.04182930500621579], ["idea", 0.04182930500621579], ["second", 0.034320691893101635], ["knew", 0.0334592101220851], ["human", 0.031847888325980844], ["matter", 0.031091925464494637], ["ten", 0.022388154552536576], ["years", 0.01487954143942242], ["trout", 0.009552095653278329]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI now ask this human being brave enough to stand next to me to pick two twinkling points of obsolete light in the sky above us.

That way there aren\u2019t such deep shadows in your eye sockets. I certainly don\u2019t want to lose those eyes. And could you imagine now that you are looking from a hilltop at sunset\u2014over a valley where a battle is going to take place the next day?\u201d\nSo he did that as best he could, and he couldn\u2019t talk without ruining everything. But, like a dentist, I was prefectly free to go on jabbering. \u201cGood! Wonderful! Perfect! Don\u2019t move anything!\u201d I said. And then I added almost absentmindedly as I laid the paint on: \u201cEvery branch of the service is claiming camouflage from the air as their specialty, even though it\u2019s obviously the business of the Engineers.\u201d\nAnd I said a little later: \u201cArtists are so naturally good at camouflage, I guess I\u2019m just the first of many to be recruited by the Corps of Engineers.\u201d\nDid such a sly and smarmy and Levantine seduction work? You be the judge:\nThe painting was unveiled at the General\u2019s retirement ceremonies. I had completed my basic training and been promoted to private first class. I was simply another soldier with an obsolescent Springfield rifle, standing in ranks before the bunting-draped scaffold which supported the painting on an easel, and from which the General spoke.\nHe lectured on aerial photography, and the clear mission of the Engineers to teach the other branches of the service about camouflage. He said that among the last orders he would ever give was one which called for all enlisted men with what he called \u201cartistic experiences\u201d to be assigned to a new camouflage unit under the command of, now get this: \u201cMaster Sergeant Rabo Karabekian. I hope I pronounced his name right.\u201d\nHe had, he had!\nI was a master sergeant at Fort Belvoir when I read of the deaths of Dan Gregory and Fred Jones in Egypt. There was no mention of Marilee. They had died as civilians, although in uniforms, and they both got respectful obituaries, since the United States was still a neutral nation in the war. The Italians weren\u2019t our enemies yet, and the British who killed Gregory and Fred weren\u2019t yet our allies. Gregory, I remember, was bid farewell in the papers as possibly the best-known American artist in history. Fred was sent on to Judgment Day as a World War One ace, which he wasn\u2019t, and an aviation pioneer.\nI, of course, wondered what had become of Marilee. She was still young and I presumed beautiful, and had a good chance of finding some man a lot richer than I was to look after her. I was certainly in no position to make her my own. Military pay was still very low even for a master sergeant.

"sentiment": ["The only big write-up I have so far received in my home town appeared in the October 1976 issue of Indianapolis Magazine, a publication of the Chamber of Commerce. It began like this:\n\u201cWhether they like his book or not (some don\u2019t), most of those who know Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., agree that he is a nice guy.\nIn Indianapolis his aunts, cousins and old friends call him Kay, and their memories of him are fond and lively. His Aunt, Irma Vonnegut Lindener, says warmly, \u201cHe\u2019s a dear, awfully nice,\u201d and her eyes light up with affection as she recounts thoughtful things he has done for the family over the years. He shared an enviable rapport with his uncle, Alex Vonnegut \u2026 though they were worlds apart in their convictions.\nThe tremendous gap between the old world gentility of Vonnegut\u2019s relatives and his own contemporary manner of living, thinking and writing has not dimmed the fondness that exists between them. Mrs. Lindener, an intellectual, articulate woman, admits that she has not read Breakfast of Champions, and doesn\u2019t intend to. She is also puzzled by some of his other books, but her pride in his achievement as a major novelist is not diminished by a difference in point of view \u2026\nMore offensive to my relatives than my books, even, I think, is the fact of my being divorced. In the history of my family in America, I am only the second member to have been divorced. When I returned to Indianapolis for the funeral of Uncle Alex, at the Flanner and Buchanan funeral home, a girl cousin I had once been very close to turned her back on me\u2014because I had not stuck with my first wife through thick and thin.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe only other Vonnegut to get divorced was my Uncle Walter\u2014again, a first cousin of my father. He, too, had the hubris to seek his fortune in the arts in New York City\u2014as an actor on the stage. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the then premiere novelist of Indianapolis, who was Booth Tarkington. I never met Mr. Tarkington, although I lived for a while only a block from his home on North Meridian Street, where he died in 1946. His use of black people for comic relief in some of his stories, no matter how kindly Mr. Tarkington\u2019s intentions, makes the stories sound somewhat dated today.\nBe that as it may, Mr. Tarkington was a first-rate playwright on top of everything else, which I am not, and he saw Uncle Walter in amateur productions in Indianapolis, and urged him to come here in the late 1920s, which Uncle Walter did.\nHe was an instant success as a supporting actor, appearing, for example, with Humphrey Bogart in The Petrified Forest. His wife Marjorie also did well as a supporting actress, and Uncle Walter and Aunt Marjorie and their two children, Walter, Jr., and Irma Ruth, were all in the cast of Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s only comedy, Ah, Wilderness!, starring George M. Cohan.

She carried a small suitcase and her knitting bag, into which she\u2019d swept the entire contents of her medicine cabinet.\nShe wasn\u2019t afraid, not even rattled, though she\u2019d never been on a train before, and had never seen anything remotely like the clouds of smoke and clanging busyness of Schenectady. She was numbed by duty and love, impressively tall and long-striding, leaning forward aggressively.\nThe cabstand was empty, but Annie told a redcap Hawkins\u2019s address, and he directed her to a bus that would take her there.\n\u201cYou just ask the bus driver where you should get off,\u201d said the redcap.", 0.07706696595585484], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["extended", 0.1277103136378332], ["families", 0.12036727694934238], ["politicians", 0.1165561518254742], ["athletes", 0.1165561518254742], ["ten", 0.10628120988063429], ["lawyers", 0.10132214785712375], ["writers", 0.09241082679980145], ["physicians", 0.09241082679980145], ["discuss", 0.09241082679980145], ["america", 0.09027545771200678], ["sorts", 0.0638551568189166], ["artificial", 0.06018363847467119], ["absorbing", 0.0582780759127371], ["sincerely", 0.0582780759127371], ["ideal", 0.0582780759127371], ["proportional", 0.0582780759127371], ["parliaments", 0.0582780759127371], ["passion", 0.0582780759127371], ["excluded", 0.0582780759127371], ["welfare", 0.0582780759127371], ["outsiders", 0.0582780759127371], ["reorganizing", 0.0582780759127371], ["ridiculous", 0.0582780759127371], ["expertly", 0.0582780759127371], ["housewives", 0.0582780759127371], ["incomprehensible", 0.0582780759127371], ["interrupted", 0.0582780759127371], ["losers", 0.0582780759127371], ["hypocrites", 0.0582780759127371], ["representation", 0.0582780759127371], ["creation", 0.050661073928561874], ["provide", 0.050661073928561874], ["utopian", 0.050661073928561874], ["interests", 0.050661073928561874], ["specialized", 0.050661073928561874], ["patients", 0.050661073928561874], ["numbers", 0.050661073928561874], ["description", 0.046205413399900724], ["mankind", 0.046205413399900724], ["sleep", 0.046205413399900724], ["children", 0.044120176748455975], ["frightened", 0.04304407194438665], ["smart", 0.04304407194438665], ["insane", 0.040591945006867865], ["thousands", 0.040591945006867865], ["apart", 0.040591945006867865], ["clear", 0.040591945006867865], ["paper", 0.038588411415725506], ["americans", 0.03689444790114025], ["scheme", 0.03689444790114025], ["fu", 0.03689444790114025], ["manchu", 0.03689444790114025], ["nurse", 0.03689444790114025], ["reading", 0.03689444790114025], ["written", 0.03542706996021143], ["bad", 0.03542706996021143], ["incidentally", 0.03413275088706436], ["felt", 0.03413275088706436], ["ago", 0.030091819237335594], ["speak", 0.028519282494031493], ["work", 0.028519282494031493], ["heads", 0.027810067976036208], ["head", 0.025921603614204786], ["times", 0.025921603614204786], ["eliza", 0.025764274648682483], ["gravity", 0.02431057642528308], ["young", 0.022474817253160372], ["family", 0.022060088374227987], ["long", 0.0205419527865267], ["people", 0.014043441948614578]], "sentiment": ["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe paper on gravity was incomprehensible to me.

He did not answer.\n13", 0.2531150793650793], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["bup", 0.24687867891299012], ["strelitz", 0.085795449498655], ["von", 0.085795449498655], ["arm", 0.06866851993091379], ["costume", 0.04937573578259802], ["shingles", 0.04937573578259802], ["robe", 0.04937573578259802], ["borrow", 0.04937573578259802], ["repulsed", 0.04937573578259802], ["feathers", 0.04937573578259802], ["superb", 0.04937573578259802], ["tuition", 0.04937573578259802], ["vesicles", 0.04937573578259802], ["wreaths", 0.04937573578259802], ["bathroom", 0.04937573578259802], ["seminal", 0.04937573578259802], ["obeying", 0.04937573578259802], ["slamming", 0.04937573578259802], ["pantomime", 0.04937573578259802], ["cartoon", 0.04937573578259802], ["cuffs", 0.0428977247493275], ["grotesque", 0.0428977247493275], ["signals", 0.0428977247493275], ["clad", 0.0428977247493275], ["allowance", 0.0428977247493275], ["saving", 0.0428977247493275], ["slipped", 0.0428977247493275], ["motor", 0.0428977247493275], ["angry", 0.0428977247493275], ["confident", 0.0428977247493275], ["bloated", 0.0428977247493275], ["karl", 0.0428977247493275], ["daring", 0.0428977247493275], ["sixties", 0.0428977247493275], ["serene", 0.0428977247493275], ["unmade", 0.0428977247493275], ["scholarship", 0.0428977247493275], ["door", 0.042756475797831726], ["belonging", 0.03910833121560634], ["oxford", 0.03910833121560634], ["fortune", 0.03910833121560634], ["adhesives", 0.03910833121560634], ["islands", 0.03910833121560634], ["repair", 0.03910833121560634], ["emptied", 0.03910833121560634], ["wardrobe", 0.03910833121560634], ["solomon", 0.03910833121560634], ["rally", 0.03910833121560634], ["brotherhood", 0.03910833121560634], ["abrasives", 0.03910833121560634], ["capitalist", 0.03910833121560634], ["continue", 0.03641971371605699], ["childhood", 0.03641971371605699], ["calm", 0.03641971371605699], ["marx", 0.03641971371605699], ["comrades", 0.03641971371605699], ["remained", 0.034334259965456894], ["graduate", 0.034334259965456894], ["collar", 0.032630320182335824], ["magic", 0.031189659623202567], ["international", 0.031189659623202567], ["paid", 0.031189659623202567], ["bank", 0.02994170268278647], ["opened", 0.02994170268278647], ["silent", 0.02994170268278647], ["sounds", 0.02884092664861466], ["soul", 0.02884092664861466], ["picture", 0.02884092664861466], ["early", 0.027856248932186377], ["appeared", 0.026965499588220726], ["bed", 0.026152309149065307], ["kenneth", 0.026152309149065307], ["workers", 0.025404246460527583], ["kathleen", 0.02525940366380678], ["mary", 0.024896448787973105], ["paper", 0.024066855398465217], ["whistler", 0.024066855398465217], ["wall", 0.023463691649515953], ["rest", 0.02289710639889507], ["brought", 0.022362915615344148], ["small", 0.021378237898915863], ["speak", 0.020487488554950212], ["full", 0.01967429811579479], ["looked", 0.018926235427257066], ["mccone", 0.018573522081622985], ["man", 0.018455072395898622], ["front", 0.017905681296743126], ["mother", 0.0175888443651947], ["money", 0.01698568061624544], ["hear", 0.01698568061624544], ["year", 0.01669809502122905], ["god", 0.01588490458207363], ["night", 0.014900226865645346], ["young", 0.013594040488307414], ["good", 0.010654850489219214]], "sentiment": ["I remained calm.

["THERE WERE PEOPLE on Earth at the time of the meeting, but they were just more hot slop for the germs to swim in. But they had extra-large brains, and some of them could talk. A few could even read and write! So the Elders focused in on them, and wondered if people\u2019s brains might not invent survival tests for germs which were truly horrible.\nThey saw in us a potential for chemical evils on a cosmic scale. Nor did we disappoint them.\nWHAT A STORY!\nIT SO HAPPENED, according to this story, that the legend of Adam and Eve was being written down for the first time. A woman was doing it. Until then, that charming bunkum had been passed from generation to generation by word of mouth.\nThe Elders let her write down most of the origin myth just the way she had heard it, the way everybody told it, until she got very close to the end. Then they took control of her brain and had her write down something which had never been part of the myth before.\nIt was a speech by God to Adam and Eve, supposedly. This was it, and life would become pure hell for microorganisms soon afterward: \u201cFill the Earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves on the Earth.\u201d\nCOUGH.\n26\nSO THE PEOPLE on Earth thought they had instructions from the Creator of the Universe Himself to wreck the joint. But they were going at it too slowly to satisfy the Elders, so the Elders put it into the people\u2019s heads that they themselves were the life forms that were supposed to spread out through the Universe. This was a preposterous idea, of course. In the words of the nameless author: \u201cHow could all that meat, needing so much food and water and oxygen, and with bowel movements so enormous, expect to survive a trip of any distance whatsoever through the limitless void of outer space? It was a miracle that such ravenous and cumbersome giants could make a roundtrip for a 6-pack to the nearest grocery store.\u201d\nThe Elders, incidentally, had given up on influencing the humanoids of Tralfamadore, who were right below where they were meeting. The Tralfamadorians had senses of humor and so knew themselves for the severely limited lunkers, not to say crazy lunkers, they really were. They were immune to the kilovolts of pride the Elders jazzed their brains with.

The press of the Western World called it the funniest book of the year, and reprinted passages that proved it. The Communist press called it the gloomiest book of the year, and devoted columns to the tale of the American billionaire who was trying to make direct contact with the Devil in order to increase his profits.\nDr. Tarbell was untroubled. \u201cWe are now at the point at which the physical sciences once were with respect to the structure of the atom,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cWe have some ideas that are little more than matters of faith. Perhaps they\u2019re laughable, but it\u2019s ignorant and unscientific to laugh until we\u2019ve had some time to experiment.\u201d\nLost among the pages and pages of nonsense in the Report were three hypotheses suggested by Dr. Tarbell:\nThat, since many cases of mental illness were cured by electric shock treatment, the Devil might find electricity unpleasant; that, since many mild cases of mental illness were cured by lengthy discussions of personal pasts, the Devil might be repelled by endless talk of sex and childhood; that the Devil, if he existed, seemingly took possession of people with varying degrees of tenacity\u2014that he could be talked out of some patients, could be shocked out of others, and that he couldn\u2019t be driven out of some without the patients\u2019 being killed in the process.\nI was present when a newspaper reporter quizzed Tarbell about these hypotheses. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d said the reporter.\n\u201cIf you mean that I offer these ideas in a playful spirit, yes.\u201d", 0.00801282051282051], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
