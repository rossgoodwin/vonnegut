WHEELER\nPaul Moore was Episcopal bishop of New York.\nDear Jack P. Wheeler\u2014\nI respond to your letter of June 13 to Paul Moore, about my sermon at St. John the Divine. I got a copy of that letter only this morning.\nI was praising the Vietnam veterans. I have always respected and praised them. This was perfectly clear to the congregation which heard my sermon. I had nothing to do with the sermon\u2019s being picked up by the Times, which, on its own, ran about a third of it. But that third is not a misrepresentation of what I said. If people misread me, there is nothing I can do about that.\nThe Times fragment has since been syndicated all over the world, again without my connivance. I got paid nothing for it. Your letter has worried me a lot, as indeed it should. I am somewhat relieved, at least, that you are the only reader so far to suggest to me that I have spoken ill of Vietnam vets.

could, and looked down the long, long, long road through B Band to A Band, the Lincoln High School Ten Square Band, the finest band in the world.\nHelmholtz stepped onto the podium and raised his baton. \"You are better than you think,\" he said. \"A-one, a-two, a-three.\" Down came the baton.\nC Band set out in its quest for beauty\u2014set out like a rusty switch engine, with valves stuck, pipes clogged, unions leaking, bearings dry.\nHelmholtz was still smiling at the end of the hour, because he\u2019d heard in his mind the music as it was going to be someday. His throat was raw, for he had been singing with the band for the whole hour. He stepped into the hall for a drink from the fountain.\nAs he drank, he heard the jingling of chains. He looked up at Jim Donnini. Rivers of students flowed between classrooms, pausing in friendly eddies, flowing on again. Jim was alone. When he paused, it wasn\u2019t to greet anyone, but to polish the toes of his boots on his trousers legs. He had the air of a spy in a melodrama, missing nothing, liking nothing, looking forward to the great day when everything would be turned upside down.\n\"Hello, Jim,\" said Helmholtz. \"Say, I was just thinking about you. We\u2019ve got a lot of clubs and teams that meet after school. And that\u2019s a good way to get to know a lot of people.\"\nJim measured Helmholtz carefully with his eyes. \"Maybe I don\u2019t want to know a lot of people,\" he said. \"Ever think of that?\" He set his feet down hard to make his chains jingle as he walked away.\nWhen Helmholtz returned to the podium for a rehearsal of B Band, there was a note waiting for him, calling him to a special faculty meeting.\nThe meeting was about vandalism.\nSomeone had broken into the school and wrecked the office of Mr. Crane, head of the English Department. The poor man\u2019s treasures\u2014books, diplomas, snapshots of England, the beginnings of eleven novels\u2014had been ripped and crumpled, mixed, dumped and trampled, and drenched with ink.", 0.05854881743770631], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}}
