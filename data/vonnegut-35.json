I am a brilliant rationalizer over a couple of drinks.\nFirst off, leave me point out that nobody in the village or anywhere else would wince if the villain of my story were Baron Wolfgang von Steinhaus Kriegswald, scourge of the infamous S.S., ca. 1942.\nSecond off, I am a registered Democrat, pro-Fair and New Deal, distressed by the new anti-subversive laws, hate McCarthy, enflamed by Communist smears on liberals\u2014etc., etc. But, dammit, Knox, I don\u2019t like Communist Russia any more than I did Nazi Germany. There are some 3,000 Americans dead in Korea, killed in a chess game with Russia looking on. That is a lot of dead people and a plenty sickening situation. I have sixteen on my chessboard, which is peanuts.

Timequake One, set in the office of Monica Pepper, fictitious Executive Secretary of the Academy, on Christmas Eve, 2000. That was the afternoon on which Kilgore Trout put \u201cThe Sisters B-36\u201d in the lidless wire trash receptacle out front, again, fifty-one days before the timequake struck.\nMrs. Pepper, wife of the wheelchair-ridden composer Zoltan Pepper, bore a striking resemblance to my late sister Allie, who hated life so much. Allie died of cancer of the everything way back in 1958, when I was thirty-six and she was forty-one, hounded by bill collectors to the very end. Both women were pretty blondes, which was OK. But they were six-foot-two! Both women were permanently acculturated in adolescence, since nowhere on Earth, save among the Watusis, did it make any sense for a woman to be that tall.\nBoth women were unlucky. Allie married a nice guy who lost all their money and then some in dumb businesses. Monica Pepper was the reason her husband Zoltan was paralyzed from the waist down. Two years earlier, she had accidentally landed on top of him in a swimming pool out in Aspen, Colorado. At least Allie had to die so deep in debt, and with four sons to raise, only once. After the timequake struck, Monica Pepper would have to swan-dive on top of her husband a second time.\nMonica and Zoltan were talking in her office at the Academy that Christmas Eve, 2000. Zoltan was crying and laughing simultaneously. They were the same age, forty, which made them baby boomers. They didn\u2019t have any kids. Because of her, his ding-dong didn\u2019t work anymore. Zoltan was crying and laughing about that, certainly, but mostly about a tone-deaf kid next door, who had composed and orchestrated an acceptable, if derivative, string quartet in the manner of Beethoven, with the help of a new computer program called Wolfgang.\nNothing would do but that the father of the obnoxious kid show Zoltan the sheet music his son\u2019s printer had spit out that morning and ask him if it was any good or not.\nAs though Zoltan weren\u2019t sufficiently destabilized emotionally by legs and a ding-dong that didn\u2019t work anymore, his older brother Frank, an architect, had committed suicide after a nearly identical blow to his self-respect only a month earlier. Yes, and Frank Pepper would eventually be popped out of his grave by the timequake, so he could blow his brains out while his wife and three kids watched a second time.\nHere\u2019s the thing: Frank went to the drugstore for condoms or chewing gum or whatever, and the pharmacist told him that his sixteen-year-old daughter had become an architect and was thinking of dropping out of high school because it was such a waste of time. She had designed a recreation center for teenagers in depressed neighborhoods with the help of a new computer program the school had bought for its vocational students, dummies who weren\u2019t going to anything but junior colleges. It was called Palladio.\nFrank went to a computer store, and asked if he could try out Palladio before buying it. He doubted very much that it could help anyone with his native talent and education. So right there in the store, and in a period of no more than half an hour, Palladio gave him what he had asked it for, working drawings that would enable a contractor to build a three-story parking garage in the manner of Thomas Jefferson.\nFrank had made up the craziest assignment he could think of, confident that Palladio would tell him to take his custom elsewhere. But it didn\u2019t! It presented him with menu after menu, asking how many cars, and in what city, because of various local building codes, and whether trucks would be allowed to use it, too, and on and on. It even asked about surrounding buildings, and whether Jeffersonian architecture would be in harmony with them. It offered to give him alternative plans in the manner of Michael Graves or I. M. Pei.\nIt gave him plans for the wiring and plumbing, and ballpark estimates of what it would cost to build in any part of the world he cared to name.", 0.09706748334407908], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["thee", 0.12271711336049992], ["harry", 0.1122766229396791], ["read", 0.09876131959976031], ["wings", 0.09163497859480746], ["helene", 0.09102637426430445], ["love", 0.07744167591877071], ["reading", 0.0684816554346933], ["week", 0.0606842495095363], ["dropped", 0.059443124103044545], ["town", 0.05717806572503716], ["everyday", 0.05638106899613555], ["kidnaped", 0.05638106899613555], ["luckiest", 0.05638106899613555], ["othello", 0.05638106899613555], ["swords", 0.05638106899613555], ["murther", 0.05638106899613555], ["erperch", 0.05638106899613555], ["peril", 0.05638106899613555], ["faust", 0.05638106899613555], ["alack", 0.05638106899613555], ["attempt", 0.05638106899613555], ["limits", 0.05638106899613555], ["enmity", 0.05638106899613555], ["thine", 0.05638106899613555], ["stony", 0.05638106899613555], ["married", 0.05010643533801183], ["lies", 0.04971619225998223], ["billing", 0.04971619225998223], ["proof", 0.04971619225998223], ["exit", 0.04971619225998223], ["gay", 0.04971619225998223], ["backstage", 0.04971619225998223], ["thy", 0.04971619225998223], ["kinsmen", 0.04971619225998223], ["dares", 0.04971619225998223], ["depending", 0.04581748929740373], ["mistakes", 0.04305131552382892], ["paris", 0.04305131552382892], ["straightened", 0.04305131552382892], ["plays", 0.04305131552382892], ["dumb", 0.040905704453499975], ["cleared", 0.040905704453499975], ["machine", 0.03915261256125041], ["account", 0.03915261256125041], ["strange", 0.03915261256125041], ["party", 0.03767039448598831], ["brave", 0.035253909598671904], ["throat", 0.035253909598671904], ["cast", 0.035253909598671904], ["eye", 0.03424082771734665], ["loud", 0.03424082771734665], ["led", 0.0333243836807666], ["walls", 0.0333243836807666], ["walking", 0.032487735825097085], ["sweet", 0.032487735825097085], ["hold", 0.031005517749834986], ["change", 0.031005517749834986], ["thought", 0.030787524972245805], ["phone", 0.03034212475476815], ["time", 0.030096623365184427], ["loved", 0.029721562051522273], ["office", 0.02913863299559501], ["light", 0.027106814787256486], ["chance", 0.02623208615066296], ["company", 0.025822859088943766], ["women", 0.025053217669005916], ["making", 0.025053217669005916], ["happy", 0.024690329899940078], ["started", 0.023677248018614826], ["play", 0.02276080398203478], ["twenty", 0.021660704451479548], ["wouldn", 0.021404278998766457], ["kind", 0.021404278998766457], ["girl", 0.020215683268312835], ["voice", 0.01977854505603632], ["heard", 0.019157982352790447], ["day", 0.018205185211980533], ["years", 0.016853435686776785], ["asked", 0.01654323508852466], ["door", 0.01525927939021194], ["told", 0.014613709170619358], ["will", 0.014126750201208254]], "sentiment": ["Harry cleared his throat.

Why mustn\u2019t we fly too close to the sun, eh?

Irreconcilable differences had arisen between him and his sweetheart for the past semester and a half, Sally Freeman, and Sally had turned to Steve Adams, the captain of the basketball team, for consolation.\nThis left the president of the class without a date for the prom, and at a time when every girl of any social importance had been spoken for.\nFelix executed a sociological master stroke. He invited a girl who was at the bottom of the social order, whose parents were illiterate and unemployed, who had two brothers in prison, who got very poor grades and engaged in no extracurricular activities, but who, nonetheless, was one of the prettiest young women anybody had ever seen.\nHer family was white, but they were so poor that they lived in the black part of town.

He broke into a run. As he loped after Mr. Banghart he told himself that he was no good to anyone; but by the time he had put the fence and barnyard between himself and the house, new strength flowed into his long legs\u2014the quick, mad joy of liberation.\nHe overtook Mr. Banghart in a small grove of elms a few hundred feet from the highway. They trotted together to the road\u2019s shoulder and waved their thumbs at an approaching car. The General\u2019s voice, shouting their names, reached them as clearly as though he were riding them piggyback. Haley laughed aloud; the sound was no more awesome than the chatter of two red squirrels in the elms to his back.\nThe automobile, a new maroon sedan, came to a stop beside them. Mr. Banghart climbed in front, and Haley sat by himself on the broad rear seat. The driver was a husky blond man of, Haley guessed, about forty. His chin was covered with stubble, and his eyes were red. \u201cBeen driving all night,\u201d he said. \u201cNeed somebody to keep me awake. Where are you headed?\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d asked Mr. Banghart.\n\u201cChicago.\u201d\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going, too.\u201d\nHaley watched through the back window as the car pulled away, and the silos and red roofs of Ardennes Farm slowly lost their identities in the buff horizon of grainland. The sway and hum of the automobile soon lulled him to sleep.\nVI.\nIn his dreams Haley felt again the quake of the toppling bales and the sensation of falling. The image ended with a solid thump, and he awakened to find himself on the automobile floor, whence a sudden stop had rolled him.", 0.06848169191919191], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"},

vigorously in time to the hymn he was leading. They took seats by themselves on the rear-most bench. From the room behind the pulpit came a clinking of heavy bowls and the dense smell of boiling kraut. Two dozen unkempt men mumbled the words in their hymnals under the haranguing of the leader. Haley yearned to get at the piano that stood in one corner, and wondered if he might not get permission to play it when the singing was at an end.\nMr. Banghart seemed soothed by the devotional atmosphere. He picked up two hymnals from a shelf along the wall, handed one to Haley, and burst into song with startling volume and brilliance. The young man directing the singing stared with surprise and gratitude, and his unwashed congregation turned their heads to squint in wonder.\n\u201cWelcome, brother,\u201d said the young man at the end of the hymn. Mr. Banghart stood up, proud and poised, and bowed to the young man and then to the congregation. \u201cI would now like to sing Throw Out the Lifeline,\u201d he said.\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said the young man happily. \u201cLet\u2019s all turn to number 29.\u201d\nA short, stocky youth, wearing the threadbare remnants of an Army uniform, turned around in his seat on the bench in front of Haley and said in a loud hiss to Mr. Banghart, \u201cShut up, Buster, and sit down, or we\u2019ll never get anything to eat.\u201d\nMr. Banghart stopped his singing abruptly in mid-chorus, leaving only the reedy tenor of the leader and the apathetic murmur of the others to carry on. \u201cI would appreciate an apology,\u201d he said coldly.\n\u201cGo to hell,\u201d said the youth, giving him an ugly grin. His two companions turned to sneer menacingly. The singing stopped completely.\nHaley saw a look of fear pass over Mr. Banghart\u2019s features, and then heard him shout wildly, \u201cIt\u2019s a trap! They\u2019re out to get us!\u201d Mr. Banghart smashed his hard, massive fist into the youth\u2019s insolent face, catapulting him over the bench and on to the floor.\n\u201cStop it!\u201d cried the young man behind the pulpit.\nThe youth arose from the floor, and he and his two companions started toward Haley and Mr. Banghart. Haley raised his frail hands in a gesture of defense as one of them singled him out and charged. The blow of a fist on his temple spun him around. He sank to his knees, and looked up, stunned and frightened. He blinked dully at the flash of light from Mr. Banghart\u2019s knife, heard a scream, and was knocked senseless by another blow from behind.", -0.06524074074074074], "title": "Basic Training"},

"sentiment": ["Billy Pilgrim was having a delightful hallucination. He was wearing dry, warm, white sweatsocks, and he was skating on a ballroom floor. Thousands cheered. This wasn\u2019t time-travel. It had never happened, never would happen. It was the craziness of a dying young man with his shoes full of snow.\nOne scout hung his head, let spit fall from his lips. The other did the same. They studied the infinitesimal effects of spit on snow and history. They were small, graceful people. They had been behind German lines before many times\u2014living like woods creatures, living from moment to moment in useful terror, thinking brainlessly with their spinal cords.\nNow they twisted out from under Weary\u2019s loving arms. They told Weary that he and Billy had better find somebody to surrender to. The scouts weren\u2019t going to wait for them anymore.\nAnd they ditched Weary and Billy in the creek-bed.\nBilly Pilgrim went on skating, doing tricks in sweatsocks, tricks that most people would consider impossible\u2014making turns, stopping on a dime and so on. The cheering went on, but its tone was altered as the hallucination gave way to time-travel.\nBilly stopped skating, found himself at a lectern in a Chinese restaurant in Ilium, New York, on an early afternoon in the autumn of 1957. He was receiving a standing ovation from the Lions Club. He had just been elected President, and it was necessary that he speak. He was scared stiff, thought a ghastly mistake had been made. All those prosperous, solid men out there would discover now that they had elected a ludicrous waif. They would hear his reedy voice, the one he\u2019d had in the war. He swallowed, knew that all he had for a voice box was a little whistle cut from a willow switch. Worse\u2014he had nothing to say. The crowd quieted down. Everybody was pink and beaming.\nBilly opened his mouth, and out came a deep, resonant tone. His voice was a gorgeous instrument. It told jokes which brought down the house. It grew serious, told jokes again, and ended on a note of humility. The explanation of the miracle was this: Billy had taken a course in public speaking.\nAnd then he was back in the bed of the frozen creek again. Roland Weary was about to beat the living shit out of him.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWeary was filled with a tragic wrath. He had been ditched again. He stuffed his pistol into its holster. He slipped his knife into its scabbard. Its triangular blade and blood gutters on all three faces.

But under those particular circumstances, Mandarax wasn\u2019t really much help.\nThe uselessness of all its knowledge would so anger the Captain that he threatened to throw it into the ocean. On the last day of his life, when he was eighty-six and Mary was eighty-one, he would actually carry out that threat. As the new Adam, it might be said, his final act was to cast the Apple of Knowledge into the deep blue sea.\nUnder the circumstances peculiar to Santa Rosalia, the medical advice of Mandarax was bound to sound like mockery. When Hisako Hiroguchi entered a deep depression which was to last until her death, to last for nearly twenty years, Mandarax recommended new hobbies, new friends, a change of scene and perhaps profession, and lithium. When the kidneys of Selena MacIntosh began to fail when she was only thirty-eight, Mandarax suggested that a compatible donor for a transplant be located as soon as possible. Hisako\u2019s furry daughter Akiko, when Akiko was six, came down with pneumonia, apparently caught from a fur seal who was her best friend, and Mandarax recommended antibiotics. Hisako and the blind Selena were then living together and raising Akiko together, almost like husband and wife.\nAnd when Mandarax was asked to come up with quotations from world literature which could be used in a celebration of some event on the slag heap of Santa Rosalia, the instrument almost always came up with clunkers. Here were its thoughts when Akiko gave birth, at the age of twenty-four, to her own furry daughter and the first member of the second generation of human beings to be born on the island:\nIf I were

a cobbler as my father, my mother read about an American artist who made as much money as many movie stars and tycoons, and was in fact the friend and equal of movie stars and tycoons, and had a yacht\u2014and a horse farm in Virginia, and a beach house in Montauk, not far from here.\nMother would say later, and not all that much later, since she had only one more year to live, that she never would have read the article if it hadn\u2019t been for a photograph of this rich artist on his yacht. The name of the yacht was the name of the mountain as sacred to Armenians as Fujiyama is to the Japanese: Ararat.\nThis man had to be an Armenian, she thought, and so he was. The magazine said he had been born Dan Gregorian in Moscow, where his father was a horse trainer, and that he had been apprenticed to the chief engraver of the Russian Imperial Mint.\nHe had come to this country in 1907 as an ordinary immigrant, not a refugee from any massacre, and had changed his name to Dan Gregory, and had become an illustrator of magazine stories and advertisements, and of books for young people. The author of the article said he was probably the highest paid artist in American history.\nThat could still be true of Dan Gregory, or \u201cGregorian,\u201d as my parents always called him, if his income in the 1920s, or especially during the Great Depression, were translated into the depreciated dollars of today. He could still be the champ, living or dead.\nMy mother was shrewd about the United States, as my father was not. She had figured out that the most pervasive American disease was loneliness, and that even people at the top often suffered from it, and that they could be surprisingly responsive to attractive strangers who were friendly.\nSo my mother said to me, and I hardly recognized her, so sly and witchlike had her face become: \u201cYou must write to this Gregorian. You must tell him that you are also Armenian.

So did Albert, who never liked dowries anyway. And Edith did not want to make her permanent home in Germany. The captain was likewise not an enthusiastic candidate for a job in the brewery. At all events, the engagement was broken by mutual consent and Edith returned to Indianapolis where her father built for her a small cottage on his estate very attractively situated on a bluff overlooking White River. It was furnished to her taste; had a grand piano in the living room, a fireplace, comfortable lounge chairs and couches; and it was her own retreat when she wanted privacy\u2014which was most of the time. But she got along well enough with her father and his third wife Meda and their two young children. She resumed contact with her old friends, went about in the social life of the city, and had plenty of suitors. Kurt Vonnegut, Sr., fell deeply in love with her and she reciprocated his affection. In every respect the match was universally approved.\n\u201cEdith and Kurt\u2019s wedding celebration was one long remembered in Indianapolis. It was probably the biggest and most costly party which the town had ever seen or is likely ever to witness again. The couple were married by the Reverend Frank S. C. Wicks, a Unitarian clergyman, in an evening ceremony in the First Unitarian Church attended by members of the two families\u2014Lieber and Vonnegut\u2014and a bevy of lovely bridesmaids and handsome ushers. But these families in three generations were then numerous and both clans had many friends. The Liebers and the Vonneguts with the Hollwegs, Mayers, Severeins, Schnulls, Rauchs, Frenzels, Pantzers, Haueisens, Kipps, Kuhns, Metzgers, and Kothes were the leading German families of the city. They were all convivial people, sentimental and emotional. And they loved to celebrate weddings, particularly between congenial clans of a common heritage and cultural background. The nuptials qualified to be celebrated in accordance with the best German traditions: food, drink, dancing, music, and song. Albert decided to give them a party to end all parties.\n\u201cIn 1913 the Claypool Hotel, situated on the northwest corner of Washington Street and Illinois Street in the very heart of the city of Indianapolis, was one of the finest hostelries in the Midwest. It has just been completed about ten years before and was in prime condition. Eight stories high, it contained five hundred bedrooms. Its main lobby was 80 feet square and 60 feet high, elaborately decorated in the fashion of the time. The mezzanine story had a huge ballroom about 125 feet by 80 feet. This later was named the Riley Room after the Hoosier poet\u2014James Whitcomb Riley. On the Illinois Street side of the mezzanine floor were a series of private dining rooms decorated in red and gold in Louis XV rococo. The proprietor of this garish caravansary was Henry Lawrence. He and Albert Lieber were buddies. And so Albert decided to throw the wedding celebration party for Edith and Kurt in the Claypool. Henry Lawrence decided to give his all\u2014and did so.\n\u201cIn addition to the numerous relatives of the Lieber-Vonnegut clans Albert had a host of friends, a rigid selection of whom had to be invited. About six hundred of them came, including Colonel Thompson who journeyed from London to represent the English syndicate. The men guests were arrayed in white tie and tails, the women in long elaborate ball gowns. The chefs of the hotel were put to work days ahead and a large buffet of choice viands was served. Champagne of rarest vintages flowed like water. Then the floor was cleared and a large band of musicians played for dancing in the ballroom.\n\u201cA bar some sixty feet long had been specially erected. Here every variety of beverage was provided. The party lasted through the night and until six o\u2019clock in the morning. Never before or since have so many otherwise respectable and thoroughly conservative citizens of the dull community passed out in so short a time. The consumption of spirits after the preliminary foundation of champagne was like pouring gasoline on a hot fire. It was estimated later that about seventy-five men and ten or fifteen women passed out cold. But Henry Lawrence was ready for the occasion. He had reserved plenty of bedrooms above and, as guests wavered and lost the coordination required for locomotion, they were gently assisted by the hotel waiters and bellmen to comfortable beds and the arms of Morpheus where a few of them were still reposing three days later.\n\u201cIt was a grand occasion, but the Vonneguts and Schnulls thought it was all rather vulgar, and did not hesitate to express their disapproval. Some of the town wags, who were familiar with Albert\u2019s ways, in commenting on the huge cost of the bash said: \u2019What the Hell! Albert probably charged the tab to the brewery, and let the syndicate unwittingly give the party.\u2019 It was a strictly fin de si\u00e8cle affair.\n\u201cThe next year came the First World War and then Prohibition. The curtain fell on a glorious scene\u2014never to be witnessed again.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cKurt and Edith\u2019s marriage was a happy and congenial one\u2014as marriages go. At first they were reasonably affluent\u2014had servants, governesses for their children, and lived well. But they were both inclined to be extravagant. They traveled and entertained rather lavishly. If they needed money, they sold securities or borrowed. After Prohibition in 1921 Albert was no longer able to help them.", 0.1772875226039783], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["telephone", 0.20220536772581008], ["listening", 0.12528223667313568], ["almighty", 0.11265551363857189], ["values", 0.11265551363857189], ["three", 0.10894026865633082], ["ringing", 0.10322609251977737], ["sense", 0.08710639064629026], ["office", 0.08695855218471327], ["minot", 0.0835214911154238], ["patty", 0.0835214911154238], ["lee", 0.0804161098915977], ["verne", 0.06912523045481395], ["mouthpiece", 0.06438760775602949], ["empowered", 0.06438760775602949], ["unitarian", 0.06438760775602949], ["correcting", 0.06438760775602949], ["signalled", 0.06438760775602949], ["open", 0.06155726765400865], ["skin", 0.056327756819285944], ["cellophane", 0.056327756819285944], ["picture", 0.05585674537417179], ["listened", 0.05161304625988868], ["phone", 0.05161304625988868], ["switch", 0.05161304625988868], ["valor", 0.04826790588254239], ["god", 0.04746108617562922], ["wearing", 0.04567321342540042], ["bathrobe", 0.04567321342540042], ["meaning", 0.04567321342540042], ["copy", 0.04567321342540042], ["hearing", 0.04567321342540042], ["realized", 0.04567321342540042], ["lunch", 0.04355319532314513], ["darn", 0.04355319532314513], ["lines", 0.04355319532314513], ["male", 0.04355319532314513], ["named", 0.0417607455577119], ["sitting", 0.0417607455577119], ["york", 0.04020805494579885], ["couple", 0.04020805494579885], ["petrie", 0.04020805494579885], ["winked", 0.03883848476374787], ["afternoon", 0.036505104583955415], ["happened", 0.03549334438640158], ["suppose", 0.03456261522740697], ["fingers", 0.03370089462096835], ["wonderful", 0.03370089462096835], ["desk", 0.03289865192925961], ["magazine", 0.03144326654607349], ["held", 0.030778633827004326], ["listen", 0.030778633827004326], ["poor", 0.030778633827004326], ["coming", 0.027433493449658033], ["front", 0.027433493449658033], ["hear", 0.026502764290663422], ["hand", 0.023383415609329942], ["woman", 0.020652722689825282], ["people", 0.020385402710468317], ["years", 0.01961844959661021], ["looked", 0.016028502135568192], ["good", 0.014184257598630538], ["time", 0.012194161596353453]], "sentiment": ["A: After a couple of years, it was getting under my skin.\nQ: Why?\nA: Because it showed a darn poor sense of values.\nQ: Do you think you are God Almighty, empowered to go around correcting people\u2019s sense of values?\nA: I do not think I am God Almighty.

She destroyed herself automatically while giving birth to Dwayne. The printer disappeared. He was a disappearing machine.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt may be that the subject of adoption caused an unfortunate chemical reaction in Dwayne\u2019s head. At any rate, Dwayne suddenly snarled this at Harry: \u201cHarry, why don\u2019t you get a bunch of cotton waste from Vern Garr, soak it in Blue Sunoco, and burn up your fucking wardrobe? You make me feel like I\u2019m at Watson Brothers.\u201d Watson Brothers was the name of the funeral parlor for white people who were at least moderately well-to-do. Blue Sunoco was a brand of gasoline.\nHarry was startled, and then pain set in. Dwayne had never said anything about his clothes in all the years he\u2019d known him. The clothes were conservative and neat, in Harry\u2019s opinion. His shirts were white. His ties were black or navy blue. His suits were gray or dark blue. His shoes and socks were black.\n\u201cListen, Harry,\u201d said Dwayne, and his expression was mean, \u201cHawaiian Week is coming up, and I\u2019m absolutely serious: burn your clothes and get new ones, or apply for work at Watson Brothers. Have yourself embalmed while you\u2019re at it.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHarry couldn\u2019t do anything but let his mouth hang open. The Hawaiian Week Dwayne had mentioned was a sales promotion scheme which involved making the agency look as much like the Hawaiian Islands as possible. People who bought new or used cars, or had repairs done in excess of five hundred dollars during the week would be entered automatically in a lottery. Three lucky people would each win a free, all-expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas and San Francisco and then Hawaii for a party of two.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind that you have the name of a Buick, Harry, when you\u2019re supposed to be selling Pontiacs\u2014\u201d Dwayne went on. He was referring to the fact that the Buick division of General Motors put out a model called the Le Sabre. \u201cYou can\u2019t help that.\u201d Dwayne now patted the top of his desk softly. This was somehow more menacing than if he had pounded the desk with his fist. \u201cBut there are a hell of a lot of things you can change, Harry. There\u2019s a long weekend coming up. I expect to see some big changes in you when I come to work on Tuesday morning.\u201d\nThe weekend was extra-long because the coming Monday was a national holiday, Veterans\u2019 Day. It was in honor of people who had served their country in uniform.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", -0.02393250688705234], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["stud", 0.08968996319746819], ["flares", 0.08080498115242908], ["bayonet", 0.057308767970455164], ["men", 0.05644508127461754], ["poritsky", 0.0527772507956657], ["helmet", 0.05144213794819231], ["nineteen", 0.048076979589142074], ["ghosts", 0.0465570161637566], ["eighteen", 0.04333545673731995], ["ascared", 0.04309096709807249], ["walking", 0.04040249057621454], ["scientists", 0.04040249057621454], ["attack", 0.04040249057621454], ["will", 0.038446959042733334], ["officers", 0.03820584531363678], ["lines", 0.036348608207284264], ["machine", 0.03473979624795267], ["em", 0.033827750184968516], ["ain", 0.03151750853117542], ["hate", 0.030903004306765503], ["newcastle", 0.029896654399156068], ["eighteenth", 0.029896654399156068], ["dugout", 0.029896654399156068], ["weapons", 0.029896654399156068], ["pump", 0.029896654399156068], ["forehead", 0.029896654399156068], ["insult", 0.029896654399156068], ["log", 0.029896654399156068], ["chaplain", 0.029896654399156068], ["coals", 0.029896654399156068], ["pumped", 0.029896654399156068], ["amounts", 0.029896654399156068], ["edges", 0.029896654399156068], ["attacking", 0.029896654399156068], ["things", 0.02822254063730877], ["going", 0.02770461935016136], ["time", 0.02770461935016136], ["happy", 0.027166197941659007], ["teau", 0.025721068974096154], ["bump", 0.025721068974096154], ["dreaming", 0.025721068974096154], ["yards", 0.025721068974096154], ["ch", 0.025721068974096154], ["acted", 0.025721068974096154], ["thierry", 0.025721068974096154], ["encouraging", 0.025721068974096154], ["fancy", 0.025721068974096154], ["july", 0.025721068974096154], ["ordinary", 0.025721068974096154], ["counter", 0.025721068974096154], ["olden", 0.025721068974096154], ["muzzle", 0.0232785080818783], ["apart", 0.0232785080818783], ["faith", 0.0232785080818783], ["artillery", 0.0232785080818783], ["kissed", 0.0232785080818783], ["oil", 0.0232785080818783], ["civilian", 0.021545483549036244], ["common", 0.021545483549036244], ["hisself", 0.021545483549036244], ["happen", 0.021545483549036244], ["slaughterhouse", 0.021545483549036244], ["wasn", 0.021300993909788787], ["questions", 0.02020124528810727], ["listening", 0.02020124528810727], ["screen", 0.02020124528810727], ["feeling", 0.02020124528810727], ["hollered", 0.02020124528810727], ["enlisted", 0.01910292265681839], ["beam", 0.01910292265681839], ["extra", 0.01910292265681839], ["taste", 0.01910292265681839], ["ideas", 0.01910292265681839], ["wonder", 0.018174304103642132], ["rested", 0.018174304103642132], ["mark", 0.018174304103642132], ["hoped", 0.018174304103642132], ["carrying", 0.018174304103642132], ["sense", 0.018174304103642132], ["intelligent", 0.018174304103642132], ["finally", 0.017369898123976334], ["rifle", 0.017369898123976334], ["iron", 0.017369898123976334], ["moved", 0.017369898123976334], ["looked", 0.01695778998518667], ["leaned", 0.01666036176460053], ["hair", 0.01602565986304736], ["today", 0.01602565986304736], ["bottle", 0.01602565986304736], ["company", 0.014927337231758478], ["lay", 0.014445152245773318], ["turn", 0.014445152245773318], ["nice", 0.014445152245773318], ["hours", 0.013583098970829504], ["air", 0.013583098970829504], ["crazy", 0.013583098970829504], ["germans", 0.013583098970829504], ["soldier", 0.013194312698916424], ["smoke", 0.013194312698916424], ["white", 0.013194312698916424], ["soldiers", 0.012829104133757176], ["army", 0.012159070187310042], ["help", 0.011850074437987447], ["small", 0.011850074437987447], ["set", 0.011850074437987447], ["times", 0.011850074437987447], ["americans", 0.011556157786364363], ["front", 0.0110081350260889], ["told", 0.010751751806698564], ["captain", 0.010269566820713406], ["hell", 0.01004221544732276], ["great", 0.01004221544732276], ["big", 0.008833355836104981], ["head", 0.008309190914480707], ["thing", 0.007674489012927536], ["man", 0.007100331303262929]], "sentiment": ["When you\u2019re in the Army of the World, with all the fancy new weapons they got, there ain\u2019t but one thing to do. You got to believe what the officers tell you, even if it don\u2019t make sense. And the officers, they got to believe what the scientists tell \u2019em.\nThings has got that far beyond the common man, and maybe they always was. When a chaplain hollered at us enlisted men about how we got to have great faith that don\u2019t ask no questions, he was carrying coals to Newcastle.\nWhen Poritsky finally done told us we was going to attack with the help of a time machine, there wasn\u2019t no intelligent ideas a ordinary soldier like me could have. I just set there like a bump on a log, and I looked at the bayonet stud on my rifle. I leaned over, so\u2019s the front of my helmet rested on the muzzle, and I looked at that there bayonet stud like it was a wonder of the world.\nAll two hundred of us in the time-screen company was in a big dugout, listening to Poritsky. Wasn\u2019t nobody looking at him. He was just too happy about what was going to happen, feeling hisself all over like he hoped he wasn\u2019t dreaming.\n\u201cMen,\u201d that crazy captain said, \u201cat oh-five-hundred hours the artillery will lay down two lines of flares, two hundred yards apart. Them flares will mark the edges of the beam of the time machine.

I like the taste of oil and iron in small amounts, but that ain\u2019t encouraging nobody to bottle it.\n\u201cMen,\u201d Poritsky said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see some things out there that\u2019d turn a civilian\u2019s hair white. You\u2019re going to see the Americans counter-attacking the Germans back in olden times at Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry.\u201d My, he was happy. \u201cMen,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a slaughterhouse in Hell.\u201d\nI moved my head up and down, so\u2019s my helmet acted like a pump. It pumped air down over my forehead. At a time like that, little things can be extra-nice.\n\u201cMen,\u201d Poritsky said, \u201cI hate to tell soldiers not to be ascared. I hate to tell \u2019em there ain\u2019t nothing to be ascared of. It\u2019s an insult to \u2019em. But the scientists tell me nineteen-eighteen can\u2019t do nothing to us, and we can\u2019t do nothing to nineteen-eighteen. We\u2019ll be ghosts to them, and they\u2019ll be ghosts to us.
