I know they took several long walking trips, just the two of them. I learned of their good times together from Mother. When I was old enough to be curious about Father\u2019s past, World War Two was about to break out, and Father had developed lockjaw as far as his friendship with Hitler was concerned.\nThink of that: My father could have strangled the worst monster of the century, or simply let him starve or freeze to death. But he became his bosom buddy instead.\nThat is my principal objection to life, I think: It is too easy, when alive, to make perfectly horrible mistakes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe painting Father bought from Hitler was a water-color which is now generally acknowledged as having been the best thing the monster ever did as a painter, and it hung for many years over my parents\u2019 bed in Midland City, Ohio. Its title was: \u201cThe Minorite Church of Vienna.\u201d\n2\nFATHER WAS so well received in Vienna, known to one and all as an American millionaire disguised as a ragged genius, that he roistered there for nearly four years. When the First World War broke out in August of 1914, he imagined that the fancy dress ball was to become a fancy dress picnic, that the party was to be moved out into the countryside. He was so happy, so naive, so self-enchanted, that he asked influential friends if they couldn\u2019t get him a commission in the Hungarian Life Guard, whose officers\u2019 uniforms included a panther skin.\nHe adored that panther skin.\nHe was summoned by the American ambassador to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Henry Clowes, who was a Cleveland man and an acquaintance of Father\u2019s parents. Father was then twenty-two years old. Clowes told Father that he would lose his American citizenship if he joined a foreign army, and that he had made inquiries about Father, and had learned that Father was not the painter he pretended to be, and that Father had been spending money like a drunken sailor, and that he had written to Father\u2019s parents, telling them that their son had lost all touch with reality, and that it was time

"sentiment": ["She died last July at the age of ninety-eight. Admiral Burke, by then retired of course, died a year before that at the age of ninety-nine. They met on a blind date in 1919, when he was in his first year at the Naval Academy. On that date, she was a last minute substitute for her older sister. Fate.\nThey married four years later. If past performance is any indication, they will surely stay married there at the far end of the blue tunnel throughout all eternity. She said to me, \u201cWhy fool around?\u201d President Clinton told her at her husband\u2019s funeral, when she still had a year to live, \u201cYou have blessed America with your service and set an example not only for navy wives today, and to come, but for all Americans.\u201d\nThe simple epitaph Roberta Gorsuch Burke chose for her tombstone here on Earth: \u201cA Sailor\u2019s Wife.\u201d\ndr. jack kevorkian has again\nunstrapped me from what has become my personal gurney, here, in the lethal injection facility at Huntsville, Texas. Jack has now supervised fifteen controlled near-death experiences for me. Hey, Jack, way to go! On this morning\u2019s trip down the blue tunnel to the pearly gates, Clarence Darrow, the great American defense attorney, dead for sixty years now, came looking for me. He wanted WNYC\u2019s listeners to hear his opinions of television cameras in courtrooms. \u201cI welcome them,\u201d he said, if you can believe it. This man with the reputation of a giant, comes from a rinky-dink little farm town in Ohio.\n\u201cThe presence of those cameras finally acknowledges,\u201d he said to me, \u201cthat justice systems anywhere, anytime, have never cared whether justice was achieved or not. Like Roman games, justice systems are ways for unjust governments\u2014and there is no other sort of government\u2014to be enormously entertaining with real lives at stake.\u201d\nI thanked Mr. Darrow for having made American history much more humane than it would have been otherwise, with his eloquent defenses in court of early organizers of labor unions, of teachers of unpopular scientific truths, and for his vociferous contempt for racism, and for his loathing of the death penalty. And the late, great lawyer Clarence Darrow said only this to me: \u201cI did my best to entertain.\u201d\nSigning off now. Hey, Jack, waddaya say we go downtown for some of that good old Tex-Mex cuisine?\nduring what has been almost\na year of interviewing completely dead people, while only half dead myself, I asked Saint Peter again and again if I could meet a particular hero of mine. He is my fellow Hoosier, the late Eugene Victor Debs of Terre Haute, Indiana. He was five times the Socialist Party\u2019s candidate for president back when this country still had a strong Socialist Party.", 0.1190179573512907], "title": "God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian"},

Everybody expected him to win the war single-handedly. But when the going got tough over there in France, he cracked up completely. It turned out he didn\u2019t know the first thing about leadership, and he couldn\u2019t even take care of himself, so he was sick all the time.\u201d The General lowered his voice. \u201cThe morale in his company was so bad that all his men had thrown away their gas masks rather than carry them on marches. The first thing you know, the Jerries dropped mustard-gas shells all over them. Zip! One whole company wiped out! And I\u2019ll always say it was a library card that killed them. See my point?\u201d\n\u201cYessir, I think so. He was one-sided. Is that it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it in a nutshell,\u201d said the General, beaming. \u201cYou expressed it perfectly. That\u2019s why I brought my whole family out here to the farm to live after the war, to keep us all from getting soft, from getting one-sided. Now spruce up for supper. People with dirty fingernails don\u2019t get to eat around here.\u201d\nII.\nAt 2 a.m. Central Standard Time, as reckoned by the parlor mantel clock in the home of Brigadier General William Cooley, retired, a light beam left the burning sun. At 2:08 it glanced from the lip of a moon crater, and a second later died on earth, in the staring eyes of Haley Brandon.\nHaley lay sleepless between cool sheets, his thin arms folded behind his head, his eyes fixed on the window through which the wistful moonlight streamed. He felt wholly a stranger. None of the old, seemingly sweetly reasonable patterns of the past now applied. He was not actively melancholy\u2014it was too soon for that. Rather, he was like a settler on his first day in a foreign land, bemused by his initial contacts with unfamiliar customs, not yet ready to admit that it would be those customs instead of his own that would enable him to remain and prosper.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see to it that you earn your way as best you can\u2014with good, old-fashioned work. Sounds harsh, maybe, but you\u2019ll thank us for it in later years. We\u2019ll put some meat on you, too,\u201d the General had said at supper. The sweat- and sinew-worship that seemed to pervade life at Ardennes Farm was a great curiosity to Haley. Robust was the password. As a Manhattan cliff-dweller, he had won the loyalty of his small circle of friends\u2014most of them adults and fellow musicians\u2014with the cleverness of his fingers on a piano keyboard, with his promise as a concert pianist. Now, he reflected, the emphasis had been changed to the cleanliness of his fingers, to whether he could move a piano.\nHaley thought about the peculiar man into whose hands he had been delivered for guidance. The General, he knew from having heard his mother talk about him, was a competent manager, a brave soldier, and well off financially, though not given to exhibiting the last-named quality. He had taken over management of the old Cooley farmstead, run by tenants for nearly a generation, after his retirement from the Army. Haley remembered a few discussions between his mother and father as to the truth of his mother\u2019s contention that the General, \u201cdown deep,\u201d had a heart of gold. His mother had never been able to produce much evidence for the affirmative. His father, on the other hand, had always had dozens of incidents to recall, which seemed to back up his opinion that the General was a \u201cpompous, selfish old teddy bear with sawdust for brains.\u201d As he lay abed for his first night in his new home, Haley thought he liked the General. The man was gruff, certainly, but he always gave sound reasons for the things he did.\nHaley flexed his fingers and recalled the dreamlike quality his music had given his life in the past; and a pleasurable shudder passed over him as he reminded himself that that part of his life would begin anew in thirty days\u2014for the General had promised that he might go to Chicago to resume his studies then. That was all that really mattered, Haley decided. Knowing that that much of the future was assured, he decided that he could adjust to any of the new order\u2019s rigors and get along with just about anyone.\nIt was certainly to the General\u2019s credit as a man of compassion that he should understand the importance of music to his new charge, Haley thought, for the man was as tone-deaf as a sparrow, and so were two of his three daughters. Judging from the whistling and humming they did, he had concluded that only Hope was able to carry a tune. Haley had heard that this was a hereditary trait. His mother, or, as Annie had reminded him, his foster mother, had been similarly afflicted. In this thought Haley found some consolation for his not being a blood relative of the Cooleys. There were apparently no instruments on the farm, and the evening\u2019s choice of radio programs had indicated that the General and his family found homicide far more entertaining than music. As Haley had undressed for bed, he had been surprised to hear an excellent, if untrained, tenor voice singing hymns in the barn, and he had wondered who it might have been. It could not have been a Cooley, at any rate. He decided to ask about it in the morning.", 0.13591974755767855], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["singing", 0.06526409635652138], ["sake", 0.06526409635652138], ["flemming", 0.040456908861563584], ["bulletin", 0.040456908861563584], ["ages", 0.03949489155014133], ["bawled", 0.03949489155014133], ["soothingly", 0.03949489155014133], ["pleasantry", 0.03949489155014133], ["absolute", 0.03949489155014133], ["recalling", 0.03949489155014133], ["hammered", 0.03949489155014133], ["blacksmiths", 0.03949489155014133], ["reproachfully", 0.03949489155014133], ["rock", 0.03949489155014133], ["commanding", 0.03949489155014133], ["bellows", 0.03949489155014133], ["justice", 0.03949489155014133], ["seething", 0.03949489155014133], ["board", 0.03781272286899878], ["night", 0.03432982284677401], ["banghart", 0.03431421685940323], ["longer", 0.03263204817826069], ["agreement", 0.03263204817826069], ["irritably", 0.03263204817826069], ["confused", 0.03263204817826069], ["swelled", 0.03263204817826069], ["handing", 0.03263204817826069], ["regiment", 0.03263204817826069], ["resumed", 0.03263204817826069], ["reaction", 0.03263204817826069], ["powerful", 0.03263204817826069], ["fidgeted", 0.03263204817826069], ["glare", 0.02861754215738777], ["gratitude", 0.02861754215738777], ["startled", 0.02861754215738777], ["lungs", 0.02861754215738777], ["step", 0.02861754215738777], ["backwards", 0.02861754215738777], ["slept", 0.02861754215738777], ["range", 0.02861754215738777], ["ordered", 0.025769204806380036], ["filled", 0.025769204806380036], ["week", 0.025769204806380036], ["hymn", 0.025769204806380036], ["stay", 0.025769204806380036], ["mine", 0.023559862714160138], ["coffee", 0.023559862714160138], ["sister", 0.023559862714160138], ["situation", 0.023559862714160138], ["motorcycle", 0.021754698785507124], ["table", 0.021754698785507124], ["breakfast", 0.021754698785507124], ["seat", 0.021754698785507124], ["heaven", 0.020228454430781792], ["clock", 0.020228454430781792], ["nice", 0.020228454430781792], ["stopped", 0.020228454430781792], ["ardennes", 0.01890636143449939], ["set", 0.01890636143449939], ["shrugged", 0.01774019276463421], ["minute", 0.01774019276463421], ["nodded", 0.01774019276463421], ["morning", 0.016697019342279493], ["started", 0.015753354195702018], ["three", 0.014891855413626478], ["annie", 0.014628014408845367], ["will", 0.014099353357452849], ["roy", 0.013365611058901147], ["voice", 0.012043518062618745], ["farm", 0.011443274282258003], ["man", 0.009834175970398847], ["room", 0.009834175970398847], ["general", 0.00902581964326508], ["asked", 0.008450394362724007], ["kitty", 0.007236509985572202], ["looked", 0.0068628433718806465], ["time", 0.0068628433718806465], ["good", 0.0068628433718806465], ["hope", 0.002255286444264475], ["haley", 0.001494666454766222]], "sentiment": ["Haley was startled by the reaction his pleasantry had started.

My boss there was one of the toughest guys I ever hope to meet. He had been a lieutenant colonel in public relations in Baltimore. While I was in Schenectady he joined the Dutch Reformed Church, which is a very tough church, indeed.\nHe used to ask me sneeringly sometimes why I hadn\u2019t been an officer, as though I\u2019d done something wrong.\nMy wife and I had lost our baby fat. Those were our scrawny years. We had a lot of scrawny veterans and their scrawny wives for friends. The nicest veterans in Schenectady, I thought, the kindest and funniest ones, the ones who hated war the most, were the ones who\u2019d really fought.\nI wrote the Air Force back then, asking for details about the raid on Dresden, who ordered it, how many planes did it, why they did it, what desirable results there had been and so on. I was answered by a man who, like myself, was in public relations. He said that he was sorry, but that the information was top secret still.\nI read the letter out loud to my wife, and I said, \u201cSecret?

The butler was weeping for joy. He was pointing into a room that Constant could not see. The butler was trying to describe the thing that made him so happy and full of tears. He could not speak. His jaw was palsied, and all he could say to Constant was, \"Putt putt\u2014putt putt putt.\"\nThe floor of the foyer was a mosaic, showing the signs of the zodiac encircling a golden sun.\nWinston Niles Rumfoord, who had materialized only a minute before, came into the foyer and stood on the sun.

he did that he had become a millionaire, with interest-bearing savings accounts under various aliases in banks all over North America, and he had never been arrested for anything. For all he knew, nobody was even trying to catch him. As far as the police were concerned, he reasoned, he was one of seventeen faithless husbands, each with a different name, instead of a single habitual criminal whose real name was James Wait.\nIt is hard to believe nowadays that people could ever have been as brilliantly duplicitous as James Wait\u2014until I remind myself that just about every adult human being back then had a brain weighing about three kilograms! There was no end to the evil schemes that a thought machine that oversized couldn\u2019t imagine and execute.\nSo I raise this question, although there is nobody around to answer it: Can it be doubted that three-kilogram brains were once nearly fatal defects in the evolution of the human race?\nA second query: What source was there back then, save for our overelaborate nervous circuitry, for the evils we were seeing or hearing about simply everywhere?\nMy answer: There was no other source. This was a very innocent planet, except for those great big brains.\n3\nTHE HOTEL EL DORADO was a brand-new, five-story tourist accommodation\u2014built of unadorned cement block. It had the proportions and mood of a glass-front bookcase, high and wide and shallow. Each bedroom had a floor-to-ceiling wall of glass looking westward\u2014toward the waterfront for deep-draft vessels dredged in the delta three kilometers away.\nIn the past, that waterfront had teemed with commerce, and ships from all over the planet had delivered meat and grain and vegetables and fruit and vehicles and clothing and machinery and household appliances, and so on, and carried away, in fair exchange, Ecuadorian coffee and cocoa and sugar and petroleum and gold, and Indian arts and crafts, including \u201cPanama\u201d hats, which had always come from Ecuador and not from Panama.\nBut there were only two ships out there now, as James Wait sat in the bar, nursing a rum and Coca-Cola. He was not a drinker, actually, since he lived by his wits, and could not afford to have the delicate switches of the big computer in his skull short-circuited by alcohol. His drink was a theatrical prop\u2014like the price tag on his ridiculous shirt.\nHe was in no position to judge whether the state of affairs at the waterfront was normal or not. Until two days before, he had never even heard of Guayaquil, and this was the first time in his life he had ever been below the equator. As far as he was concerned, the El Dorado was no different from all the other characterless hostelries he had used as hideouts in the past\u2014in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, in San Ignacio, Mexico, in Watervliet, New York, and on and on.", 0.05010517260517261], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["brain", 0.08728610648774834], ["husband", 0.07184654620318179], ["cherchez", 0.06604004660922486], ["hemorrhage", 0.06604004660922486], ["femme", 0.06604004660922486], ["la", 0.06604004660922486], ["authoritative", 0.06604004660922486], ["scares", 0.06604004660922486], ["energetic", 0.06604004660922486], ["colonels", 0.06604004660922486], ["opinionated", 0.06604004660922486], ["woman", 0.059787160298401955], ["hearing", 0.05737570685222554], ["uninvited", 0.05737570685222554], ["selected", 0.05737570685222554], ["amazing", 0.05737570685222554], ["voluptuous", 0.05737570685222554], ["generals", 0.05737570685222554], ["couldn", 0.05480403188449182], ["biography", 0.05230739300087348], ["abe", 0.05230739300087348], ["writes", 0.05230739300087348], ["nation", 0.05230739300087348], ["career", 0.05230739300087348], ["inspired", 0.05230739300087348], ["pants", 0.045922072703798604], ["bear", 0.045922072703798604], ["surgeon", 0.045922072703798604], ["change", 0.04364305324387417], ["ready", 0.04171616974603344], ["autobiography", 0.04171616974603344], ["empty", 0.04171616974603344], ["moved", 0.04004702733822691], ["marriage", 0.04004702733822691], ["baltimore", 0.03725773294679929], ["forty", 0.036066355699245226], ["absolutely", 0.034978713486874854], ["leave", 0.034978713486874854], ["live", 0.03397817964095565], ["months", 0.03218941909544723], ["help", 0.03218941909544723], ["hell", 0.03218941909544723], ["dear", 0.03138268758122759], ["nice", 0.03138268758122759], ["write", 0.03062487980852216], ["widow", 0.03062487980852216], ["twenty", 0.029910399635522802], ["place", 0.029910399635522802], ["friend", 0.029234559369644354], ["house", 0.0285017250586614], ["army", 0.02740201594224591], ["edith", 0.02740201594224591], ["remember", 0.026314373729875537], ["young", 0.02531383988395633], ["men", 0.02531383988395633], ["years", 0.02316237255120992], ["find", 0.02311520655316053], ["ago", 0.022333702090893855], ["died", 0.021246059878523484], ["work", 0.020570219612645033], ["day", 0.020570219612645033], ["knew", 0.01962039577542101], ["circe", 0.01962039577542101], ["big", 0.019319176380682757], ["three", 0.016411397689823335], ["long", 0.016177746027171428], ["thought", 0.01594838179381897], ["life", 0.015723150475035492], ["good", 0.014860739581448599], ["going", 0.013113715301759116], ["berman", 0.013113715301759116], ["war", 0.012239232944172734]], "sentiment": ["What has inspired this amazing career change by one so old?

laughless jokes, what Freud called gallows humor. There are reallife situations so hopeless that no relief is imaginable.\nWhile we were being bombed in Dresden, sitting in a cellar with our arms over our heads in case the ceiling fell, one soldier said as though he were a duchess in a mansion on a cold and rainy night, \u201cI wonder what the poor people are doing tonight.\u201d Nobody laughed, but we were still all glad he said it. At least we were still alive! He proved it.\n2\nDo you know what a twerp is? When I was in Shortridge High School in Indianapolis 65 years ago, a twerp was a guy who stuck a set of false teeth up his butt and bit the buttons off the back seats of taxicabs. (And a snarf was a guy who sniffed the seats of girls\u2019 bicycles.)\nAnd I consider anybody a twerp who hasn\u2019t read the greatest American short story, which is \u201cOccurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,\u201d by Ambrose Bierce. It isn\u2019t remotely political. It is a flawless example of American genius, like \u201cSophisticated Lady\u201d by Duke Ellington or the Franklin stove.\nI consider anybody a twerp who hasn\u2019t read Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville. There can never be a better book than that one on the strengths and vulnerabilities inherent in our form of government.\nWant a taste of that great book? He says, and he said it 169 years ago, that in no country other than ours has love of money taken a stronger hold on the affections of men.

It was an era of romantic anarchy in publishing which gave us money and mentors, willy-nilly, when we were young\u2014while we learned our craft. Words printed on pages were still the principal form of long-distance communication and stored information in America when we were young.\nNo more.\nNor are there many publishers and editors and agents left who are eager to find some way to get money and other forms of encouragement to young writers who write as clumsily as members of my literary generation did when we started out.

So the old sultan had his court magician take Jenny\u2019s spirit out of her body and put it in a bottle. This he locked up in his treasury.\n\u201cIn 1933,\u201d said George, \u201cLionel O.

He had never fought a fire.\n\"I tell you, boys,\" he went on, \"if those Russian landing barges come barging in some day, and there isn't any way to stop 'em, all the phony bastards who get all the good jobs in this country by kissing ass will be down to meet the conquerers with vodka and caviar, offering to do any kind of work the Russians have in mind. And you know who'll take to the woods with hunting knives and Springfields, who'll go on fighting for a hundred years, by God? The volunteer firemen, that's who.\"\nEliot was locked up in Swarthmore on a drunk and disorderly charge. When he awoke the next morning, the police called his wife. He apologized to her, slunk home.\nBut he was off again in a month, carousing with firemen in Clover Lick, West Virginia, one night, and in New Egypt, New Jersey, the next. And on that trip he traded clothes with another man, swapped a four-hundred-dollar suit for a 1939 double-breasted blue chalkstripe, with shoulders like Gibraltar, lapels like the wings of the Archangel Gabriel, and with the creases in the trousers permanently sewed in.\n\"You must be crazy,\" said the New Egypt fireman.\n\"I don't want to look like me,\" Eliot replied. \"I want to look like you. You're the salt of the earth, by God. You're what's good about America, men in suits like that. You're the soul of the U.S. Infantry.\"\nAnd Eliot eventually traded away everything in his wardrobe but his tails, his dinner jacket, and one gray flannel suit. His sixteen-foot closet became a depressing museum of coveralls, overalls, Robert Hall Easter specials, field jackets, Eisenhower jackets, sweatshirts and so on. Sylvia wanted to burn them, but Eliot told her, \"Burn my tails, my dinner jacket and my gray flannel suit instead.\"\nEliot was a flamboyantly sick man, even then, but there was no one to hustle him off for treatment, and no one was as yet entranced by the profits to be made in proving him insane. Little Norman Mushari was only twelve in those troubled days, was assembling plastic model airplanes, masturbating, and papering his room with pictures of Senator Joe Mc-Carthy and Roy Cohn. Eliot Rosewater was the farthest thing from his mind.\nSylvia, raised among rich and charming eccentrics, was too European to have him put away. And the Senator was in the political fight of his life, rallying the Republican forces of reaction that had been shattered by the election of Dwight David Eisenhower. When told of his son's bizarre way of life, the Senator refused to worry, on the grounds that the boy was well-bred. \"He's got fiber, he's got spine,\" the Senator said. \"He's experimenting. He'll come back to his senses any time he's good and ready. This family never produced and never will produce a chronic drunk or a chronic lunatic.\"\nHaving said that, he went into the Senate Chamber to deliver his fairly famous speech on the Golden Age of Rome, in which he said, in part:", 0.039101903387617654], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["hapgood", 0.193066570725444], ["claycomb", 0.13098852220011542], ["judge", 0.09853284746260968], ["moon", 0.096617587626895], ["kingdom", 0.08732568146674362], ["righteousness", 0.08732568146674362], ["receive", 0.08732568146674362], ["problems", 0.08732568146674362], ["powers", 0.07943212034028478], ["sermon", 0.07586870327567014], ["court", 0.07389963559695725], ["mount", 0.06916680066231204], ["alcohol", 0.05770982247123857], ["heaven", 0.04926642373130484], ["labor", 0.046252844280165094], ["choose", 0.04366284073337181], ["peacemakers", 0.04366284073337181], ["prediction", 0.04366284073337181], ["pornography", 0.04366284073337181], ["fascinated", 0.04366284073337181], ["persecuted", 0.04366284073337181], ["adventures", 0.04366284073337181], ["comforted", 0.04366284073337181], ["taboo", 0.04366284073337181], ["adjourned", 0.04366284073337181], ["mercifully", 0.04366284073337181], ["meek", 0.04366284073337181], ["hungered", 0.04366284073337181], ["remember", 0.03955094166680701], ["schools", 0.03793435163783507], ["unmarried", 0.03793435163783507], ["presumably", 0.03793435163783507], ["final", 0.03793435163783507], ["sufferings", 0.03793435163783507], ["unselfish", 0.03793435163783507], ["mourned", 0.03793435163783507], ["inherit", 0.03793435163783507], ["derring", 0.03458340033115602], ["encouraged", 0.03458340033115602], ["inspired", 0.03458340033115602], ["remains", 0.03458340033115602], ["distinguished", 0.03458340033115602], ["high", 0.03284903905344892], ["days", 0.03224792096797991], ["gathered", 0.03220586254229833], ["sake", 0.03220586254229833], ["treated", 0.03220586254229833], ["merciful", 0.03220586254229833], ["pure", 0.03220586254229833], ["tales", 0.03220586254229833], ["sons", 0.030361700961189158], ["spirit", 0.030361700961189158], ["pretty", 0.028854911235619285], ["homes", 0.028854911235619285], ["god", 0.028093963475733532], ["christ", 0.02758093867506343], ["character", 0.02758093867506343], ["classmate", 0.02758093867506343], ["earth", 0.026477373446761595], ["telling", 0.02550395992894024], ["lunch", 0.02550395992894024], ["jesus", 0.02550395992894024], ["stories", 0.02550395992894024], ["education", 0.02550395992894024], ["exactly", 0.02463321186565242], ["sir", 0.02463321186565242], ["serious", 0.02463321186565242], ["father", 0.024042352599155263], ["question", 0.02384552442925304], ["fine", 0.023126422140082547], ["easily", 0.023126422140082547], ["married", 0.023126422140082547], ["school", 0.021852449579526697], ["heart", 0.021282260558973375], ["live", 0.019775470833403506], ["book", 0.019775470833403506], ["nice", 0.019775470833403506], ["history", 0.019328634293979737], ["poor", 0.019328634293979737], ["public", 0.01774966539511437], ["family", 0.01739793304454581], ["called", 0.01673642306377278], ["sort", 0.015833949576458797], ["morning", 0.014519365323320887], ["son", 0.013820543934659207], ["find", 0.013600145198442997], ["turned", 0.013600145198442997], ["asked", 0.010696030431187721], ["people", 0.007143496867284221], ["man", 0.005439924921105103]], "sentiment": ["It turned out that he had been telling stories all morning in court, too.

in the depths again as he climbed into his car in front of Building 58. There was nothing in sight to divert him, nothing but asphalt, a perspective of blank, numbered fa\u00e7ades, and wisps of cold cirrus clouds in a strip of blue sky. Paul glimpsed the only life visible through a narrow canyon between Buildings 57 and 59, a canyon that opened onto the river and revealed a bank of gray porches in Homestead. On the topmost porch an old man rocked in a patch of sunlight. A child leaned over the railing and launched a square of paper in a lazy, oscillating course to the river\u2019s edge. The youngster looked up from the paper to meet Paul\u2019s gaze. The old man stopped rocking and looked, too, at the curiosity, a living thing in the Ilium Works.\nAs Paul passed Katharine Finch\u2019s desk on his way into his office, she held out his typewritten speech. \u201cThat\u2019s very good, what you said about the Second Industrial Revolution,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOld, old stuff.\u201d\n\u201cIt seemed very fresh to me\u2014I mean that part where you say how the First Industrial Revolution devalued muscle work, then the second one devalued routine mental work. I was fascinated.\u201d\n\u201cNorbert Wiener, a mathematician, said all that way back in the nineteen-forties. It\u2019s fresh to you because you\u2019re too young to know anything but the way things are now.\u201d\n\u201cActually, it is kind of incredible that things were ever any other way, isn\u2019t it? It was so ridiculous to have people stuck in one place all day, just using their senses, then a reflex, using their senses, then a reflex, and not really thinking at all.\u201d\n\u201cExpensive,\u201d said Paul, \u201cand about as reliable as a putty ruler. You can imagine what the scrap heap looked like, and what hell it was to be a service manager in those days. Hangovers, family squabbles, resentments against the boss, debts, the war\u2014every kind of human trouble was likely to show up in a product one way or another.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd happiness, too. I can remember when we had to allow for holidays, especially around Christmas. There wasn\u2019t anything to do but take it. The reject rate would start climbing around the fifth of December, and up and up it\u2019d go until Christmas.

All I\u2019ve done is stumble on a trick that\u2019s always been waiting to be performed. It was an accident, like most discoveries, and none other than Henry Bowers is the lucky one.\u201d\nEllen clapped her hands. \u201cOh, Henry, they\u2019ll make a movie of it someday!\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Russians\u2019ll claim they invented it,\u201d laughed Henry. \u201cWell, let \u2019em. I\u2019ll be big about it. I\u2019ll divide up the market with \u2019em. I\u2019ll be satisfied with a mere billion dollars from American sales.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Ellen was lost in the delight of seeing in her imagination a movie about her famous husband, played by an actor that looked very much like Lincoln. She watched the simple-hearted counter of blessings, slightly down at the heels, humming and working on a tiny microphone with which he hoped to measure the minute noises inside the human ear. In the background, colleagues played cards and joshed him for working during the lunch hour. Then he placed the microphone in his ear, connected it to an amplifier and loudspeaker, and was astonished by Confido\u2019s first whispers on earth:\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never get anywhere around here, Henry,\u201d the first, primitive Confido had said. \u201cThe only people who get ahead at Accousti-gem, boy, are the backslappers and snow-job artists. Every day somebody gets a big raise for something you did. Wise up! You\u2019ve got ten times as much on the ball as anybody else in the whole laboratory. It isn\u2019t fair.\u201d\nWhat Henry had done after that was to connect the microphone to a hearing aid instead of a loudspeaker. He fixed the microphone on the earpiece, so that the small voice, whatever it was, was picked up by the microphone, and played back louder by the hearing aid. And there, in Henry\u2019s trembling hands, was Confido, everybody\u2019s best friend, ready for market.\n\u201cI mean it,\u201d said the new Henry to Ellen. \u201cA cool billion! That\u2019s a six-dollar profit on a Confido for every man, woman, and child in the United States.\u201d\n\u201cI wish we knew what the voice was,\u201d said Ellen. \u201cI mean, it makes you wonder.\u201d She felt a fleeting uneasiness.\nHenry waved the question away as he sat down to eat. \u201cSomething to do with the way the brain and the ears are hooked up,\u201d he said with his mouth full. \u201cPlenty of time to find that out. The thing now is to get Confidos on the market, and start living instead of merely existing.\u201d\n\u201cIs it us?\u201d said Ellen. \u201cThe voice\u2014is it us?\u201d", 0.14391905162738494], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["debs", 0.1484580070921061], ["benjamin", 0.07280503177141946], ["000s", 0.06651875102555645], ["14", 0.062058563855761396], ["jesus", 0.062058563855761396], ["socialist", 0.05859897391290543], ["officer", 0.05577228310989839], ["christ", 0.05577228310989839], ["wills", 0.05338235008932073], ["indiana", 0.05131209594010333], ["heart", 0.04948600236403537], ["eugene", 0.04502581519424032], ["haute", 0.04177574984353877], ["votes", 0.04177574984353877], ["1940", 0.04177574984353877], ["groundskeeper", 0.04177574984353877], ["planted", 0.04177574984353877], ["anticipated", 0.04177574984353877], ["inferiors", 0.04177574984353877], ["pacifist", 0.04177574984353877], ["venus", 0.04177574984353877], ["bleeding", 0.04177574984353877], ["1926", 0.04177574984353877], ["terre", 0.04177574984353877], ["joy", 0.04177574984353877], ["1948", 0.04177574984353877], ["numerology", 0.04177574984353877], ["almighty", 0.04177574984353877], ["mars", 0.04177574984353877], ["commissioned", 0.04177574984353877], ["namesake", 0.04177574984353877], ["presidency", 0.04177574984353877], ["abrupt", 0.04177574984353877], ["behest", 0.04177574984353877], ["organizer", 0.04177574984353877], ["2000", 0.04177574984353877], ["states", 0.0396257114071362], ["united", 0.0396257114071362], ["grandfather", 0.03873953444837731], ["nominated", 0.03640251588570973], ["uttered", 0.03640251588570973], ["candidate", 0.03640251588570973], ["humiliating", 0.03640251588570973], ["conclude", 0.03640251588570973], ["butler", 0.03640251588570973], ["dishonorable", 0.03640251588570973], ["indianapolis", 0.03325937551277822], ["element", 0.03325937551277822], ["died", 0.03303837506658944], ["age", 0.03188941425800461], ["event", 0.031029281927880698], ["superior", 0.031029281927880698], ["negative", 0.031029281927880698], ["flag", 0.031029281927880698], ["maternal", 0.031029281927880698], ["heavily", 0.029299486956452715], ["criminal", 0.029299486956452715], ["35", 0.029299486956452715], ["america", 0.029299486956452715], ["third", 0.029299486956452715], ["2001", 0.029299486956452715], ["will", 0.027568276235229092], ["21", 0.026691175044660367], ["labor", 0.026691175044660367], ["colonel", 0.026691175044660367], ["lower", 0.026691175044660367], ["year", 0.026359570165931236], ["atheist", 0.025656047970051665], ["professional", 0.025656047970051665], ["lieutenant", 0.024743001182017686], ["honor", 0.024743001182017686], ["soul", 0.024743001182017686], ["party", 0.024743001182017686], ["1", 0.02400843960760254], ["8", 0.02318741439548938], ["years", 0.023130757561489815], ["luck", 0.021892421491123755], ["god", 0.021892421491123755], ["famous", 0.021317941086831334], ["hartke", 0.020783112625692178], ["ordered", 0.020783112625692178], ["born", 0.0198128557035681], ["named", 0.0198128557035681], ["university", 0.019369767224188653], ["soldier", 0.01817480071389983], ["free", 0.015944707129002304], ["times", 0.015672681394031215], ["army", 0.015155693994816703], ["history", 0.015155693994816703], ["killed", 0.014909580054393598], ["class", 0.014909580054393598], ["american", 0.013996533266359619], ["great", 0.013179785082965618], ["country", 0.012096359173080665], ["war", 0.010299447436202182], ["lot", 0.009782460036987668], ["knew", 0.009782460036987668], ["thought", 0.00851637433076054], ["vietnam", 0.0078065511251365835], ["prison", 0.00733659281648205], ["time", 0.005698537826813779], ["people", 0.005267763786854005]], "sentiment": ["1\nMY NAME IS Eugene Debs Hartke, and I was born in 1940. I was named at the behest of my maternal grandfather, Benjamin Wills, who was a Socialist and an Atheist, and nothing but a groundskeeper at Butler University, in Indianapolis, Indiana, in honor of Eugene Debs of Terre Haute, Indiana. Debs was a Socialist and a Pacifist and a Labor Organizer who ran several times for the Presidency of the United States of America, and got more votes than has any other candidate nominated by a third party in the history of this country.\nDebs died in 1926, when I was a negative 14 years of age.\nThe year is 2001 now.\nIf all had gone the way a lot of people thought it would, Jesus Christ would have been among us again, and the American flag would have been planted on Venus and Mars.\nNo such luck!\nAT LEAST THE World will end, an event anticipated with great joy by many. It will end very soon, but not in the year 2000, which has come and gone. From that I conclude that God Almighty is not heavily into Numerology.\nGRANDFATHER BENJAMIN WILLS died in 1948, when I was a plus 8 years of age, but not before he made sure that I knew by heart the most famous words uttered by Debs, which are:\n\u201cWhile there is a lower class I am in it. While there is a criminal element I am of it. While there is a soul in prison I am not free.\u201d\nI, DEBS\u2019 NAMESAKE, however, became anything but a bleeding heart.

The explosion came from the general direction of the closely guarded Air Force experimental station in the forest ten miles northwest of Elkmont.\nSaid the Air Force Office of Public Information, \u201cNo comment.\u201d\nThat evening, amateur astronomers in Omaha, Nebraska, and Glenwood, Iowa, reported independently that a speck had crossed the face of the full moon at 9:57 p.m. There was a flurry of excitement on the news wires. Astronomers at the major North American observatories denied that they had seen it.\nThey lied.\nIn Boston, on the morning of Thursday, July 27th, an enterprising newsman sought out Dr. Bernard Groszinger, youthful rocket consultant for the Air Force. \u201cIs it possible that what crossed the moon was a spaceship?\u201d the newsman asked.\nDr. Groszinger laughed at the question. \u201cMy own opinion is that we\u2019re beginning another cycle of flying-saucer scares,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time everyone\u2019s seeing spaceships between us and the moon.

I was anything other than \u201cmissing in action.\u201d Chances are that you also failed to receive any of the letters I wrote from Germany. That leaves me a lot of explaining to do -- in precis:\nI\u2019ve been a prisoner of war since December 19th, 1944, when our division was cut to ribbons by Hitler\u2019s last desperate thrust through Luxemburg and Belgium. Seven Fanatical Panzer Divisions hit us and out us off from the rest of Hodges\u2019 First Army. The other American Divisions on our flanks managed to pull out: We were obliged to stay and fight. Bayonets aren't much good against tanks: Our ammunition, food and medical supplies gave out and our casualties out-numbered those who could still fight - so we gave up. The 106th got a presidential Citation and some British Decoration from Montgomery for it, I\u2019m told, but I\u2019ll be damned if it was worth it. I was one of the few who weren\u2019t wounded. For that much thank God.\nWell, the supermen marched us, without food, water or sleep to Limberg, a distance of about sixty miles, I think, where we were loaded and locked up, sixty men to each small, unventilated, unheated box car. There were no sanitary accommodations -- the floors were covered with fresh cow dung. There wasn\u2019t room for all of us to lie down. Half slept while the other half stood. We spent several days, including Christmas, on that Limberg siding. On Christmas eve the Royal Air Force bombed and strafed our unmarked train. They killed about one-hundred-and-fifty of us. We got a little water Christmas Day and moved slowly across Germany to a large P.O.W. Camp in Muhlburg, South of Berlin. We were released from the box cars on New Year\u2019s Day. The Germans herded us through scalding delousing showers. Many men died from shock in the showers after ten days of starvation, thirst and exposure. But I didn\u2019t.\nUnder the Geneva Convention, Officers and Non-commissioned Officers are not obliged to work when taken prisoner. I am, as you know, a Private. One-hundred-and-fifty such minor beings were shipped to a Dresden work camp on January 10th. I was their leader by virtue of the little German I spoke. It was our misfortune to have sadistic and fanatical guards. We were refused medical attention and clothing: We were given long hours at extremely hard labor. Our food ration was two-hundred-and-fifty grams of black bread and one pint of unseasoned potato soup each day. After desperately trying to improve our situation for two months and having been met with bland smiles I told the guards just what I was going to do to them when the Russians came. They beat me up a little. I was fired as group leader. Beatings were very small time: -- one boy starved to death and the SS Troops shot two for stealing food.\nOn about February 14th the Americans came over, followed by the R.A.F. their combined labors killed 250,000 people in twenty-four hours and destroyed all of Dresden -- possibly the world\u2019s most beautiful city. But not me.\nAfter that we were put to work carrying corpses from Air-Raid shelters; women, children, old men; dead from concussion, fire or suffocation. Civilians cursed us and threw rocks as we carried bodies to huge funeral pyres in the city.\nWhen General Patton took Leipzig we were evacuated on foot to Hellexisdorf on the Saxony-Czechoslovakian border. There we remained until the war ended. Our guards deserted us. On that happy day the Russians were intent on mopping up isolated outlaw resistance in our sector. Their planes (P-39\u2019s) strafed and bombed us, killing fourteen but not me.\nEight of us stole a team and wagon. we traveled and looted our way through Sudetenland and Saxony for eight days, living like kings. The Russians are crazy about Americans. The Russians picked us up in Dresden. We rode from there to the American lines at Halle in Lend-Lease Ford trucks. We\u2019ve since been flown to Le Havre.", -0.033511232775938656], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
