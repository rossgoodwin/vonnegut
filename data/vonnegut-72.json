His work would have special resonance for the dynamic new youth culture and its values, especially in questioning the status quo and challenging the accepted wisdom (though Kurt did it through storytelling rather than the usual political or cultural manifestos). The two most specific and significant events of importance to Vonnegut, though, were his being invited to teach at the highly regarded Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop at the University of Iowa and his offer of a three-book contract from publisher Seymour Lawrence, which gave him financial freedom to devote himself full time to his writing.\nVonnegut was interviewed in October of 1966 by the noted academic critic Robert Scholes, while Scholes was teaching in the English department of the University of Iowa and Vonnegut was teaching at the Writers\u2019 Workshop. Scholes was the first and most perceptive academic critic to write about Vonnegut\u2019s work. In The Fabulators, a 1967 study considering Vonnegut along with critically acclaimed novelists like Lawrence Durrell and Iris Murdoch, Scholes explained that Vonnegut \u201cuses the rhetorical potential of the short sentence and short paragraph better than anyone now writing, often getting a rich comic or dramatic effect by isolating a single sentence in a separate paragraph or excerpting a phrase from context for a bizarre chapter-heading.

\u201cIt\u2019s a she. She only looks dead. We don\u2019t have to do anything. She hasn\u2019t been taking her pills. Her niece will be here in a minute to pick her up.\u201d\nHere is additional clinical information about Martha Jones that might have been interesting, but surely not useful at that point in time, as the three men stood around in the Calvin with their thumbs up their asses, so to speak, waiting for the niece to arrive: Martha Jones had been born with ambiguous sexual organs and glands and musculature. These things happen. Several such persons had elected to compete as female athletes with great success. Martha Jones had elected to overeat and go nuts in muumuus instead.\nCHAPTER 4\nThe following is a transcript of a recording of what Gilbert Lanz Berman said to a psychiatrist five years his junior, post\u2013Taj Mahal, during his second stay at Caldwell, after he had been there a week. This was the first of two sessions. He would fire her after the second one. She was Dr. Helen Newman Klein, whose office was in nearby Milwaukee. She would come to Caldwell, which had no resident psychiatrist, but only internists and dieticians and psy-chopharmacologists and aerobics instructors and psychiatric social workers and the like, at the request of patients, like Berman, who wanted and could afford to pay for seriously probing talk therapy that might deal with life problems beyond mere substance abuse. Dr. Klein was an absolute knockout\u2014great body, great smile.\nAfter Berman fired her, she would opine that Berman, rich as Croesus, had summoned a psychiatrist so he could tease her for his own amusement and cajole her into prescribing a sleeping pill, Desamol, that they wouldn\u2019t give him at Caldwell.\nShe said to a Milwaukee colleague, Dr. Walter Streit, who was on his way out to Caldwell to take over Berman\u2019s case, \u201cI hope your pockets are full of Desamol, and you know what the fundamental illness of stand-up comedians is.\u201d Dr. Streit said he didn\u2019t know but that he hoped to find out, and she said, \u201cIngratitude.\u201d\nSo here we go, with \u201cB\u201d for Berman and \u201cK\u201d for Klein: K: How do you do, Mr. Berman? I\u2019m Dr. Klein.\nB: Do have a seat, Doc. Take a load off your feet. I keep thinking today is Tuesday.\nK: Today is Tuesday.\nB: That\u2019s what I keep thinking.

The footprints of a man led away from it for a distance of forty feet, then stopped.\nIt was as though Malachi Constant had walked forty feet, and had then dissolved into thin air.\nOn the following Tuesday, the space ship known as The Whale was rechristened The Rumfoord and was readied for firing.\nBeatrice Rumfoord smugly watched the ceremonies on a television set two thousand miles away. She was still in Newport. The Rumfoord was going to be fired in exactly one minute. If destiny was going to get Beatrice Rumfoord on board, it was going to have to do it in one hell of a hurry.\nBeatrice was feeling marvelous. She had proved so many good things. She had proved that she was mistress of her own fate, could say no whenever she pleased\u2014and make it stick. She had proved that her husband\u2019s omniscient bullying was all a bluff\u2014that he wasn\u2019t much better at forecasts than the United States Weather Bureau.\nShe had, moreover, worked out a plan that would enable her to live in modest comfort for the rest of her days, and would, at the same time, give her husband the treatment he deserved. The next time he materialized, he would find the estate teeming with gawkers. Beatrice was going to charge them five dollars a head to come in through the Alice-in-Wonderland door.\nThis was no pipe dream. She had discussed it with two supposed representatives of the mortgage-holders on the estate\u2014and they were enthusiastic.\nThey were with her now, watching the preparations for the firing of The Rumfoord on television. The television set was in the same room with the huge painting of Beatrice as an immaculate little girl in white, with a white pony all her own. Beatrice smiled up at the painting. The little girl had yet to get the least bit soiled.\nThe television announcer now began the last minute\u2019s countdown for the firing of The Rumfoord.", 0.17183441558441556], "title": "The Sirens

He had not been told otherwise. Since he had been back in Ecuador for only an hour, and still had a bellyful of good New York food and a champagne headache, it had yet to dawn on him what awful trouble he and his ship were in.\nThere is another human defect which the Law of Natural Selection has yet to remedy: When people of today have full bellies, they are exactly like their ancestors of a million years ago: very slow to acknowledge any awful troubles they may be in. Then is when they forget to keep a sharp lookout for sharks and whales.\nThis was a particularly tragic flaw a million years ago, since the people who were best informed about the state of the planet, like *Andrew MacIntosh, for example, and rich and powerful enough to slow down all the waste and destruction going on, were by definition well fed.\nSo everything was always just fine as far as they were concerned.\nFor all the computers and measuring instruments and news gatherers and evaluators and memory banks and libraries and experts on this and that at their disposal, their deaf and blind bellies remained the final judges of how urgent this or that problem, such as the destruction of North America\u2019s and Europe\u2019s forests by acid rain, say, might really be.\nAnd here was the sort of advice a full belly gave and still gives, and which the Captain\u2019s full belly gave him when the first mate of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, Hernando Cruz, told him that none of the guides had shown up or been heard from, and that a third of the crewmen had deserted so far, feeling that they had better look after their families: \u201cBe patient. Smile. Be confident. Everything will turn out for the best somehow.\u201d\n24\nMARY HEPBURN had seen and appreciated the Captain\u2019s comical performance on The Tonight Show, and then another one on Good Morning America. To that extent, she felt she already knew him some before her big brain made her come to Guayaquil.\nHe was on The Tonight Show two weeks after Roy died, and he was the first person to make her laugh out loud after that sad event. There she was in the living room of her little house, with the houses on all sides of hers empty and for sale, and heard herself laugh out loud about the ridiculous Ecuadorian submarine fleet, whose tradition was to go underwater and never come up again.\nShe supposed then that von Kleist was a lot like Roy in loving nature and machinery. Otherwise, why would he have been chosen to be the Captain of the Bah\u00eda de Darwin?", 0.09012771950271949], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["office", 0.2615369650043674], ["papering", 0.16510011652306214], ["paperhanger", 0.16510011652306214], ["paperhangers", 0.16510011652306214], ["better", 0.12656919941978165], ["minute", 0.12177841773806557], ["doctor", 0.1148051817594965], ["beat", 0.1148051817594965], ["shook", 0.1148051817594965], ["heads", 0.10910763310968542], ["truth", 0.1042904243650836], ["professional", 0.1042904243650836], ["wonderful", 0.08494544910238912], ["hope", 0.08494544910238912], ["paper", 0.08262957497258532], ["daughter", 0.07845671895306898], ["met", 0.0765621995213054], ["turned", 0.074775999088807], ["painters", 0.07308639842411088], ["job", 0.07308639842411088], ["friend", 0.07308639842411088], ["close", 0.06995879034420517], ["celeste", 0.06578593432468884], ["berman", 0.06556857650879558], ["called", 0.06210521446042686], ["husband", 0.05987212183598483], ["cook", 0.05881269834611978], ["house", 0.03562715632332675], ["told", 0.0351350201680724]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI\u2019m just the cook,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI also hope you\u2019re my friend,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThink what you want,\u201d she said.

embarrassed. They couldn\u2019t stand it that even one American, even a black one, would think for even a minute that maybe America wasn\u2019t the best country in the world.\u201d\nI asked him if he had ever heard of Dr. Robert Fender, who was convicted of treason during the Korean War, and was right inside the prison there, measuring Virgil Greathouse for a uniform.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI never kept track of other people in that kind of trouble. I never felt like it was a club or something.\u201d\nI asked him if he had ever seen the legendary Mrs. Jack Graham, Jr., the majority stockholder in The RAMJAC Corporation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s like asking me if I\u2019ve seen God,\u201d he said.\nThe widow Graham had not been seen in public, at that point, for about five years. Her most recent appearance was in a courtroom in New York City, where RAMJAC was being sued by a group of its stockholders for proofs that she was still alive. The accounts in the papers amused my wife so, I remember. \u201cThis is the America I love,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be like this all the time?\u201d\nMrs. Graham came into the courtroom without a lawyer, but with eight uniformed bodyguards from Pinkerton, Inc., a RAMJAC subsidiary. One of them was carrying an amplifier with a loudspeaker and a microphone. Mrs. Graham was wearing a voluminous black caftan with its hood up, and with the hood pinned shut with diaper pins, so that she could peek out, but nobody could see what was inside. Only her hands were visible. Another Pinkerton was carrying an inkpad, some paper, and a copy of her fingerprints from the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Her prints had been forwarded to the F.B.I. after she was convicted of drunken driving in Frankfort, Kentucky, in Nineteen-hundred and Fifty-two, soon after her husband died. She had been put on probation at that time. I myself had just been fired from government service at that time.\nThe amplifier was turned on, and the microphone was slipped inside her caftan, so people could hear what she was saying in there. She proved she was who she said she was by fingerprinting herself on the spot and having the prints compared with those possessed by the F.B.I. She said under oath that she was in excellent health, both physically and mentally\u2014and in control of the company\u2019s top officers, but never face-to-face. When she instructed them on the telephone, she used a password to identify herself. This password was changed at irregular intervals. At the judge\u2019s request, I remember, she gave a sample password, and it seemed so full of magic that it still sticks in my mind. This was it: \u201cshoemaker.\u201d Every order she gave on the phone was subsequently confirmed by mail, by a letter written entirely by her own hand. At the bottom of each letter was not only her signature, but a full set of prints from her eight little fingers and two little thumbs. She called them that: \u201c\u2026 my eight little fingers and my two little thumbs.\u201d\nThat was that. Mrs. Jack Graham was unquestionably alive, and now she was free to disappear again.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Mr. Leen many times,\u201d said Cleveland Lawes. He was speaking of Arpad Leen, the very public and communicative president and chairman of the board of directors of The RAMJAC Corporation. He would become my boss of bosses, and Cleveland Lawes\u2019s boss of bosses, too, when we both became corporate officers of RAMJAC. I say now that Arpad Leen is the most able and informed and brilliant and responsive executive under whom it has ever been my privilege to serve.

Although Margaret and her mother read to each other a lot, taking turns, and usually by flashlight in a tent they\u2019d made inside the house out of bedspreads and chairs or whatever, they never read a newspaper. They didn\u2019t like television, either, except for Sesame Street, which was supposedly for children. The only time they saw Jason Wilder on the little screen as far as I can remember, my mother-in-law started dancing to him as though he were modern music.\nWhen one of his guests on the show said something, she froze. Only when Wilder spoke did she start to dance again.\nI certainly wasn\u2019t going to tell him that.\n\u201cI WANT TO say first,\u201d said Wilder, \u201cthat I am in nothing less than awe, Professor Hartke, of your magnificent record in the Vietnam War. If the American people had not lost their courage and ceased to support you, we would be living in a very different and much better world, and especially in Asia. I know, too, of your kindness and understanding toward your wife and her mother, to which I am glad to apply the same encomium your behavior earned in Vietnam, \u2018beyond the call of duty.\u2019 So I am sorry to have to warn you that the story I am about to tell you may not be nearly as simple or easy to refute as my daughter may have led you to expect.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever it is, sir,\u201d I said, \u201clet\u2019s hear it.

He said that several of his friends had attended Tarkington or sent their children here, so that he was favorably impressed with the institution\u2019s successes with the learning-disabled long before he entrusted his own daughter to us. An usher and a bridesmaid at his wedding, he said, had earned Associate in the Arts and Sciences Degrees in Scipio. The usher had gone on to be Ambassador to Iceland. The bridesmaid was on the Board of Directors of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\nHe felt that Tarkington\u2019s highly unconventional techniques would be useful if applied to the country\u2019s notoriously beleaguered inner-city schools, and he planned to say so after he had learned more about them. The ratio of teachers to students at Tarkington, incidentally, was then 1 to 6. In inner-city schools, that ratio was then 1 to 65.\nThere was a big campaign back then, I remember, to get the Japanese to buy up inner-city public schools the way they were buying up prisons and hospitals. But they were too smart. They wouldn\u2019t touch schools for unwelcome children of unwelcome parents with a 10-foot pole.\nHE SAID HE hoped to write a book about Tarkington called \u201cLittle Miracle on Lake Mohiga\u201d or \u201cTeaching the Unteachable.\u201d So he wired his daughter for sound and told her to follow the best teachers in order to record what they said and how they said it. \u201cI wanted to learn what it was that made them good, Professor Hartke, without their knowing they were being studied,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted them to go on being whatever they were, warts and all, without any self-consciousness.\u201d\nThis was the first I heard of the tapes. That chilling news explained Kimberley\u2019s lurking, lurking, lurking all the time. Wilder spared me the suspense, at least, of wondering what all of Kimberley\u2019s apparatus might have overheard. He punched the playback button on the recorder before him, and I heard myself telling Paul Slazinger, privately, I\u2019d thought, that the two principal currencies of the planet were the Yen and fellatio. This was so early in the academic year that classes hadn\u2019t begun yet! This was during Freshman Orientation Week, and I had just told the incoming Class of 1994 that merchants and tradespeople in the town below preferred to be paid in Japanese Yen rather than dollars, so that the freshmen might want their parents to give them their allowances in Yen.", 0.1373349567099567], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["knights", 0.13254000358556564],

But Plummer was off and away.\nTemporarily relieved until next challenge day, Mr. Helmholtz sat down to enjoy his paper, to read that the treasurer of the Knights of Kandahar, a respected citizen, had disappeared with the organization\u2019s funds, leaving behind and unpaid the Knights\u2019 bills for the past year and a half. \u201cWe\u2019ll pay a hundred cents on the dollar, if we have to sell everything but the Sacred Mace,\u201d the Sublime Chamberlain of the Inner Shrine had said.\nMr. Helmholtz didn\u2019t know any of the people involved, and he yawned and turned to the funnies. He gasped, turned to the front page again. He looked up a number in the phone book and dialed.\n\u201cZum-zum-zum-zum,\u201d went the busy signal in his ear. He dropped the telephone into its cradle. Hundreds of people, he thought, must be trying to get in touch with the Sublime Chamberlain of the Inner Shrine of the Knights of Kandahar at this moment. He looked up at his flaking ceiling in prayer. But none of them, he prayed, was after a bargain in a cart-borne bass drum.\nHe dialed again and again, and always got the busy signal. He walked out on his porch to relieve some of the tension building up in him. He would be the only one bidding on the drum, he told himself, and he could name his price. Good Lord! If he offered fifty dollars for it, he could probably have it! He\u2019d put up his own money, and get the school to pay him back in three years, when the plumes with the electric lights in them were paid for in full.\nHe was laughing like a department store Santa Claus, when his gaze dropped from heaven to his lawn and he espied Plummet\u2019s undelivered newspapers lying beneath the shrubbery.", 0.10978458049886623], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["driver", 0.13635604776271845], ["aluminum", 0.11012269023737624], ["stone", 0.09596292574472728], ["siding", 0.08934954476882427], ["houses", 0.0800285078008205], ["distance", 0.07070747083281671], ["despaired", 0.06060919032831893], ["competitive", 0.06060919032831893], ["depend", 0.06060919032831893], ["embittered", 0.06060919032831893], ["misinformed", 0.06060919032831893], ["plastering", 0.06060919032831893], ["break", 0.06060919032831893], ["determination", 0.06060919032831893], ["hesitated", 0.06060919032831893], ["sighed", 0.06060919032831893], ["salaciously", 0.06060919032831893], ["scolded", 0.06060919032831893], ["hand", 0.05748070888101071], ["businesses", 0.05264198135636553], ["rig", 0.05264198135636553], ["perma", 0.05264198135636553], ["technique", 0.05264198135636553], ["freshly", 0.05264198135636553], ["stay", 0.05264198135636553], ["god", 0.04815967191300692], ["yeah", 0.04798146287236364], ["wood", 0.04798146287236364], ["sides", 0.04798146287236364], ["stranger", 0.04798146287236364], ["involved", 0.04798146287236364], ["sheets", 0.044674772384412136], ["forgot", 0.044674772384412136], ["shrugged", 0.044674772384412136], ["laid", 0.044674772384412136], ["cement", 0.044674772384412136], ["colored", 0.044674772384412136], ["determined", 0.044674772384412136], ["trout", 0.0431908939216639], ["talked", 0.04001425390041025], ["damn", 0.04001425390041025], ["scheme", 0.04001425390041025], ["storm", 0.04001425390041025], ["painting", 0.03824240700584406], ["cohoes", 0.036707563412458746], ["painted", 0.036707563412458746], ["windows", 0.036707563412458746], ["worked", 0.035353735416408356], ["needed", 0.03414269500654828], ["forgotten", 0.03414269500654828], ["looked", 0.03388069370397778], ["easy", 0.0330471756984526], ["face", 0.0330471756984526], ["days", 0.03112701380577253], ["making", 0.026765064131003522], ["talk", 0.026765064131003522], ["truck", 0.026175486034594894], ["times", 0.02407983595650346], ["story", 0.023610617628684438], ["country", 0.023610617628684438], ["instance", 0.023159804833819134], ["kilgore", 0.021965780345458305], ["wanted", 0.016854449066591115], ["life", 0.015415792251027826], ["time", 0.008760230483297663]], "sentiment": ["Trout shrugged.\nThe truck driver became embittered by Trout, scolded him for being so salaciously misinformed. \u201cLet me tell you, Kilgore\u2014\u201d he hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s your name, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Trout.
