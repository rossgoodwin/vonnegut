Bound feet and six-inch fingernails wouldn\u2019t have restricted her activities in the least.\nPaul sat down on a wicker chair in the cool blue shadows of the Administration Building\u2019s porch and rested his feet on the peeling bark of the log railing to wait.\nNow the lights along the walks blinked on and off, a silent signal, warning that the last boat was about to leave for the island.\nThere was laughing, and quick crunching in the gravel, and a couple ran from the woods toward the dock. Their insistence on keeping their arms about each other\u2019s waists made their progress as graceless as a sack race. This annoyed Paul as a critic. It was painful to watch a clumsily conducted mating rite, knowing, from long experience with the skilled Anita, how much like a dance it could be when done properly.\nThere\u2014she was making him slow down now, and their gait through the trees, against the moon, was more orderly. Paul had been sure that the farewell kiss would be an ungainly business, but, all credit to her, they stopped, and took the time and stances to do it right. Good.\nPaul watched them with increasing identification with the man. Paul had always been a petty thief of others\u2019 high moments, and his hunger for this particular sort of moment was acute.
