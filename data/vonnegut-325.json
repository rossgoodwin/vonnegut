I lectured at the New College down there a few months back, and asked the audience if there was anyone who knew how John was. I was told by an older man that he was much better, and I was glad to hear it.\nI enclose two quite acceptable obituaries which you may not have seen. I first heard of John\u2019s death on the news late last night. The obituaries reminded me yet again of how incomplete, how seriously incomplete literary history must always be. How few of us know that John and I were members of an unacknowledged school of writing rooted in the Golden Age of Magazine Fiction which followed World War Two, and that, for us, \u201cKnox Burger\u201d and \u201cKen Littauer\u201d and \u201cMax Wilkinson\u201d and so on were names with which to conjure.\nDear Max, who was already contemplating his own death when I met him a third of a century ago, talked even back then about \u201call the good people on the other side.\u201d He meant those who had died, of course. And the population of Heaven, which now includes those two great friends, John and Max, continues to grow by leaps and bounds. I don\u2019t scoff at the idea of Heaven nearly as much as I used to. My first wife Jane, whom you met, I think, and with whom I remained on friendly terms, herself crossed over about eight days before John.\nJohn\u2019s reputation as a writer was sky high at the time of his death. The huge body of absolutely first rate work he gave the world is sure to remain popular well into the next millennium. Think of that! I hope he knew I loved and admired him, and was grateful for the encouragement he gave me from time to time.\nVery sadly yours,\nKurt Vonnegut\nP.S.

Young Knechtmann would not look, wouldn\u2019t share the moment, and after a few minutes the nurse took him away again.\nHeinz beamed as he rode on the elevator and as he crossed the hospital lobby, but no one gave him more than a cursory glance. He passed a row of telephone booths and there, in one of the booths with the door open, he saw a soldier with whom he\u2019d shared the waiting room an hour before.\n\"Yeah, Ma\u2014seven pounds six ounces.

That\u2019s right, seven pounds six ounces....\"\nThere were five other booths, all empty, all open for calls to anyplace on earth. Heinz longed to hurry into one of them breathlessly, and tell the marvelous news. But there was no one to call, no one waiting for the news.\nBut Heinz still beamed, and he strode across the street and into a quiet tavern there. In the dank twilight there were only two men, t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, the bartender and Mr. Sousa.\n\"Yes sir, what\u2019ll it be?\"\n\"I\u2019d like to buy you and Mr. Sousa a drink,\" said Heinz with a heartiness strange to him. \"I\u2019d like the best brandy you\u2019ve got.
