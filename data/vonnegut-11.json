that PFC Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., wrote to his family after being released as a prisoner of war.\nVictor Jose, Kurt\u2019s friend from Shortridge High School in Indianapolis (and later the Chicago News Bureau), wrote in a note to me that \u201cI believe this letter was first read publicly in 1945 at a meeting of The Portfolio Club of artists and literary people [in Indianapolis], to which my parents belonged.\u201d Jose said his parents told him the letter was read to the group by Kurt\u2019s father, who was also a member of the club.\nThis letter recounts the experience\u2014the firebombing of Dresden\u2014that would shape the theme of Kurt\u2019s later work and come to its powerful fruition with his 1969 novel Slaughterhouse-Five, which became an international bestseller and catapulted its author to worldwide fame. There is also a foreshadowing of his future style in the understated dark irony of the grim events he reports and his own survival. \u201cBut not me \u2026 but not me\u201d seems later to echo in the phrase that would famously be repeated in much of his published work: \u201cSo it goes \u2026\u201d\nDear people:\nI\u2019m told that you were probably never informed that I was anything other than \u201cmissing in action.\u201d Chances are that you also failed to receive any of the letters I wrote from Germany. That leaves me a lot of explaining to do\u2014in precis:\nI\u2019ve been a prisoner of war since December 19th, 1944, when our division was cut to ribbons by Hitler\u2019s last desperate thrust through Luxemburg and Belgium. Seven Fanatical Panzer Divisions hit us and cut us off from the rest of Hodges\u2019 First Army. The other American Divisions on our flanks managed to pull out: We were obliged to stay and fight. Bayonets aren\u2019t much good against tanks: Our ammunition, food and medical supplies gave out and our casualties out-numbered those who could still fight\u2014so we gave up. The 106th got a Presidential Citation and some British Decoration from Montgomery for it, I\u2019m told, but I\u2019ll be damned if it was worth it. I was one of the few who weren\u2019t wounded. For that much thank God.\nWell, the supermen marched us, without food, water or sleep to Limberg, a distance of about sixty miles, I think, where we were loaded and locked up, sixty men to each small, unventilated, unheated box car. There were no sanitary accommodations\u2014the floors were covered with fresh cow dung. There wasn\u2019t room for all of us to lie down. Half slept while the other half stood. We spent several days, including Christmas, on that Limberg siding. On Christmas eve the Royal Air Force bombed and strafed our unmarked train. They killed about one-hundred-and-fifty of us. We got a little water Christmas Day and moved slowly across Germany to a large P.O.W. Camp in Muhlburg, South of Berlin. We were released from the box cars on New Year\u2019s Day. The Germans herded us through scalding delousing showers. Many men died from shock in the showers after ten days of starvation, thirst and exposure. But I didn\u2019t.\nUnder the Geneva Convention, Officers and Noncommissioned Officers are not obliged to work when taken prisoner. I am, as you know, a Private. One-hundred-and-fifty such minor beings were shipped to a Dresden work camp on January 10th. I was their leader by virtue of the little German I spoke. It was our misfortune to have sadistic and fanatical guards. We were refused medical attention and clothing: We were given long hours at extremely hard labor. Our food ration was two-hundred-and-fifty grams of black bread and one pint of unseasoned potato soup each day. After desperately trying to improve our situation for two months and having been met with bland smiles I told the guards just what I was going to do to them when the Russians came. They beat me up a little. I was fired as group leader. Beatings were very small time:\u2014one boy starved to death and the SS Troops shot two for stealing food.\nOn about February 14th the Americans came over, followed by the R.A.F.

portfolio of pictures he had created in Midland City. I myself have examined some of the artwork of his youth, which Mother used to moon over after he died. He was good at cross-hatching and shading a drapery, and August Gunther must have been capable in those areas, too. But with few exceptions, everything Father depicted wound up looking as though it were made of cement\u2014a cement woman in a cement dress, walking a cement dog, a herd of cement cattle, a cement bowl of cement fruit, set before a window with cement curtains, and so on.\nHe was no good at catching likenesses, either. He showed the Academy several portraits of his mother, and I have no idea what she looked like. Her peephole closed long before mine opened. But I do know that no two of Father\u2019s portraits of her resemble each other in the least.\nFather was told to come back to the Academy in two weeks, at which time they would tell him whether they would\u2019 take him in or not.\nHe was in rags at the time, with a piece of rope for a belt, and with patched trousers and so on\u2014although he was receiving an enormous allowance from home. Vienna was then the capital of a great empire, and there were so many elaborate uniforms and exotic costumes, and so much wine and music that it seemed to Father to be a fancy dress ball. So he decided to come to the party as a starving artist. What fun!\nAnd he must have been very good-looking then, for he was, in my opinion, the best-looking man in Midland City when I got to know him a quarter of a century later. He was slender and erect to the end. He was six feet tall. His eyes were blue. He had curly golden hair, and he had lost almost none of it when his peephole closed, when he was allowed to stop being Otto Waltz, when he became just another wisp of undifferentiated nothingness again.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo he came back in two weeks, and a professor handed him back his portfolio, saying that his work was ludicrous. And there was another young man in rags there, and he, too, had his portfolio returned with scorn.\nHis name was Adolf Hitler. He was a native Austrian. He had come from Linz.\nAnd Father was so mad at the professor that he got his revenge right then and there. He asked to see some of Hitler\u2019s work, with the professor looking on. He picked a picture at random, and he said it was a brilliant piece of work, and he bought it from Hitler for more cash on the spot than the professor, probably, could earn in a month or more.\nOnly an hour before, Hitler had sold his overcoat so that he could get a little something to eat, even though winter was coming on. So there is a chance that, if it weren\u2019t for my father, Hitler might have died of pneumonia or malnutrition in 1910.", 0.1439965986394558], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "god-bless-you-dr-kevorkian": {"tfidf": [["brown", 0.07434635818729092], ["jefferson", 0.07082818560916265], ["legal", 0.05575976864046819], ["law", 0.05575976864046819], ["perfect", 0.047218790406108435], ["encapsulated", 0.047218790406108435], ["evil", 0.047218790406108435], ["country", 0.04069135167177372], ["john", 0.04069135167177372], ["thomas", 0.03717317909364546], ["burke", 0.03717317909364546], ["holocaust", 0.03717317909364546], ["beautiful", 0.03717317909364546], ["white", 0.03129687317903438], ["ta", 0.023893603269382342], ["operations", 0.023609395203054218], ["civilized", 0.023609395203054218], ["battle", 0.023609395203054218], ["folks", 0.023609395203054218], ["hideous", 0.023609395203054218], ["founding", 0.023609395203054218], ["sacred", 0.023609395203054218], ["horror", 0.023609395203054218], ["nation", 0.023609395203054218], ["1955", 0.023609395203054218], ["realize", 0.023609395203054218], ["subservience", 0.023609395203054218], ["virginian", 0.023609395203054218], ["slavery", 0.023609395203054218], ["hymn", 0.023609395203054218], ["choral", 0.023609395203054218], ["nuclear", 0.023609395203054218], ["gentleman", 0.023609395203054218], ["deemed", 0.023609395203054218], ["throng", 0.023609395203054218], ["equal", 0.023609395203054218], ["torrington", 0.023609395203054218], ["gleeful", 0.023609395203054218], ["color", 0.023609395203054218], ["stanza", 0.023609395203054218], ["owning", 0.023609395203054218], ["yankee", 0.023609395203054218], ["incomparable", 0.023609395203054218], ["chatted", 0.023609395203054218], ["sophisticated", 0.023609395203054218], ["connecticut", 0.023609395203054218], ["atrocities", 0.023609395203054218], ["straight", 0.023609395203054218], ["1961", 0.023609395203054218], ["republic", 0.023609395203054218], ["harmony", 0.023609395203054218], ["molderin", 0.023609395203054218], ["arly", 0.023609395203054218], ["chief", 0.023609395203054218], ["jeering", 0.023609395203054218], ["committed", 0.01858658954682273], ["gorsuch", 0.01858658954682273], ["truth", 0.01858658954682273], ["inside", 0.01858658954682273], ["hanged", 0.01858658954682273], ["navy", 0.01858658954682273], ["rendition", 0.01858658954682273], ["admiral", 0.01858658954682273], ["body", 0.01858658954682273], ["led", 0.01858658954682273], ["marchin", 0.01858658954682273], ["naval", 0.01858658954682273], ["washington", 0.01858658954682273], ["lies", 0.01858658954682273], ["george", 0.01858658954682273], ["congratulated", 0.01858658954682273], ["roberta", 0.01858658954682273], ["wise", 0.01858658954682273], ["society", 0.01858658954682273], ["persons", 0.01858658954682273], ["grave", 0.01858658954682273], ["german", 0.01564843658951719], ["beloved", 0.01564843658951719], ["born", 0.01564843658951719], ["full", 0.01564843658951719], ["scientific", 0.01564843658951719], ["created", 0.01564843658951719], ["write", 0.01564843658951719], ["natural", 0.01564843658951719], ["slaves", 0.01564843658951719], ["father", 0.013563783890591243], ["married", 0.013563783890591243], ["seventy", 0.013563783890591243], ["example", 0.013563783890591243], ["yesterday", 0.013563783890591243], ["quote", 0.011946801634691171], ["gates", 0.010625630933285703], ["years", 0.010625630933285703], ["men", 0.010625630933285703], ["pearly", 0.010625630933285703], ["twenty", 0.010625630933285703], ["person", 0.010625630933285703], ["lethal", 0.009508597021493976], ["texas", 0.009508597021493976], ["facility", 0.009508597021493976], ["huntsville", 0.009508597021493976], ["injection", 0.009508597021493976], ["man", 0.009508597021493976], ["american", 0.008540978234359755], ["earth", 0.007687477975980164], ["signing", 0.006923995978459683], ["god", 0.006923995978459683], ["died", 0.006923995978459683], ["controlled", 0.006923995978459683], ["age", 0.006923995978459683], ["experience", 0.005602825277054215], ["time", 0.003985843021154145], ["kurt", 0.003985843021154145], ["death", 0.003518172578128267], ["people", 0.003518172578128267], ["vonnegut", 0.003078863724385985]], "sentiment": ["I congratulated him on what he\u2019d said on his way to be hanged before a gleeful, jeering throng of white folks.

Then I don\u2019t have to justify my actions. You saw the outrage that gave me no alternative.\u201d He dismissed the matter with a shrug. \u201cWell, first let me say that we\u2019re glad you\u2019re here. My sister brought you up as her own, and that\u2019s what I intend to do. I know a good bit about you already from your mother\u2019s letters. You\u2019re thinner than I expected\u2014a whole lot thinner\u2014but otherwise she kept me pretty well posted. She was a lot better letter writer than I am. I know you\u2019re quite a piano player, for one thing, and that you were looking forward to going to Chicago to study at the Conservatory this winter, before all this happened. That right?\u201d\n\u201cYessir, it is. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGood for you. If there\u2019s anything I admire in a man, it\u2019s ambition. Frankly, wanting to be a piano player seems like a funny one to me, but, like I\u2019ve told the girls a million times, \u2018I don\u2019t care what you want to be, just as long as it\u2019s honest, and you want to be the best there is.\u2019 I think maybe we can send you to Chicago, all right.\u201d\nHaley broke into his first heartfelt smile of the interview.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019re pretty smart all the way around, too,\u201d the General continued. He settled into a chair and lit a cigarette. \u201cHere you are sixteen, and you\u2019ve already finished up high school. Wish you\u2019d give some of your brains to Kitty. Looks like she\u2019ll be in high school until the diamond jubilee of the atom bomb.\u201d He motioned for Haley to sit down. \u201cI hope you haven\u2019t got a swelled head about your school record.\u201d\n\u201cI just liked school was all,\u201d said Haley, blushing, \u201cand I went to summer school. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m any smarter than\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say Kitty,\u201d warned the General. \u201cI was just going to tell you a story about a man I grew up with, just in case you were cocky about being smart in school. I see you aren\u2019t, but I\u2019ll tell it to you anyway. I learned a lot from what happened to him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like very much to hear about it,\u201d said Haley.\n\u201cWell, Haley, this boyhood chum of mine was a lot like you, from what I\u2019ve heard about you. He was always reading books, books, books\u2014everything he could get his hands on. We used to ask him to come fishing or to play baseball, and things like that, and he always had the same answer: \u2018No thanks, I just got a new book that looks very interesting.\u2019 Sometimes he\u2019d forget to stop reading for meals. By the time he was fifteen, he knew more about the royal family of Siam and the slum problem in Vladivostok than I knew about the back of my hand. All his teachers swore he was a genius, and said he\u2019d be at least President of the United States when he was thirty-five.\u201d He paused to give Haley a meaningful look.\nHaley attempted to appear as solemn and absorbed as possible. \u201cWhat finally became of him?\u201d he asked soberly.", 0.23214539214539218], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "basic-training": {"tfidf": [["black", 0.04587891679200261], ["coffee", 0.037770573557621805], ["banghart", 0.03300700859809263], ["nephew", 0.031658603544160904], ["gulped", 0.031658603544160904], ["wednesdays", 0.031658603544160904], ["enjoy", 0.031658603544160904], ["ignored", 0.031658603544160904], ["haired", 0.031658603544160904], ["shaved", 0.031658603544160904], ["bow", 0.031658603544160904], ["fridays", 0.031658603544160904], ["grooming", 0.031658603544160904], ["manners", 0.031658603544160904], ["speak", 0.031658603544160904], ["thirties", 0.031658603544160904], ["mondays", 0.031658603544160904], ["wax", 0.031658603544160904], ["devoting", 0.031658603544160904], ["grabbing", 0.031658603544160904], ["faultless", 0.031658603544160904], ["patronizing", 0.031658603544160904], ["wonderfully", 0.031658603544160904], ["apples", 0.031658603544160904], ["pomaded", 0.031658603544160904], ["muscular", 0.031658603544160904], ["helmet", 0.031658603544160904], ["patent", 0.031658603544160904], ["luster", 0.031658603544160904], ["courtly", 0.031658603544160904], ["squeezing", 0.031658603544160904], ["resembled", 0.031658603544160904], ["customary", 0.0261574354444788], ["pleased", 0.0261574354444788], ["leather", 0.0261574354444788], ["served", 0.0261574354444788], ["scrubbed", 0.0261574354444788], ["sign", 0.0261574354444788], ["saturday", 0.0261574354444788], ["strong", 0.0261574354444788], ["muttered", 0.0261574354444788], ["entered", 0.0261574354444788], ["mornings", 0.0261574354444788], ["word", 0.0261574354444788], ["threadbare", 0.0261574354444788], ["solemnly", 0.0261574354444788], ["person", 0.0261574354444788], ["pleasure", 0.0261574354444788], ["flapjacks", 0.0261574354444788], ["grateful", 0.022939458396001304], ["sing", 0.022939458396001304], ["range", 0.022939458396001304], ["denim", 0.022939458396001304], ["simply", 0.022939458396001304], ["startled", 0.022939458396001304], ["squad", 0.022939458396001304], ["chance", 0.022939458396001304], ["heavily", 0.020656267344796694], ["laughing", 0.020656267344796694], ["gathered", 0.020656267344796694], ["met", 0.020656267344796694], ["working", 0.020656267344796694], ["half", 0.018885286778810902], ["chair", 0.018885286778810902], ["clothes", 0.018885286778810902], ["opened", 0.018885286778810902], ["tone", 0.018885286778810902], ["glad", 0.018885286778810902], ["crossed", 0.018885286778810902], ["meet", 0.018885286778810902], ["night", 0.018345566706477117], ["table", 0.0174382902963192], ["singing", 0.0174382902963192], ["case", 0.0174382902963192], ["breakfast", 0.0174382902963192], ["brandon", 0.0174382902963192], ["hair", 0.01621487220245207], ["full", 0.01621487220245207], ["attention", 0.01621487220245207], ["shook", 0.01621487220245207], ["talk", 0.01621487220245207], ["man", 0.015765901158893387], ["arose", 0.01515509924511459], ["hands", 0.014220313247841706], ["hear", 0.014220313247841706], ["dropped", 0.013384118679128799], ["supper", 0.013384118679128799], ["hard", 0.011937122196637095], ["kind", 0.011937122196637095], ["will", 0.01130186261192649], ["barn", 0.010166141630651302], ["voice", 0.009653931145432485], ["sat", 0.009653931145432485], ["thought", 0.009653931145432485], ["hand", 0.0087191451481596], ["face", 0.0087191451481596], ["door", 0.007882950579446693], ["room", 0.007882950579446693], ["annie", 0.00781708706504435], ["heard", 0.007126520580999671], ["general", 0.005787985929966812], ["good", 0.005501168099682105], ["time", 0.005501168099682105], ["haley", 0.0026957377130605075], ["hope", 0.0018078089751643806]], "sentiment": ["\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d muttered Hope. Haley was grateful that only he seemed to have heard her. The General gave no sign, devoting his full attention to the flapjacks Annie had placed before him. As had been the case at supper the night before, the General was the first to be served. Haley gathered that it was customary not to talk during breakfast.\nAs he gulped the last of his strong, black coffee, the back door opened, and a muscular, black-haired man, apparently in his thirties, entered. His clothes were threadbare denim, but his manners were wonderfully courtly, Haley thought, and his grooming faultless. His face was shaved and scrubbed to the luster of wax apples, and his heavily pomaded hair resembled a patent-leather helmet as he crossed the room to a chair next to the range. He made a brief bow to each person at the table, and sat down.\n\u201cAnnie\u2019ll get you some coffee, Mr. Banghart,\u201d said the General. \u201cBy the way, you haven\u2019t met my nephew, have you?

Did you enjoy it?\u201d\n\u201cYou have an awfully good voice, I think,\u201d said Haley.\nMr. Banghart, who had dropped Haley\u2019s hand, startled him by grabbing it again, and squeezing it hard. \u201cThat\u2019s the first kind word anybody\u2019s ever had for me,\u201d he said solemnly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply not so,\u201d said the General, in a half-laughing, patronizing tone.\nMr. Banghart ignored him. \u201cI\u2019d be glad to sing for you any time,\u201d he said to Haley. \u201cWhat would you like to hear?\u201d", 0.18220164609053496], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["squashed", 0.14756705402396836], ["writers", 0.11525492788667102], ["iron", 0.11520934490725837], ["stories", 0.10023064483473011], ["stencil", 0.0983780360159789], ["reporters", 0.0983780360159789], ["veteran", 0.07683661859111401], ["elevator", 0.07683661859111401], ["car", 0.06791851869743278], ["office", 0.057604672453629185], ["telephone", 0.05529520116624912], ["news", 0.05136048164738341], ["ornamental", 0.04918901800798945], ["lace", 0.04918901800798945], ["lovebirds", 0.04918901800798945], ["fashioned", 0.04918901800798945], ["dictate", 0.04918901800798945], ["perched", 0.04918901800798945], ["twig", 0.04918901800798945], ["ivy", 0.04918901800798945], ["phoned", 0.04918901800798945], ["mimeograph", 0.04918901800798945], ["mimeographed", 0.04918901800798945], ["beastly", 0.04918901800798945], ["ornaments", 0.04918901800798945], ["cartridges", 0.04918901800798945], ["sheets", 0.04918901800798945], ["finn", 0.04918901800798945], ["headphones", 0.04918901800798945], ["floor", 0.04808491135987034], ["pneumatic", 0.0423934574142645], ["sad", 0.0423934574142645], ["snaked", 0.0423934574142645], ["toughest", 0.0423934574142645], ["jobs", 0.0423934574142645], ["hoisted", 0.0423934574142645], ["statement", 0.0423934574142645], ["woman", 0.04170407997879921], ["stuffed", 0.03841830929555701], ["department", 0.03841830929555701], ["tubes", 0.03841830929555701], ["basement", 0.03559789682053954], ["velvet", 0.03559789682053954], ["brass", 0.03559789682053954], ["dropped", 0.03341021494491004], ["captain", 0.03341021494491004], ["job", 0.03341021494491004], ["cut", 0.03341021494491004], ["expect", 0.03341021494491004], ["door", 0.0330406926792102], ["decided", 0.03162274870183205], ["ring", 0.03162274870183205], ["writer", 0.03162274870183205], ["started", 0.03162274870183205], ["police", 0.03162274870183205], ["wedding", 0.030111467527055007], ["building", 0.030111467527055007], ["ate", 0.030111467527055007], ["running", 0.030111467527055007], ["guy", 0.030111467527055007], ["caught", 0.030111467527055007], ["girls", 0.028802336226814593], ["women", 0.02764760058312456], ["holes", 0.02764760058312456], ["covered", 0.026614654351185086], ["asked", 0.025090396441795216], ["call", 0.024827188108107096], ["wearing", 0.024827188108107096], ["baby", 0.02404245567993517], ["happened", 0.02404245567993517], ["young", 0.02263950623247759], ["story", 0.02200677563308964], ["top", 0.021412416595673608], ["wife", 0.019819093757460132], ["air", 0.019819093757460132], ["closed", 0.018448878636135046], ["men", 0.015522476787546842], ["looked", 0.013526408598907238], ["going", 0.009551260480199747], ["war", 0.00647618637377777]], "sentiment": ["Reporters would telephone in stories to writers wearing headphones, and the writers would stencil the stories on mimeograph sheets. The stories were mimeographed and stuffed into the brass and velvet cartridges which the pneumatic tubes ate. The very toughest reporters and writers were women who had taken over the jobs of men who\u2019d gone to war.\nAnd the first story I covered I had to dictate over the telephone to one of those beastly girls. It was about a young veteran who had taken a job running an old-fashioned elevator in an office building. The elevator door on the first floor was ornamental iron lace. Iron ivy snaked in and out of the holes. There was an iron twig with two iron lovebirds perched upon it.\nThis veteran decided to take his car into the basement, and he closed the door and started down, but his wedding ring was caught in all the ornaments. So he was hoisted into the air and the floor of the car went down, dropped out from under him, and the top of the car squashed him. So it goes.\nSo I phoned this in, and the woman who was going to cut the stencil asked me, \u201cWhat did his wife say?\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know yet,\u201d I said. \u201cIt just happened.\u201d\n\u201cCall her up and get a statement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cTell her you\u2019re Captain Finn of the Police Department.

sufficiently dignified and important to merit his carrying it humbly between two points.\nThe motto under the coat of arms that Constant had designed for himself said simply, The Messenger Awaits.\nWhat Constant had in mind, presumably, was a first-class message from God to someone equally distinguished.\nConstant looked at his solar watch again. He had two minutes in which to climb down and reach the house\u2014two minutes before Kazak would materialize and look for strangers to bite. Constant laughed to himself, thinking how delighted Mrs. Rumfoord would be were the vulgar, parvenu Mr. Constant of Hollywood to spend his entire visit treed on the fountain by a thoroughbred dog. Mrs. Rumfoord might even have the fountain turned on.\nIt was possible that she was watching Constant. The mansion was a minute\u2019s walk from the fountain\u2014set off from the jungle by a mowed swath three times the width of the path.\nThe Rumfoord mansion was marble, an extended reproduction of the banqueting hall of Whitehall Palace in London. The mansion, like most of the really grand ones in Newport, was a collateral relative of post offices and Federal court buildings throughout the land.\nThe Rumfoord mansion was an hilariously impressive expression of the concept: People of substance. It was surely one of the greatest essays on density since the Great Pyramid of Khufu. In a way it was a better essay on permanence than the Great Pyramid, since the Great Pyramid tapered to nothingness as it approached heaven. Nothing about the Rumfoord mansion diminished as it approached heaven. Turned upside down, it would have looked exactly the same.\nThe density and permanence of the mansion were, of course, at ironic variance with the fact that the quondam master of the house, except for one hour in every fifty-nine days, was no more substantial than a moon-beam.\nConstant climbed down from the fountain, stepping onto the rims of bowls of ever-increasing sizes. When he got to the bottom, he was filled with a strong wish to see the fountain go. He thought of the crowd outside, thought of how they, too, would enjoy seeing the fountain go. They would be enthralled\u2014watching the teenyweeny bowl at the tippy-tippy top brimming over into the next little bowl ... and the next little bowl\u2019s brimming over into the next little bowl ... and the next little bowl\u2019s brimming over into the next bowl ... and on and on and on, a rhapsody of brimming, each bowl singing its own merry water song. And yawning under all those bowls was the upturned mouth of the biggest bowl of them all ... a regular Beelzebub of a bowl, bone dry and insatiable ... waiting, waiting, waiting for that first sweet drop.\nConstant was rapt, imagining that the fountain was running. The fountain was very much like an hallucination\u2014and hallucinations, usually drug-induced, were almost all that could surprise and entertain Constant any more.", 0.1625181598062954], "title":

Human beings are supposed to live in stable, like-minded, extended families of fifty people or more.\nYour class spokesperson mourned the collapse of the institution of marriage in this country. Marriage is collapsing because our families are too small. A man cannot be a whole society to a woman, and a woman cannot be a whole society to a man. We try, but it is scarcely surprising that so many of us go to pieces.\nSo I recommend that everybody here join all sorts of organizations, no matter how ridiculous, simply to get more people in his or her life. It does not matter much if all the other members are morons. Quantities of relatives of any sort are what we need.\nAs for boredom: Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, a German philosopher who died seventy-eight years ago, had this to say: \u201cAgainst boredom even the gods contend in vain.\u201d We are supposed to be bored. It is a part of life. Learn to put up with it, or you will not be what I have declared the members of this graduating class to be: mature women and men.\nI come to a close now by noting that the press, whose business is to know and understand everything, often find young people to be apathetic (especially when pundits and commentators can\u2019t think of anything else to write about or talk about). The new generation of graduates has failed to eat a certain vitamin or mineral perhaps, iron perhaps. They have tired blood. They need Geritol. Well, as a member of a zippier generation, with sparkle in its eyes and a snap in its stride, let me tell you what kept us as high as kites a lot of the time: Hatred. All my life I\u2019ve had people to hate\u2014from Hitler to Nixon, not that those two are at all comparable in their villainy. It is a tragedy, perhaps, that human beings can get so much energy and enthusiasm from hate. If you want to feel ten feet tall and as though you could run a hundred miles without stopping, hate beats pure cocaine any day. Hitler resurrected a beaten, bankrupt, half-starved nation with hatred and nothing more. Imagine that.\nSo it seems quite likely to me that young people of today in the United States of America is not in fact apathetic, but only looks that way to people who are used to getting their ecstasies from hatred, among other things, of course. The members of your graduating class are not sleepy, are not listless, are not apathetic. They are simply performing the experiment of doing without hate. Hate is the missing vitamin or mineral or whatever in their diet, they have sensed correctly that hate, in the long run, is about as nourishing as cyanide. This is a very exciting thing they are doing, and I wish them well.\nVONNEGUT GIVES ADVICE TO GRADUATING WOMEN (WHICH ALL MEN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT!)\nIn which the author answers the question that Freud asked, but never could figure out: \u201cWhat do women want?\u201d For good measure, he also reveals what men really want.2\nWe love you, are proud of you, expect good things from you, and wish you well.\nThis is a long-delayed puberty ceremony. You are at last officially full-grown women\u2014what you were biologically by the age of 15 or so. I am as sorry as I can be that it took so much time and money before you could at last be licensed as grown-ups.", 0.022412795537795523], "title": "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"}, "galapagos":

MYSTERY a million years ago as to how a thirty-five-year-old American male named James Wait, who could not swim a stroke, intended to get from the South American continent to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. He certainly wasn\u2019t going to squat on a natural raft of vegetable matter and hope for the best. He had just bought a ticket at his hotel in downtown Guayaquil for a two-week cruise on what was to be the maiden voyage of a new passenger ship called the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, Spanish for \u201cDarwin Bay.\u201d This first Gal\u00e1pagos trip for the ship, which flew the Ecuadorian flag, had been publicized and advertised all over the world during the past year as \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d\nWait was traveling alone. He was prematurely bald and he was pudgy, and his color was bad, like the crust on a pie in a cheap cafeteria, and he was bespectacled, so that he might plausibly claim to be in his fifties, in case he saw some advantage in making such a claim. He wished to seem harmless and shy.\nHe was the only customer now in the cocktail lounge of the Hotel El Dorado, on the broad Calle Diez de Agosto, where he had taken a room. And the bartender, a twenty-year-old descendant of proud Inca noblemen, named Jes\u00fas Ortiz, got the feeling that this drab and friendless man, who claimed to be a Canadian, had had his spirit broken by some terrible injustice or tragedy. Wait wanted everybody who saw him to feel that way.\nJes\u00fas Ortiz, who is one of the nicest people in this story of mine, pitied rather than scorned this lonesome tourist. He found it sad, as Wait had hoped he would, that Wait had just spent a lot of money in the hotel boutique\u2014on a straw hat and rope sandals and yellow shorts and a blue-and-white-and-purple cotton shirt, which he was wearing now. Wait had had considerable dignity, Ortiz thought, when he had arrived from the airport in a business suit. But now, at great expense, he had turned himself into a clown, a caricature of a North American tourist in the tropics.\nThe price tag was still stapled to the hem of Wait\u2019s crackling new shirt, and Ortiz, very politely and in good English, told him so.\n\u201cOh?\u201d said Wait. He knew the tag was there, and he wanted it to remain there. But he went through a charade of self-mocking embarrassment, and seemed about to pluck off the tag. But then, as though overwhelmed by some sorrow he was trying to flee from, he appeared to forget all about it.\nWait was a fisherman, and the price tag was his bait, a way of encouraging strangers to speak to him, to say in one way or another what Ortiz had said: \u201cExcuse me, Se\u00f1or, but I can\u2019t help noticing\u2014\u201d\nWait was registered at the hotel under the name on his bogus Canadian passport, which was Willard Flemming. He was a supremely successful swindler.\nOrtiz himself was in no danger from him, but an unescorted woman who looked as though she had a little money, and who was without a husband and past childbearing, surely would have been. Wait had so far courted and married seventeen such persons\u2014and then cleaned out their jewelry boxes and safe-deposit boxes and bank accounts, and disappeared.", 0.08410845910845911], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["sleeps", 0.06143260149695336], ["refrigerator", 0.06143260149695336], ["pencil", 0.06143260149695336], ["playing", 0.06143260149695336], ["bother", 0.04865804000081254], ["wounded", 0.04865804000081254], ["loneliness", 0.045312899623466255], ["won", 0.043789796624968735], ["mine", 0.04079240842275956], ["move", 0.04059818906406899], ["museum", 0.03989775793925577], ["paul", 0.034663375512796385], ["stood", 0.03465835622958073], ["couple", 0.031607608968330834], ["supper", 0.03074588836189221], ["vet", 0.03071630074847668], ["deliberately", 0.03071630074847668], ["gobbles", 0.03071630074847668], ["nutriment", 0.03071630074847668], ["bowls", 0.03071630074847668], ["novelist", 0.03071630074847668], ["encouraged", 0.03071630074847668], ["rattlesnake", 0.03071630074847668], ["attracted", 0.03071630074847668], ["iguanas", 0.03071630074847668], ["primary", 0.03071630074847668], ["shun", 0.03071630074847668], ["doodle", 0.03071630074847668], ["memo", 0.03071630074847668], ["visual", 0.03071630074847668], ["broke", 0.03071630074847668], ["cards", 0.03071630074847668], ["varies", 0.03071630074847668], ["pad", 0.03071630074847668], ["basket", 0.03071630074847668], ["depression", 0.028488260286997358], ["write", 0.028488260286997358], ["painters", 0.027194938948506376], ["job", 0.027194938948506376], ["friend", 0.027194938948506376], ["source", 0.026686375280104903], ["philistines", 0.026686375280104903], ["charlatans", 0.026686375280104903], ["snapped", 0.026686375280104903], ["ridicule", 0.026686375280104903], ["busted", 0.026686375280104903], ["argue", 0.026686375280104903], ["gutshot", 0.026686375280104903], ["fools", 0.026686375280104903], ["disgraced", 0.026686375280104903], ["geezer", 0.026686375280104903], ["fruit", 0.026686375280104903], ["eats", 0.026686375280104903], ["true", 0.026598505292837183], ["house", 0.026513232612708278], ["times", 0.02447848719058189], ["walking", 0.02432902000040627], ["daytime", 0.02432902000040627], ["writes", 0.02432902000040627], ["watching", 0.02432902000040627], ["poison", 0.02432902000040627], ["hiding", 0.02432902000040627], ["1956", 0.02432902000040627], ["money", 0.024003812835695207], ["hanging", 0.022656449811733127], ["finding", 0.022656449811733127], ["lady", 0.022656449811733127], ["sea", 0.022656449811733127], ["deserved", 0.022656449811733127], ["directly", 0.022656449811733127], ["springs", 0.022656449811733127], ["staring", 0.022656449811733127], ["lonely", 0.021359103583162137], ["guard", 0.021359103583162137], ["tennis", 0.021359103583162137], ["downstairs", 0.021359103583162137], ["hermit", 0.021359103583162137], ["wife", 0.020428409350253803], ["safe", 0.020299094532034496], ["game", 0.020299094532034496], ["arts", 0.020299094532034496], ["threw", 0.020299094532034496], ["waste", 0.020299094532034496], ["literature", 0.020299094532034496], ["body", 0.019402869649317877], ["sitting", 0.019402869649317877], ["jesus", 0.01862652434336135], ["baby", 0.01862652434336135], ["reading", 0.017941739252335866], ["caught", 0.017941739252335866], ["telephone", 0.017941739252335866], ["practically", 0.017941739252335866], ["sense", 0.017941739252335866], ["sell", 0.017941739252335866], ["answer", 0.017329178114790365], ["sons", 0.01677504916243964], ["broken", 0.01677504916243964], ["stand", 0.01626916906366272], ["weeks", 0.015803804484165417], ["child", 0.015372944180946105], ["week", 0.015372944180946105], ["moment", 0.014971822835091735], ["writing", 0.014596598874989578], ["side", 0.014596598874989578], ["exactly", 0.014596598874989578], ["property", 0.014244130143498679], ["great", 0.014218147885948478], ["full", 0.013911813783964092], ["boy", 0.013597469474253188], ["point", 0.013299252646418592], ["edith", 0.012745123694067865], ["surely", 0.012745123694067865], ["beach", 0.012745123694067865], ["friends", 0.012486683214004876], ["door", 0.012239243595290945], ["wanted", 0.011773879015793642], ["book", 0.011773879015793642], ["left", 0.011773879015793642], ["room", 0.011554458504265463], ["karabekian", 0.011343018712574328], ["potato", 0.011343018712574328], ["cook", 0.010941897366719959], ["years", 0.010773196535446472], ["paintings", 0.010751258861935129], ["painter", 0.010566673406617802], ["ago", 0.010387768414369234], ["paint", 0.010214204675126902], ["city", 0.010045672484003341], ["barn", 0.009881888315592318], ["died", 0.009881888315592318], ["rabo", 0.009722591954033511], ["day", 0.00956754400588141], ["york", 0.009125765476940004], ["slazinger", 0.008985663432875698], ["time", 0.008603592400790517], ["kitchen", 0.007856849395428273], ["going", 0.006099402465934473], ["war", 0.005692666485661736]], "sentiment": ["IT HAS BEEN very lonely here since Edith died. The friends we had were hers, not mine. Painters shun me, since the ridicule my own paintings attracted and deserved encouraged Philistines to argue that most painters were charlatans or fools. But I can stand loneliness, if I have to.\nI stood it when a boy. I stood it for several years in New York City during the Great Depression. And after my first wife and my two sons left me in 1956, and I gave up on myself as a painter, I actually went looking for loneliness and found it. I was a hermit for eight years. How is that for a full-time job for a wounded vet?\nAnd I do have a friend who is mine, all mine. He is the novelist Paul Slazinger, a wounded World War Two geezer like myself. He sleeps alone in a house next door to my old house in Springs.\nI say he sleeps there, because he comes over here almost every day, and is probably on the property some-where at this very moment, watching a tennis game, or sitting on the beach, staring out to sea, or playing cards with the cook in the kitchen, or hiding from everybody and everything, and reading a book where practically nobody ever goes, on the far side of the potato barn.\nI don\u2019t think he writes much anymore. And, as I say, I don\u2019t paint at all anymore. I won\u2019t even doodle on the memo pad next to the downstairs telephone. A couple of weeks ago, I caught myself doing exactly that, and I deliberately snapped the point off the pencil, broke the pencil in two, and I threw its broken body into a waste-basket, like a baby rattlesnake which had wanted to poison me.\nPaul has no money. He eats supper with me here four or five times a week, and gobbles directly from my refrigerator and fruit bowls during the daytime, so I am surely his primary source of nutriment. I have said to him many times after supper, \u201cPaul\u2014why don\u2019t you sell your house and get a little walking-around money, and move in here? Look at all the room I\u2019ve got. And I\u2019m never going to have a wife or a lady friend again, and neither are you. Jesus! Who would have us? We look like a couple of gutshot iguanas! So move in! I won\u2019t bother you, and you won\u2019t bother me. What could make more sense?\u201d\nHis answer never varies much from this one: \u201cI can only write at home.\u201d Some home, with a busted refrigerator and nobody ever there but him.\nOne time he said about this house: \u201cWho could write in a museum?\u201d\nWell\u2014I am now finding out if that can be done or not. I am writing in this museum.\nYes, it\u2019s true: I, old Rabo Karabekian, having disgraced myself in the visual arts, am now having a go at literature.

"sentiment": ["1\nAs a kid I was the youngest member of my family, and the youngest child in any family is always a jokemaker, because a joke is the only way he can enter into an adult conversation. My sister was five years older than I was, my brother was nine years older than I was, and my parents were both talkers. So at the dinner table when I was very young, I was boring to all those other people. They did not want to hear about the dumb childish news of my days. They wanted to talk about really important stuff that happened in high school or maybe in college or at work. So the only way I could get into a conversation was to say something funny. I think I must have done it accidentally at first, just accidentally made a pun that stopped the conversation, something of that sort. And then I found out that a joke was a way to break into an adult conversation.\nI grew up at a time when comedy in this country was superb\u2014it was the Great Depression. There were large numbers of absolutely top comedians on radio. And without intending to, I really studied them. I would listen to comedy at least an hour a night all through my youth, and I got very interested in what jokes were and how they worked.\nWhen I\u2019m being funny, I try not to offend. I don\u2019t think much of what I\u2019ve done has been in really ghastly taste. I don\u2019t think I have embarrassed many people, or distressed them. The only shocks I use are an occasional obscene word. Some things aren\u2019t funny. I can\u2019t imagine a humorous book or skit about Auschwitz, for instance. And it\u2019s not possible for me to make a joke about the death of John F. Kennedy or Martin Luther King. Otherwise I can\u2019t think of any subject that I would steer away from, that I could do nothing with. Total catastrophes are terribly amusing, as Voltaire demonstrated. You know, the Lisbon earthquake is funny.\nI saw the destruction of Dresden. I saw the city before and then came out of an air-raid shelter and saw it afterward, and certainly one response was laughter. God knows, that\u2019s the soul seeking some relief.\nAny subject is subject to laughter, and I suppose there was laughter of a very ghastly kind by victims in Auschwitz.\nHumor is an almost physiological response to fear. Freud said that humor is a response to frustration\u2014one of several. A dog, he said, when he can\u2019t get out a gate, will scratch and start digging and making meaningless gestures, perhaps growling or whatever, to deal with frustration or surprise or fear.\nAnd a great deal of laughter is induced by fear. I was working on a funny television series years ago. We were trying to put a show together that, as a basic principle, mentioned death in every episode and that this ingredient would make any laughter deeper without the audience\u2019s realizing how we were inducing belly laughs.\nThere is a superficial sort of laughter. Bob Hope, for example, was not really a humorist. He was a comedian with very thin stuff, never mentioning anything troubling. I used to laugh my head off at Laurel and Hardy. There is terrible tragedy there somehow. These men are too sweet to survive in this world and are in terrible danger all the time. They could be so easily killed.\nEven the simplest jokes are based on tiny twinges of fear, such as the question, \u201cWhat is the white stuff in bird poop?\u201d The auditor, as though called upon to recite in school, is momentarily afraid of saying something stupid. When the auditor hears the answer, which is, \u201cThat\u2019s bird poop, too,\u201d he or she dispels the automatic fear with laughter. He or she has not been tested after all.", 0.0471471088435374], "title": "A Man without a Country"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["chat", 0.1275534170579222], ["st", 0.10464733547799959], ["include", 0.08229969266128702], ["andr", 0.08229969266128702], ["innocent", 0.07400492652317696], ["de", 0.07400492652317696], ["argued", 0.0637767085289611], ["mason", 0.0637767085289611], ["grandmother", 0.0637767085289611], ["nobles", 0.0637767085289611], ["maternal", 0.0637767085289611], ["confrontation", 0.0637767085289611], ["dumbness", 0.0637767085289611], ["marsha", 0.05571685759221755], ["ludicrous", 0.05571685759221755], ["risks", 0.05571685759221755], ["raw", 0.05571685759221755], ["entertains", 0.05571685759221755], ["chooses", 0.05571685759221755], ["liberty", 0.05571685759221755], ["consort", 0.05571685759221755], ["behavior", 0.05571685759221755], ["glorious", 0.05571685759221755], ["scorned", 0.05571685759221755], ["stubborn", 0.0510021470328203], ["dedicated", 0.0510021470328203], ["liberal", 0.0510021470328203], ["actress", 0.0510021470328203], ["simplicity", 0.0510021470328203], ["mocked", 0.0510021470328203], ["superb", 0.0510021470328203], ["mine", 0.05090604808107735], ["ghastly", 0.047657006655473996], ["views", 0.047657006655473996], ["believes", 0.047657006655473996], ["belief", 0.047657006655473996], ["maiden", 0.047657006655473996], ["superstition", 0.047657006655473996], ["starring", 0.047657006655473996], ["expect", 0.04506231419833203], ["captured", 0.04506231419833203], ["clumsy", 0.04506231419833203], ["descended", 0.04294229609607675], ["believed", 0.04294229609607675], ["novelist", 0.04114984633064351], ["west", 0.04114984633064351], ["innocence", 0.04114984633064351], ["louis", 0.04114984633064351], ["statement", 0.04114984633064351], ["consider", 0.03959715571873045], ["reader", 0.03959715571873045], ["masterpiece", 0.03959715571873045], ["nature", 0.03822758553667949], ["find", 0.03801510073908364], ["dumb", 0.0348824451593332], ["song", 0.0348824451593332], ["meant", 0.03308999539389996], ["honor", 0.03308999539389996], ["letter", 0.03228775270219122], ["play", 0.0315373047819869], ["middle", 0.0315373047819869], ["speech", 0.030832367319005106], ["trouble", 0.030832367319005106], ["place", 0.027317473460017505], ["kind", 0.026822594222589646], ["matter", 0.025453024040538674], ["mother", 0.022772516382261555], ["books", 0.02147919504377057], ["school", 0.02147919504377057], ["human", 0.01977450348339993], ["york", 0.01951319120605041], ["asked", 0.01900755036954182], ["thing", 0.01852298413232591], ["great", 0.01656225491795623], ["book", 0.01616805082870412], ["american", 0.01597584964322493], ["good", 0.011072063259737199]], "sentiment": ["The reader should expect me to chat about this and that, and then to include a speech or a letter or a song or whatever, and then to chat some more.\nI do not really consider this to be a masterpiece. I find it clumsy. I find it raw. It has some value, I think, as a confrontation between an American novelist and his own stubborn simplicity. I was dumb in school. Whatever the nature of that dumbness, it is with me still.\nI have dedicated this book to the de St. Andr\u00e9s. I am a de St. Andr\u00e9, since that was the maiden name of a maternal great-grandmother of mine. My mother believed that this meant that she was descended from nobles of some kind.\nThis was an innocent belief, and so should not be mocked or scorned. Or so I say. My books so far have argued that most human behavior, no matter how ghastly or ludicrous or glorious or whatever, is innocent.

They ran down her cheeks, then down her white enamelled front to the floor.\nI smiled and winked at George to let him know how slick I thought his act was, and that I really did want to see him.\nHe didn\u2019t smile back.

There wasn\u2019t anything inside but cold air, stainless steel, porcelain, and a glass of orange juice.

I want to ask Him something I never was able to find out down here.\"\n\"What's that?\" she said, strapping him in.\n\"What in hell are people for?\"\nIn Milford, Eliot told the writers that he wished they would learn more about sex and economics and style, but then he supposed that people dealing with really big issues didn't have much time for such things.\nAnd it occurred to him that a really good science-fiction book had never been written about money. \"Just think of the wild ways money is passed around on Earth!\" he said. \"You don't have to go to the Planet Tralfamadore in Anti-Matter Galaxy 508 G to find weird creatures with unbelievable powers.

It's insane that I should be able to do such a thing, with money so important.\" He lost his balance for a moment, regained it, and then nearly fell asleep on his feet.

It was massively dependent on tomatoes. The company did not make a profit until 1916. As soon as it made one, though, Powers Hapgood\u2019s father began to give his employees some of the benefits he thought workers everywhere in the world were naturally entitled to. The other principal stockholders were his two brothers, also Harvard men\u2014and they agreed with him.\nSo he set up a council of seven workers, who were to recommend to the board of directors what the wages and working conditions should be. The board, without any prodding from anybody, had already declared that there would no longer be any seasonal layoffs, even in such a seasonal industry, and that there would be vacations with pay, and that medical care for workers and their dependents would be free, and that there would be sick pay and a retirement plan, and that the ultimate goal of the company was that, through a stock-bonus plan, it become the property of the workers.\n\u201cIt went bust,\u201d said Uncle Alex, with a certain grim, Darwinian satisfaction.\nMy father said nothing. He may not have been listening.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI now have at hand a copy of The Hapgoods, Three Earnest Brothers, by Michael D. Marcaccio (The University Press of Virginia, Charlottesville, 1977). The three brothers in the subtitle were William, the founder of Columbia Conserve, and Norman and Hutchins, also Harvard men, who were both socialistically inclined journalists and editors and book writers in and around New York. According to Mr. Marcaccio, Columbia Conserve was a quite tidy success until 1931, when the Great Depression hit it murderously. Many workers were let go, and those who were kept on had their pay cut by 50 percent. A great deal of money was owed to Continental Can, which insisted that the company behave more conventionally toward its employees\u2014even if they were stockholders, which most of them were. The experiment was over. There wasn\u2019t any money to pay for it anymore. Those who had received stock through profit sharing now owned bits of a company that was nearly dead.\nIt did not go completely bust for a while. In fact it still existed when Uncle Alex and Father arid Powers Hapgood and I had lunch. But it was just another cannery, paying not one penny more than any other cannery paid. What was left of it was finally sold off to a stronger company in 1953.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNow Powers Hapgood came into the restaurant, an ordinary-looking Middle Western Anglo-Saxon in a cheap business suit. He wore a union badge in his lapel. He was cheerful. He knew my father slightly. He knew Uncle Alex quite well. He apologized for being late. He had been in court that morning, testifying about violence on a picket line some months before. He personally had had nothing to do with the violence. His days of derring-do were behind him. Never again would he fight anybody, or be clubbed to his knees, or be locked up in jail.\nHe was a talker, with far more wonderful stories than Father or Uncle Alex had ever told. He was thrown into a lunatic asylum after he led the pickets at the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. He was in fights with organizers for John L. Lewis\u2019s United Mine Workers, which he considered too right wing. In 1936 he was a CIO organizer at a strike against RCA in Camden, New Jersey. He was put in jail. When several thousand strikers surrounded the jail, as a sort of reverse lynch mob, the sheriff thought it best to turn him loose again. And on and on. I have put my recollections of some of the stories he told into the mouth of, as I say, a fictitious character in this book.", 0.1404046350474922], "title": "Jailbird"}, "petrified-ants": {"tfidf":

the puzzle of how the magnificent ant civilization had declined to the dismal, instinctive ant way of life of the present.\n\u201cHere\u2019s a piece of luck, Josef\u2014ten ants so close together I can cover them with my thumb.\u201d Peter picked up rock after rock, and, wherever he found one ant, he found at least a half dozen close by. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to get gregarious.\u201d\n\u201cAny physical changes?\u201d\nPeter frowned through his magnifying glass. \u201cSame species, all right. No, now, wait\u2014there is a difference, the pincers are more developed, considerably more developed. They\u2019re starting to look like modern workers and soldiers.\u201d He handed a rock to Josef.\n\u201cMmmm, no books here,\u201d said Josef. \u201cYou find any?\u201d\nPeter shook his head, and found that he was deeply distressed by the lack of books, searching for them passionately. \u201cThey\u2019ve still got houses, but now they\u2019re jammed with people.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI mean ants.\u201d Suddenly a cry of joy escaped him. \u201cJosef! Here\u2019s one without the big pincers, just like the ones in the lower level!\u201d He turned the specimen this way and that in the sunlight. \u201cBy himself, Josef. In his house, with his family and books and everything! Some of the ants are differentiating into workers and soldiers\u2014some aren\u2019t!\u201d\nJosef had been reexamining some of the gatherings of the ants with pincers. \u201cThe gregarious ones may not have been interested in books,\u201d he announced. \u201cBut everywhere that you find them, you find pictures.\u201d He frowned perplexedly. \u201cThere\u2019s a bizarre twist, Peter; the picture lovers evolving away from the book lovers.\u201d\n\u201cThe crowd lovers away from the privacy lovers,\u201d said Peter thoughtfully. \u201cThose with big pincers away from those without.\u201d To rest his eyes, he let his gaze wander to the toolshed and a weathered poster from which the eyes of Stalin twinkled. Again he let his gaze roam, this time into the distance\u2014to the teeming mouth of the nearest mine shaft, where a portrait of Stalin beamed paternally on all as they shambled in and out; to a cluster of tar-paper barracks below, where a portrait of Stalin stared shrewdly, protected from the weather by glass, at the abominable sanitary facilities.\n\u201cJosef,\u201d Peter began uncertainly, \u201cI\u2019ll bet tomorrow\u2019s tobacco ration that those works of art the pincered ants like so well are political posters.\u201d\n\u201cIf so, our wonderful ants are bound for an even higher civilization,\u201d said Josef enigmatically.

asymmetrical heart scratched into the old brick, and in its center, \u201cK.L.-M.W.\u201d, and the date, \u201c1931.\u201d K.L. and M.W. had taken a liking to one another, then, in the same year that Edison had died. Paul thought again of the fun of showing the old man around Building 58, and suddenly realized that most of the machinery would be old stuff, even to Edison. The braiders, the welders, the punch presses, the lathes, the conveyers\u2014everything in sight, almost, had been around in Edison\u2019s time. The basic parts of the automatic controls, too, and the electric eyes and other elements that did and did better what human senses had once done for industry\u2014all were familiar enough in scientific circles even in the nineteen-twenties. All that was new was the combination of these elements. Paul reminded himself to bring that out in his talk at the Country Club that night.\nThe cat arched her back and clawed at Paul\u2019s suit again. The sweeper was snuffling down the aisle toward them once more. It sounded its warning buzzer, and Paul stepped out of its path. The cat hissed and spat, suddenly raked Paul\u2019s hand with her claws, and jumped. With a bouncing, stiff-legged gait, she fled before the sweeper. Snatching, flashing, crashing, shrieking machines kept her in the middle of the aisle, yards ahead of the sweeper\u2019s whooshing brooms. Paul looked frantically for the switch that would stop the sweeper, but before he found it, the cat made a stand. She faced the on-coming sweeper, her needle-like teeth bared, the tip of her tail snapping back and forth. The flash of a welder went off inches from her eyes, and the sweeper gobbled her up and hurled her squalling and scratching into its galvanized tin belly.\nWinded after a quarter-mile run through the length of the building, Paul caught the sweeper just as it reached a chute. It gagged, and spat the cat down the chute and into a freight car outside. When Paul got outside, the cat had scrambled up the side of the freight car, tumbled to the ground, and was desperately clawing her way up a fence.\n\u201cNo, kitty, no!\u201d cried Paul.\nThe cat hit the alarm wire on the fence, and sirens screamed from the gate house. In the next second the cat hit the charged wires atop the fence. A pop, a green flash, and the cat sailed high over the top strand as though thrown. She dropped to the asphalt\u2014dead and smoking, but outside.\nAn armored car, its turret nervously jerking its brace of machine guns this way and that, grumbled to a stop by the small corpse. The turret hatch clanged open, and a plant guard cautiously raised his head. \u201cEverything all right, sir?\u201d\n\u201cTurn off the sirens. Nothing but a cat on the fence.\u201d Paul knelt, and looked at the cat through the mesh of the fence, frightfully upset. \u201cPick up the cat and take her to my office.\u201d\n\u201cBeg your pardon, sir?\u201d\n\u201cThe cat\u2014I want her taken to my office.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead, sir.\u201d", 0.05059905174190888], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["henry", 0.1157898479803015], ["ambition", 0.0970849591011866], ["ellen", 0.09705721291945606], ["confido", 0.08543743787466042], ["thoughts", 0.07866544039711695], ["happy", 0.07091163726801408], ["interests", 0.060483917470898846], ["spooky", 0.060483917470898846], ["pot", 0.060483917470898846], ["aha", 0.060483917470898846], ["notify", 0.060483917470898846], ["rocked", 0.060483917470898846], ["garters", 0.060483917470898846], ["chatting", 0.060483917470898846], ["terminating", 0.060483917470898846], ["heartily", 0.060483917470898846], ["tormented", 0.060483917470898846], ["rainbow", 0.060483917470898846], ["wives", 0.060483917470898846], ["husbands", 0.060483917470898846], ["lift", 0.060483917470898846], ["enterpriser", 0.060483917470898846], ["insisted", 0.060483917470898846], ["measured", 0.060483917470898846], ["uncanny", 0.060483917470898846], ["sirs", 0.060483917470898846], ["pursue", 0.060483917470898846], ["promoter", 0.060483917470898846], ["craggy", 0.060483917470898846], ["answers", 0.060483917470898846], ["ship", 0.05294970898655161], ["employment", 0.05294970898655161], ["corporation", 0.05294970898655161], ["towel", 0.05294970898655161], ["happier", 0.05294970898655161], ["hears", 0.05294970898655161], ["embraced", 0.05294970898655161], ["deserve", 0.0485424795505933], ["warmly", 0.0485424795505933], ["minded", 0.0485424795505933], ["gem", 0.0485424795505933], ["accousti", 0.0485424795505933], ["blushed", 0.0485424795505933], ["strode", 0.0485424795505933], ["stars", 0.04541550050220438], ["rubbing", 0.04541550050220438], ["rough", 0.04541550050220438], ["gold", 0.04299002711835427], ["pink", 0.04100827106624607], ["lonely", 0.04100827106624607], ["weeks", 0.04100827106624607], ["absolutely", 0.03933272019855848], ["magic", 0.03788129201785714], ["caught", 0.03545581863400704], ["arms", 0.03545581863400704], ["late", 0.03545581863400704], ["order", 0.03441983841874264], ["dear", 0.03441983841874264], ["kitchen", 0.03441983841874264], ["bright", 0.033474062581898834], ["ready", 0.033474062581898834], ["kid", 0.033474062581898834], ["poor", 0.033474062581898834], ["business", 0.033474062581898834], ["sleep", 0.03260403315066474], ["thinking", 0.031048589198048728], ["friend", 0.031048589198048728], ["children", 0.029688120252896494], ["husband", 0.02640245860210374], ["side", 0.023882875840611082], ["face", 0.0235143807137015], ["love", 0.0231579695960603], ["help", 0.02215391176854926], ["night", 0.02183882984601391], ["great", 0.02183882984601391], ["better", 0.021532624661593298], ["turned", 0.020119003702373756], ["woman", 0.01796192828146247], ["time", 0.012584795218026525], ["man", 0.010319564026972108]], "sentiment": ["\u201cPoor kid, it\u2019s about time your ship came in.

Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.\nThe greatest American short story writer of my generation was Flannery O\u2019Connor (1925\u20131964). She broke practically every one of my rules but the first. Great writers tend to do that.\nMs. O\u2019Connor may or may not have broken my seventh rule, \u201cWrite to please just one person.\u201d There is no way for us to find out for sure, unless, of course, there is a Heaven after all, and she\u2019s there, and the rest of us are going there, and we can ask her.\nI\u2019m almost sure she didn\u2019t break rule seven. The late American psychiatrist Dr. Edmund Bergler, who claimed to have treated more professional writers than any other shrink, said in his book The Writer and Psychoanalysis that most writers in his experience wrote to please one person they knew well, even if they didn\u2019t realize they were doing that. It wasn\u2019t a trick of the fiction trade. It was simply a natural human thing to do, whether or not it could make a story better.\nDr. Bergler said it commonly required psychoanalysis before his patients could know for whom they had been writing. But as soon as I finished his book, and then thought for only a couple of minutes, I knew it was my sister Allie I had been writing for. She is the person the stories in this book were written for. Anything I knew Allie wouldn\u2019t like I crossed out. Everything I knew she would get a kick out of I left in.\nAllie is up in Heaven now, with my first wife Jane and Sam Lawrence and Flannery O\u2019Connor and Dr. Bergler, but I still write to please her. Allie was funny in real life. That gives me permission to be funny, too. Allie and I were very close.\nIn my opinion, a story written for one person pleases a reader, dear reader, because it makes him or her a part of the action. It makes the reader feel, even though he or she doesn\u2019t know it, as though he or she is eavesdropping on a fascinating conversation between two people at the next table, say, in a restaurant.\nThat\u2019s my educated guess.\nHere is another: A reader likes a story written for just one person because the reader can sense, again without knowing it, that the story has boundaries like a playing field. The story can\u2019t go simply anywhere. This, I feel, invites readers to come off the sidelines, to get into the game with the author. Where is the story going next? Where should it go? No fair! Hopeless situation! Touchdown!\nRemember my rule number eight? \u201cGive your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible\u201d? That\u2019s so they can play along. Where, outside the Groves of Academe, does anybody like a story where so much information is withheld or arcane that there is no way for readers to play along?", 0.12034883720930234], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "breakfast-of-champions": {"tfidf": [["pirates", 0.24851912128702797], ["sea", 0.11359881073270221], ["projectiles", 0.0817519311405232], ["beacon", 0.0817519311405232], ["continent", 0.06471918247900212], ["human", 0.06442176922168691], ["beings", 0.05673921429087281], ["slavery", 0.05158278154276641], ["machinery", 0.05158278154276641], ["government", 0.049512527393549007], ["fire", 0.046052937450693034], ["slaves", 0.04457526024442444], ["eliminated", 0.0408759655702616], ["velocities", 0.0408759655702616], ["bone", 0.0408759655702616], ["disciplined", 0.0408759655702616], ["richest", 0.0408759655702616], ["imaginary", 0.0408759655702616], ["introduced", 0.0408759655702616], ["copper", 0.0408759655702616], ["threatening", 0.0408759655702616], ["bellows", 0.0408759655702616], ["astonish", 0.0408759655702616], ["gunpowder", 0.0408759655702616], ["stubborn", 0.0408759655702616], ["meaner", 0.0408759655702616], ["violently", 0.0408759655702616], ["cone", 0.0408759655702616], ["boats", 0.0408759655702616], ["weapon", 0.0408759655702616], ["gas", 0.040836313627108344], ["children", 0.036939965901822976], ["continued", 0.035502731612432566], ["minerals", 0.035502731612432566], ["powder", 0.035502731612432566], ["capacity", 0.035502731612432566], ["wreck", 0.035502731612432566], ["nitrate", 0.035502731612432566], ["greedy", 0.035502731612432566], ["freedom", 0.035502731612432566], ["powerful", 0.035502731612432566], ["listless", 0.035502731612432566], ["charcoal", 0.035502731612432566], ["potassium", 0.035502731612432566], ["sulphur", 0.035502731612432566], ["heartless", 0.035502731612432566], ["chief", 0.035502731612432566], ["plumbing", 0.035502731612432566], ["tubes", 0.035502731612432566], ["eventually", 0.03235959123950106], ["mixture", 0.03235959123950106], ["countries", 0.03235959123950106], ["rockets", 0.03235959123950106], ["statues", 0.03235959123950106], ["nonsense", 0.03235959123950106], ["shoot", 0.03235959123950106], ["cream", 0.03235959123950106], ["country", 0.03184687959217901], ["touched", 0.030129497654603536], ["descendants", 0.030129497654603536], ["seemingly", 0.030129497654603536], ["drop", 0.030129497654603536], ["creation", 0.030129497654603536], ["ice", 0.030129497654603536], ["colored", 0.030129497654603536], ["wiring", 0.030129497654603536], ["terrific", 0.030129497654603536], ["embarrassing", 0.028399702683175553], ["airplanes", 0.028399702683175553], ["arrived", 0.028399702683175553], ["metal", 0.028399702683175553], ["blew", 0.02698635728167203], ["evil", 0.02698635728167203], ["ordinary", 0.025791390771383205], ["cut", 0.024756263696774503], ["color", 0.024756263696774503], ["met", 0.02384321690874052], ["meat", 0.023026468725346517], ["taught", 0.023026468725346517], ["late", 0.02228763012221222], ["piece", 0.021613123323842996], ["easily", 0.02099263721784659], ["created", 0.02099263721784659], ["best", 0.02099263721784659], ["food", 0.020418156813554172], ["pictures", 0.020418156813554172], ["machines", 0.019883328352415013], ["owned", 0.018913071430290935], ["sort", 0.016569808857632536], ["big", 0.015044922855725139], ["supposed", 0.014772897120754053], ["turned", 0.014772897120754053], ["things", 0.013096748993082455], ["planet", 0.012088585208212705], ["wanted", 0.011366954021654472], ["black", 0.00981136723512617], ["white", 0.00981136723512617], ["looked", 0.007616590057483377], ["kilgore", 0.007407065465328963], ["hoover", 0.006528548524964597], ["people", 0.005823340941974469], ["trout", 0.004161248916040708], ["dwayne", 0.0035722108774521653]], "sentiment": ["Here was another piece of evil nonsense which children were taught: that the sea pirates eventually created a government which became a beacon of freedom to human beings everywhere else. There were pictures and statues of this supposed imaginary beacon for children to see. It was sort of an ice-cream cone on fire. It looked like this:\nActually, the sea pirates who had the most to do with the creation of the new government owned human slaves. They used human beings for machinery, and, even after slavery was eliminated, because it was so embarrassing, they and their descendants continued to think of ordinary human beings as machines.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe sea pirates were white. The people who were already on the continent when the pirates arrived were copper-colored. When slavery was introduced onto the continent, the slaves were black.\nColor was everything.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHere is how the pirates were able to take whatever they wanted from anybody else: they had the best boats in the world, and they were meaner than anybody else, and they had gunpowder, which was a mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulphur. They touched this seemingly listless powder with fire, and it turned violently into gas. This gas blew projectiles out of metal tubes at terrific velocities. The projectiles cut through meat and bone very easily; so the pirates could wreck the wiring or the bellows or the plumbing of a stubborn human being, even when he was far, far away.\nThe chief weapon of the sea pirates, however, was their capacity to astonish. Nobody else could believe, until it was much too late, how heartless and greedy they were.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWhen Dwayne Hoover and Kilgore Trout met each other, their country was by far the richest and most powerful country on the planet.
