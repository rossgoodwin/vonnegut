I suspect that all people are motivated by something pretty sordid, and I guess the clinical data bears me out on that.

Years ago, I remember, everybody was telling me to read Blake, Blake, Blake. So I did. Another year it was C\u00e9line, C\u00e9line.\nIn my present condition, though, I find important art (even by persons as wicked as C\u00e9line) almost unbearable. Maybe that is because I myself can\u2019t produce important art, and can\u2019t stand proofs that such art is possible. Things could be worse. I could be in what used to be Leningrad, with nothing to eat and without a clue as to what the fuck to write now.\nWhether I am here or not, the back door of the ell where I write is always unlocked for you and Lee, and the heat is on and there is firewood.
