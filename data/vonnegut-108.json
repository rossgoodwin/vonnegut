["I enclose letters from Mark and Steve. They guessed correctly that I was in far worse shape than you. Mark just might bust his ass this year. That\u2019s a brutal schedule. Then again, he\u2019s got a terrific case of the smarts, and he\u2019s beautifully prepared. With such a challenging schedule, he may be one prep school kid who doesn\u2019t lose his forward motion because college is such a pipe. Steve has a beautiful understanding of himself. A very good boy.\nThings around here are starting to get amusing. As I\u2019ve already said, at a minimum the town is a Utopia. I can walk to everything, and everything\u2019s cheerful and clean. Three blocks from here is an enormous new indoor swimming pool. No one is ever there during school hours, and a dip costs me a dime. And there\u2019s that neat church, and my laundry, and my dry cleaner, and all that crap. I am used to my vile pad now. I work pretty well here now, which is the main thing\u2014and any minute now my telephone will be installed.\nNelson Algren arrived with his very pretty and young wife at the very last minute. He is most friendly to me, and knows my work well. Gertrude told me that Paul Engle was her least favorite person in this world, and Marguerite Young warned me that Bourjaily would cut my throat if I went over big with the students, so I am watchful. Bourjaily and Engle both treat me rather oddly. [\u2026] They never heard of me before, and I still act as though I were somebody. Algren is their prize. Algren is here, by the way, because he\u2019s broke. He worked a deal where he wouldn\u2019t come unless they gave his wife a job, too. She\u2019s an actress, and they found her something to do in the Speech Department.\nQueer as it seems, I still haven\u2019t met my students. Registration and speeches by the president and faculty meetings and all that have used up this first week. I will finally hold my first class at 3:30 this afternoon. There is a curious thing about this obviously first-rate English Department: only ten per cent of its 600 undergraduates are men; and only 25 per cent of its graduate students are women. The graduate men all come from the East or West Coasts. Nelson and I have no futures in the field, since we have no degrees. Bourjaily is loaded with them, and is a university career man. We all have offices, by the way\u2014but no telephones.\nAlong with your music appreciation course, I think you should also take some simple piano lessons, so you can follow the music better. Promise to do that?\nThis is a good idea\u2014no matter how lousy it may feel to both of us from time to time. It\u2019s like that crazy dieting we did. It will make us love life and each other and the children even more than we do.\nK\nSeptember 28, 1965\n[Iowa City]\nTO JANE VONNEGUT", 0.12332688588007738], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake":

said Trout.\n\u201cYou can stuff it up your ass,\u201d said Prince.\n51\nWhen I liken Trout there in the entrance hall of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, awakening Dudley Prince from PTA, to Dr. Frankenstein, I am alluding of course to the antihero of the novel Frankenstein\u2014or, The Modern Prometheus, by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, second wife of the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. In that book, the scientist Frankenstein puts a bunch of body parts from different corpses together in the shape of a man.\nFrankenstein jazzes them with electricity. The results in the book are exact opposites of those since achieved in real-life American state penitentiaries with real-life electric chairs. Most people think Frankenstein is the monster. He isn\u2019t. Frankenstein is the scientist.\nPrometheus in Greek mythology makes the first human beings from mud. He steals fire from Heaven and gives it to them so they can be warm and cook, and not, one would hope, so we could incinerate all the little yellow bastards in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which are in Japan.\nIn chapter 2 of this wonderful book of mine, I mention a commemoration in the chapel of the University of Chicago of the fiftieth anniversary of the atom-bombing of Hiroshima. I said at the time that I had to respect the opinion of my friend William Styron that the Hiroshima bomb saved his life. Styron was then a United States Marine, training for an invasion of the Japanese home islands, when that bomb was dropped.\nI had to add, though, that I knew a single word that proved our democratic government was capable of committing obscene, gleefully rabid and racist, yahooistic murders of unarmed men, women, and children, murders wholly devoid of military common sense. I said the word. It was a foreign word. That word was Nagasaki.\nWhatever! That, too, was a long, long time ago, and ten years longer ago than that, if you want to count the rerun. What I find worth exclaiming about right now is the continuing applicability to the human condition, years after free will has ceased to be a novelty, of what jazzed Dudley Prince back to life, of what is now known generally as Kilgore\u2019s Creed: \u201cYou were sick, but now you\u2019re well again, and there\u2019s work to do.\u201d", 0.08253676470588235], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["fuller", 0.3030417831541881], ["wished", 0.18232256842131417], ["susanna", 0.1448024796775756], ["soul", 0.10174417378868718], ["foreign", 0.08376615965140138], ["appallingly", 0.08376615965140138], ["smokes", 0.08376615965140138], ["wink", 0.08376615965140138], ["thousandth", 0.08376615965140138], ["daydreams", 0.08376615965140138], ["yellowstone", 0.08376615965140138], ["intimacy", 0.08376615965140138], ["discussing", 0.08376615965140138], ["backing", 0.07386405707197359], ["supported", 0.07386405707197359], ["radiator", 0.07386405707197359], ["affairs", 0.07386405707197359], ["homely", 0.07386405707197359], ["patted", 0.07386405707197359], ["tortured", 0.07386405707197359], ["bosom", 0.06807169838471411], ["holy", 0.06807169838471411], ["passionately", 0.06807169838471411], ["bleak", 0.06807169838471411], ["inch", 0.06396195449254581], ["heat", 0.06396195449254581], ["taxes", 0.06396195449254581], ["trembled", 0.06396195449254581], ["golden", 0.06077418947377138], ["baseball", 0.06077418947377138], ["profound", 0.06077418947377138], ["trembling", 0.058169595805286314], ["thick", 0.058169595805286314], ["belong", 0.05596744323632548], ["night", 0.05409540748702786], ["lonely", 0.05405985191311801], ["park", 0.05405985191311801], ["magazine", 0.049510512897138946], ["iron", 0.049510512897138946], ["expect", 0.049510512897138946], ["talked", 0.04712402597337943], ["throw", 0.04606534065689769], ["filled", 0.04415774933369023], ["sleep", 0.043291683307741156], ["hadn", 0.04170274566330938], ["inside", 0.04170274566330938], ["human", 0.03668277585133954], ["turn", 0.03668277585133954], ["read", 0.03668277585133954], ["living", 0.03517762562765631], ["black", 0.03425564675426244], ["white", 0.03381605163045167], ["girl", 0.03003472942720764], ["called", 0.026518542719508945], ["things", 0.026518542719508945], ["big", 0.025275523048228523], ["life", 0.024132055795749428], ["room", 0.021898540504453803]], "sentiment": ["\"Holy smokes, I never called you those things!\" said Fuller.\n\"Did you ever stop to think what it\u2019s like to be me?\" she said.

He didn\u2019t know where he was. His lips were working, and one of the golliwogs put his ear close to them to hear what might be his dying words.\nBilly thought the golliwog had something to do with World War Two, and he whispered to him his address: \u201cSchlachthof-f\u00fcnf.\u201d\nBilly was brought down Sugarbush Mountain on a toboggan. The golliwogs controlled it with ropes and yodeled melodiously for right-of-way. Near the bottom, the trail swooped around the pylons of a chair lift. Billy looked up at all the young people in bright elastic clothing and enormous boots and goggles, bombed out of their skulls with snow, swinging through the sky in yellow chairs. He supposed that they were part of an amazing new phase of World War Two. It was all right with him. Everything was pretty much all right with Billy.\nHe was taken to a small private hospital. A famous brain surgeon came up from Boston and operated on him for three hours. Billy was unconscious for two days after that, and he dreamed millions of things, some of them true. The true things were time-travel.\nOne of the true things was his first evening in the slaughterhouse. He and poor old Edgar Derby were pushing an empty two-wheeled cart down a dirt lane between empty pens for animals. They were going to a communal kitchen for supper for all. They were guarded by a sixteen-year-old German named Werner Gluck. The axles of the cart were greased with the fat of dead animals. So it goes.\nThe sun had just gone down, and its afterglow was backlighting the city, which formed low cliffs around the bucolic void to the idle stockyards. The city was blacked out because bombers might come, so Billy didn\u2019t get to see Dresden do one of the most cheerful things a city is capable of doing when the sun goes down, which is to wink its lights on one by one.\nThere was a broad river to reflect those lights, which would have made their nighttime winkings very pretty indeed. It was the Elbe.\nWerner Gluck, the young guard, was a Dresden boy. He had never been in the slaughterhouse before, so he wasn\u2019t sure where the kitchen was. He was tall and weak like Billy, might have been a younger brother of his. They were, in fact, distant cousins, something they never found out. Gluck was armed with an incredibly heavy musket, a single-shot museum piece with an octagonal barrel and a smooth bore. He had fixed his bayonet. It was like a long knitting needle. It had no blood gutters.\nGluck led the way to a building that he thought might contain the kitchen, and he opened the sliding door in its side. There wasn\u2019t a kitchen in there, though. There was a dressing room adjacent to a communal shower, and there was a lot of steam. In the steam were about thirty teen-age girls with no clothes on. They were German refugees from Breslau, which had been tremendously bombed. They had just arrived in Dresden, too. Dresden was jammed with refugees.\nThere those girls were with all their private parts bare, for anybody to see. And there in the doorway were Gluck and Derby and Pilgrim\u2014the childish soldier and the poor old high school teacher and the clown in his toga and silver shoes\u2014staring. The girls screamed. They covered themselves with their hands and turned their backs and so on, and made themselves utterly beautiful.", 0.10984369670733307], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["buddy", 0.2280359429766654], ["sewer", 0.0895864306392219], ["thrup", 0.08221433776452801], ["fo", 0.08221433776452801], ["tup", 0.08221433776452801], ["grenade", 0.0729265991506009], ["mother", 0.06549613747769861], ["boaz", 0.06069662353220809], ["board", 0.06032392314042007], ["lucky", 0.05859101078034144], ["unk", 0.05483347357504857], ["pin", 0.05109455332470136], ["hamburg", 0.05109455332470136], ["harness", 0.05109455332470136], ["kits", 0.05109455332470136], ["noncombat", 0.05109455332470136], ["morale", 0.05109455332470136], ["logistical", 0.05109455332470136], ["assignment", 0.05109455332470136], ["chucked", 0.05109455332470136], ["spout", 0.05109455332470136], ["bibles", 0.05109455332470136], ["canned", 0.05109455332470136], ["ers", 0.05109455332470136], ["absently", 0.05109455332470136], ["ship", 0.04503179021975521], ["builders", 0.04479321531961095], ["sporting", 0.04479321531961095], ["confusion", 0.04479321531961095], ["fluke", 0.04479321531961095], ["barber", 0.04479321531961095], ["goods", 0.04479321531961095], ["bleed", 0.04479321531961095], ["essentially", 0.04479321531961095], ["doooooooooommmmmmmmmm", 0.04479321531961095], ["hurled", 0.04479321531961095], ["amid", 0.04479321531961095], ["company", 0.04366409165179907], ["ironing", 0.041107168882264004], ["drinks", 0.041107168882264004], ["mortar", 0.041107168882264004], ["chanted", 0.041107168882264004], ["siege", 0.041107168882264004], ["invasion", 0.041107168882264004], ["arranged", 0.041107168882264004], ["roar", 0.041107168882264004], ["candy", 0.041107168882264004], ["games", 0.041107168882264004], ["pulled", 0.041107168882264004], ["tube", 0.03849187731452054], ["recorded", 0.03849187731452054], ["boards", 0.03849187731452054], ["fixed", 0.03849187731452054], ["holding", 0.03646329957530045], ["takes", 0.03646329957530045], ["note", 0.03480583087717359], ["seconds", 0.03480583087717359], ["start", 0.03480583087717359], ["soft", 0.03340446106056215], ["paper", 0.03340446106056215], ["throat", 0.03219053930943013], ["troops", 0.03219053930943013], ["goofballs", 0.031119784439826638], ["soldiers", 0.031119784439826638], ["street", 0.031119784439826638], ["live", 0.030161961570210036], ["carry", 0.02929550539017072], ["meant", 0.028504492872083176], ["passed", 0.027776831893232847], ["ain", 0.027103123055471738], ["music", 0.026475915132863088], ["die", 0.026475915132863088], ["care", 0.025889201304339717], ["rest", 0.02432692624137009], ["carrying", 0.02432692624137009], ["soldier", 0.02432692624137009], ["men", 0.022590060452618185], ["hand", 0.01711573861303438], ["things", 0.014339541798932725], ["three", 0.011372300120455713], ["good", 0.01060048699512402], ["space", 0.008362913635679398]], "sentiment": ["\"Bleed!

fingers, working in the blacked-out head, now encountered what would prove to be half a bottle of cognac sitting atop the tank of his toilet. This was the last bottle of any sort still aboard the ship, and its contents were the last substance to be found, from stem to stern and from crow\u2019s nest to keel, which a human being could metabolize. In saying that, of course, I exclude the possibility of cannibalism. I ignore the fact that the Captain himself was quite edible.\nAnd just as the Captain\u2019s fingers got a firm grip on the bottle\u2019s neck in the darkness, something big and strong outside gave the Bah\u00eda de Darwin an authoritative bump. Also: There were male voices from the boat deck, one deck below. The thing was: The tugboat crew which had delivered fuel and food to the Colombian freighter San Mateo was now preparing to haul away the Bah\u00eda de Darwin\u2019s two lifeboats. They had cast off the ship\u2019s bowline, and the tug was nosing her bow into the estuary, so that the lifeboat on her starboard side could be lowered into the water.\nSo that the ship was now married to the South American mainland by a single line at her stern. Poetically speaking, that stern line is the white nylon umbilical cord of all modern humankind.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe Captain might as well have been my fellow ghost on the Bah\u00eda de Darwin. The men who took our lifeboats never even suspected that there was another soul aboard.\nAll alone again, except for me, he proceeded to get drunk. What could that matter now? The tugboat, with the lifeboats following obediently, had disappeared upstream. The San Mateo, all lit up like a Christmas tree, and with the radar dish atop her bridge revolving, had disappeared downstream, so that the Captain felt free to shout whatever he pleased from the bridge without attracting unfavorable attention. His hands on the ship\u2019s wheel, he called into the starlit evening, \u201cMan overboard!\u201d He was speaking of himself.\nExpecting nothing to happen, he pressed the starter button for the port engine. From the bowels of the ship came the muffled, deep-purple rumble of a great diesel engine in perfect health. He pressed the other starter button, giving the gift of life to the engine\u2019s identical twin. These dependable, uncomplaining slaves had been born in Columbus, Indiana\u2014not far from Indiana University, where Mary Hepburn had taken her master\u2019s degree in zoology.\nSmall world.\nThat the diesels still worked was to the Captain simply one more reason to make himself wild and stupid with cognac. He switched off the engines, and it was a good thing he did. If he had let them run long enough to get really hot, that temperature anomaly might have attracted the electronic attention of a Peruvian fighter-bomber in the stratosphere. In Vietnam, we had heat-sensing instruments so sensitive that could actually detect the presence of people, or at least big mammals of some kind, in the night\u2014because their bodies were just a little bit warmer than their surroundings.\nOne time I called in an artillery barrage on a water buffalo. Usually it was people out there\u2014trying to sneak up on us and kill us, if they could. What a life!

I own them all. They have a little shelf of honor in the library, and are autographed beneath testimonials as to how close Paul and I have been for so many years. I have read reviews of most of them, and have a pretty good idea of how they go.\nI think Paul knew this about me, although we have certainly never discussed it openly. It is impossible for me to take his writings seriously, knowing how reckless he has been in real life. How can I study his published opinions on love and hate and God and man and whether the ends ever justify the means and all that with solemnity? As for a quid pro quo: I don\u2019t owe him one. He has never honored me as a painter or collector, nor should he have.\nSo what was our bond?\nLoneliness and wounds from World War Two which were quite grave.\nCirce Berman has broken her silence about the mystery of the locked potato barn. She found a big picture book in the library whose spine is split and whose pages are not only dog eared but splotched with painty finger-prints, although it was published only three years ago. It depicts virtually all the uniforms worn by every sort of regular soldier or sailor or airman during World War Two. She asked me point blank if it had anything to do with what was in the barn.\n\u201cMaybe it does and maybe it doesn\u2019t,\u201d I said.\nBut I will tell you a secret: it does, it does.\nSo Marilee and I slouched home from the Museum of Modern Art like whipped children. We laughed sometimes, too, just fell into each other\u2019s arms and laughed and laughed.

They used to call me \"The Beast of Yugoslavia,\" on account of all the people I had tortured and shot--and hanged. We'd bop 'em on the head. We'd hook 'em up to the electricity. We'd stick 'em with hypodermic syringes full of all kinds of stuff. One time we killed a guy with orange juice. There was a train wreck, and two of the freight cars were loaded with oranges, so we had oceans of orange juice. It was a joke--how much orange juice we had. And we were interrogating a guy one day, and he wouldn't talk, and the next thing I know--somebody's filling up this big syringe with orange juice.\n(pause)\nThere was a guerrilla war going on. You couldn't tell who was a guerrilla and who wasn't. Even if you got one, it was still a civilian you got. Telling Americans what a guerrilla war is like--that's coals to Newcastle. How do you like that for idiomatic English? \"Coals to Newcastle.\" (laughs)\nThat Harold Ryan--he says he spoke to me in perfect German? He talks German like my ass chews gum. I'm glad to hear the wonderful thing he said before he killed me. I sure didn't understand it the first time around. I figured he was a Lithuanian or something, which will give you an idea of how wrong you can be. All I knew was he was very proud about something, and he had a machine pistol, and it was aimed at me. The woods were full of all kinds of nuts who were proud of some damn thing or other, and they all had guns. They were always looking for revenge. You find a way to bottle revenge--that's the end of Schnapps und Coca-Cola.

She so seldom misses. She said specifically that you had been a sniper.\"\n\"No.\"\nLance shrugged. \"If not in this life, in some other one, then.\" And he sneered and whinnied again.\nSons of suicides often think of killing themselves at the end of a day, when their blood sugar is low. And so it was with Fred Rosewater when he came home from work. He nearly fell over the Electrolux in the living room archway, caught his balance with a quick stride, barked his shin on a little table, knocked the mints on the table to the floor. He got down on his hands and knees and picked them up.\nHe knew his wife was home, for the record-player Amanita had given to her for her birthday was going. She only owned five records, and they were all in the changer. They were her bonus for joining a record club. She had gone through hell, selecting five free records from a list of one hundred. The five she finally chose were Come Dance With Me, by Frank Sinatra, A Mighty Fortress Is Our God, and Other Sacred Selections, by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir; It's a Long Way to Tipperary and Others, by the Soviet Army Chorus and Band, The New World Symphony, conducted by Leonard Bernstein, and Poems of Dylan Thomas, read by Richard Burton.\nThe Burton record was playing as Fred picked up the mints.\nFred stood up, swayed. There were bells in his ears. There were spots before his eyes. He went into the bedroom, found his wife asleep in bed with her clothes on. She was drunk, and full of chicken and mayonnaise, as she always was after a luncheon with Amanita. Fred tiptoed out again, thought of hanging himself from a pipe in the cellar.\nBut then he remembered his son. He heard a toilet flush, so that was where little Franklin was, in the bathroom. He went into Franklin's bedroom to wait for him. It was the only room in the house where Fred felt really comfortable. The shades were drawn, which was midly puzzling, since there was no reason for the boy to exclude the last of the daylight, and there were no neighbors to peep in.\nThe only light came from a curious lamp on the bedside table. The lamp consisted of a plaster statuette of a blacksmith who had his hammer raised. There was a pane of frosted orange glass behind the blacksmith. And behind the glass was an electric bulb, and over the bulb was a little tin windmill. Hot air rising from the bulb caused the windmill to turn. The bright surfaces of the turning mill made the light playing on the orange glass flicker, made it look a lot like real fire.\nThere was a story that went with the lamp. It was thirty-three years old. The company that made the lamps had been Fred's father's very last speculation.", 0.03766594516594517], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["circulation", 0.18376360795610394], ["manager", 0.14555100661112622], ["presented", 0.09188180397805197], ["avoided", 0.07277550330556311], ["bald", 0.07277550330556311], ["spot", 0.06072076973060754], ["leland", 0.04741220415491119], ["shoepolish", 0.045940901989025985], ["hater", 0.045940901989025985], ["modestly", 0.045940901989025985], ["fringed", 0.045940901989025985], ["gorgon", 0.045940901989025985], ["pate", 0.045940901989025985], ["tonsure", 0.045940901989025985], ["blind", 0.045940901989025985], ["mythological", 0.045940901989025985], ["watchman", 0.045940901989025985], ["breadlines", 0.045940901989025985], ["bowed", 0.045940901989025985], ["14", 0.045940901989025985], ["manfully", 0.045940901989025985], ["handing", 0.045940901989025985], ["perseus", 0.045940901989025985], ["capitalism", 0.045940901989025985], ["working", 0.04067416955776606], ["sparse", 0.0399135352015482], ["improve", 0.0399135352015482], ["responded", 0.0399135352015482], ["factory", 0.039782112264069525], ["clewes", 0.03683485350861124], ["wood", 0.036387751652781554], ["scrawny", 0.036387751652781554], ["progressive", 0.036387751652781554], ["fainted", 0.036387751652781554], ["bay", 0.036387751652781554], ["loudly", 0.036387751652781554], ["senior", 0.036387751652781554], ["kathleen", 0.035253341635139025], ["mary", 0.03474678287364942], ["gates", 0.03388616841407042], ["cheerful", 0.03388616841407042], ["silver", 0.03388616841407042], ["radium", 0.03388616841407042], ["faced", 0.03388616841407042], ["visible", 0.03388616841407042], ["poisoning", 0.03388616841407042], ["head", 0.0321602873783103], ["cambridge", 0.03194578970699033], ["tough", 0.03194578970699033], ["directly", 0.03194578970699033], ["dollar", 0.03036038486530377], ["hearing", 0.03036038486530377], ["bright", 0.03036038486530377], ["absolutely", 0.03036038486530377], ["hair", 0.03036038486530377], ["alcohol", 0.03036038486530377], ["highly", 0.03036038486530377], ["drinking", 0.029019944171153698], ["condition", 0.029019944171153698], ["closed", 0.029019944171153698], ["agreed", 0.027858801626592634], ["hope", 0.027858801626592634], ["red", 0.027858801626592634], ["tiny", 0.027858801626592634], ["blue", 0.026834601316537122], ["size", 0.025918422919512546], ["start", 0.025918422919512546], ["wyatt", 0.025918422919512546], ["charge", 0.025089638747301024], ["paper", 0.022392639370745898], ["met", 0.022392639370745898], ["clock", 0.02033708477888303], ["class", 0.02033708477888303], ["office", 0.019891056132034762], ["women", 0.019891056132034762], ["good", 0.01982728699732967], ["state", 0.019466793834909266], ["eyes", 0.019062271959823244], ["left", 0.018675734893989902], ["woman", 0.017609627745360925], ["wasn", 0.016965210596198127], ["white", 0.016965210596198127], ["died", 0.01666006868479578], ["mother", 0.016365272583268115], ["year", 0.015536488411056594], ["turned", 0.01430971799140524], ["night", 0.013863689344556977], ["thing", 0.013863689344556977], ["company", 0.013863689344556977], ["father", 0.012648368106512117], ["walter", 0.012461357626329824], ["long", 0.012278284502870414], ["told", 0.00643399083885204]], "sentiment": ["14\n\u201cI WAS HIS CIRCULATION MANAGER,\u201d said Mary Kathleen to Leland Clewes very loudly. \u201cWasn\u2019t I a good circulation manager, Walter?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014you certainly were,\u201d I said. That was how we met: She presented herself at the tiny office of The Bay State Progressive in Cambridge at the start of my senior year, saying that she would do absolutely anything I told her to do, as long as it would improve the condition of the working class. I made her circulation manager, put her in charge of handing out the paper at factory gates and along breadlines and so on. She had been a scrawny little thing back then, but tough and cheerful and highly visible because of her bright red hair.

Her father had gone blind after drinking wood alcohol while a night watchman in a shoepolish factory.\nNow what was left of Mary Kathleen bowed her head, responded modestly to my having agreed that she had been a good circulation manager, and presented her pate to Leland Clewes and me.

It could detonate its own farts and knock over other bugs with shock waves.\nWord of Honor\u2014I read about it in an article on strange animals in Diners\u2019 Club Magazine.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo Francine got off the bed in order not to share it with the seeming rattlesnake. She was aghast. All she could say over and over again was, \u201cYou\u2019re my man. You\u2019re my man.\u201d This meant that she was willing to agree about anything with Dwayne, to do anything for him, no matter how difficult or disgusting, to think up nice things to do for him that he didn\u2019t even notice, to die for him, if necessary, and so on.\nShe honestly tried to live that way. She couldn\u2019t imagine anything better to do. So she fell apart when Dwayne persisted in his nastiness. He told her that every woman was a whore, and every whore had her price, and Francine\u2019s price was what a Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise would cost, which would be well over one hundred thousand dollars by the time adequate parking and exterior lighting and all that was taken into consideration, and so on.", -0.005544077134986212], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"},

a few weeks before. The Americans went inside, kicking their way through rubbish and splintered furniture. For a while, there was nothing to see through my window. I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s over, the killing is all over,\u201d I said, \u201cand we\u2019re alive. Did you think that was possible? Did anyone in his right mind expect to be alive when it was over?\u201d\n\u201cI feel almost as though being alive were something to be ashamed of,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe world will probably feel that way for a long, long time. You can at least thank God you\u2019ve come through it all with very little guilt in all the killing. Having been helpless in the middle has that advantage. Think of the guilt on the shoulders of the Americans\u2014a hundred thousand dead in the Moscow bombings, fifty thousand in Kiev\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the guilt of the Russians?\u201d she said passionately.\n\u201cNo\u2014not the Russians. That\u2019s one of the joys of losing a war. You surrender your guilt along with your capital, and join the ranks of the innocent little people.\u201d\nThe cat rubbed her flanks against my wooden leg and purred. I suppose most men with wooden legs conceal the fact as best they can. I lost my left leg as an Austrian infantryman in 1916, and I wear one trouser leg higher than the other to show off the handsome oak peg I made for myself after World War I. Carved in the peg are the images of Georges Clemenceau, David Lloyd George, and Woodrow Wilson, who helped the Czech Republic rise from the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1919, when I was twenty-five. And below these images are two more, each within a wreath: Tom\u00e1\u0161; Masaryk and Eduard Bene\u0161;, the first leaders of the Republic. There are other faces that should be added, and now, now that peace is with us once again, perhaps I\u2019ll carve them. The only carving I\u2019ve done on the peg in the past thirty years is crude and obscure, and maybe barbaric\u2014three deep nicks near the iron tip, for the three German officers whose car I sent down a mountainside one night in 1943, during the Nazi occupation.\nThese men across the street weren\u2019t the first Americans I\u2019d seen. I owned a furniture factory in Prague during the days of the Republic, and I did a great deal of business with buyers for American department stores. When the Nazis came, I lost my factory, and moved to Beda, this quiet town in the foothills of Sudetenland. My wife died soon after that, of the rarest of causes, the natural ones. Then I had only my daughter, Marta.\nNow, praise God, I was seeing Americans again\u2014after the Nazis, after the Russian Army of World War II, after the Czech communists, after the Russians again. Knowing this day was coming had kept me alive. Hidden under the floorboards of my workshop was a bottle of Scotch that had constantly tried my willpower. But I left it in its hidingplace. It was to be my present to the Americans when they finally came.\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming out,\u201d said Marta.", 0.04671062869592283], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
