But, under Cuthrell\u2019s and Barker\u2019s nagging to do so, he began to hedge. At first he declared that the information could be passed on simply by word of mouth. Later he said that it would have to be written up in a long report. Finally, at dinner one night, just after General Barker had read the secret orders for Operation Brainstorm, the professor announced, \"The report may take as long as five years to write.\" He looked fiercely at the general, \"Maybe twenty.\"\nThe dismay occasioned by this flat announcement was offset somewhat by the exciting anticipation of Operation Brainstorm. The general was in a holiday mood. \"The target ships are on their way to the Caroline Islands at this very moment,\" he declared ecstatically. \"One hundred and twenty of them! At the same time, ten V-2s are being readied for firing in New Mexico, and fifty radio-controlled jet bombers are being equipped for a mock attack on the Aleutians. Just think of it!\" Happily he reviewed his orders. \"At exactly 1100 hours next Wednesday, I will give you the order to concentrate; and you, professor, will think as hard as you can about sinking the target ships, destroying the V-2s before they hit the ground, and knocking down bombers before they reach the Aleutians! Think you can handle it?\"\nThe professor turned gray and closed his eyes. \"As I told you before, my friend, I don\u2019t know what I can do.\" He added bitterly, \"As for this Operation Brainstorm, I was never consulted about it, and it strikes me as childish and insanely expensive.\"\nGeneral Barker bridled. \"Sir,\" he said, \"your field is psychology, and I wouldn\u2019t presume to give you advice in that field. Mine is national defense. I have had thirty years of experience and success, Professor, and I\u2019ll ask you not to criticize my judgment.\"\nThe professor appealed to Mr. Cuthrell. \"Look,\" he pleaded, \"isn\u2019t it war and military matters we\u2019re all trying to get rid of? Wouldn\u2019t it be a whole lot more significant and lots cheaper for me to try moving cloud masses into drought areas, and things like that? I admit I know next to nothing about international politics, but it seems reasonable to suppose that nobody would want to fight wars if there were enough of everything to go around. Mr. Cuthrell, I\u2019d like to try running generators where there isn\u2019t any coal or water power, irrigating deserts, and so on. Why, you could figure out what each country needs to make the most of its resources, and I could give it to them without costing American taxpayers a penny.\"\n\"Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom,\" said the general heavily.\nMr. Cuthrell threw the general a look of mild distaste. \"Unfortunately, the general is right in his own way,\" he said. \"I wish to heaven the world were ready for ideals like yours, but it simply isn\u2019t. We aren\u2019t surrounded by brothers, but by enemies. It isn\u2019t a lack of food or resources that has us on the brink of war\u2014it\u2019s a struggle for power. Who\u2019s going to be in charge of the world, our kind of people or theirs?\"\nThe professor nodded in reluctant agreement and arose from the table. \"I beg your pardon, gentlemen. You are, after all, better qualified to judge what is best for the country. I\u2019ll do whatever you say.\" He turned to me. \"Don\u2019t forget to wind the restricted clock and put the confidential cat out,\" he said gloomily, and ascended the stairs to his bedroom.\nFor reasons of national security, Operation Brainstorm was carried on without the knowledge of the American citizenry which was paying the bill. The observers, technicians, and military men involved in the activity knew that a test was under way\u2014a test of what, they had no idea. Only thirty-seven key men, myself included, knew what was afoot.\nIn Virginia, the day for Operation Brainstorm was unseasonably cool. Inside, a log fire crackled in the fireplace, and the flames were reflected in the polished metal cabinets that lined the living room. All that remained of the room\u2019s lovely old furniture was a Victorian love seat, set squarely in the center of the floor, facing three television receivers. One long bench had been brought in for the ten of us privileged to watch.
