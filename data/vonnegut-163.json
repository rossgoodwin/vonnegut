We climbed the slope of Mount McCabe. The air grew cooler. There was mist.\nFrank\u2019s house had once been the home of Nestor Aamons, father of Mona, architect of the House of Hope and Mercy in the Jungle.\nAamons had designed it.\nIt straddled a waterfall; had a terrace cantilevered out into the mist rising from the fall. It was a cunning lattice of very light steel posts and beams. The interstices of the lattice were variously open, chinked with native stone, glazed, or curtained by sheets of canvas.\nThe effect of the house was not so much to enclose as to announce that a man had been whimsically busy there.\nA servant greeted me politely and told me that Frank wasn\u2019t home yet. Frank was expected at any moment. Frank had left orders to the effect that I was to be made happy and comfortable, and that I was to stay for supper and the night. The servant, who introduced himself as Stanley, was the first plump San Lorenzan I had seen.\nStanley led me to my room; led me around the heart of the house, down a staircase of living stone, a staircase sheltered or exposed by steel-framed rectangles at random. My bed was a foam-rubber slab on a stone shelf, a shelf of living stone. The walls of my chamber were canvas. Stanley demonstrated how I might roll them up or down, as I pleased.\nI asked Stanley if anybody else was home, and he told me that only Newt was. Newt, he said, was out on the cantilevered terrace, painting a picture. Angela, he said, had gone sightseeing to the House of Hope and Mercy in the Jungle.\nI went out onto the giddy terrace that straddled the waterfall and found little Newt asleep in a yellow butterfly chair.\nThe painting on which Newt had been working was set on an easel next to the aluminum railing.

So that game old lady went right in after it.

He didn\u2019t even know what part of the world he was in. The most alarming thing to him was that he was being attacked by birds. These were harmless vampire finches going after his bedsores, some of the commonest birds on the island. But to him they were new and terrifying.\nHe slapped at them, and cried out for help. More and more finches kept coming, and he was so convinced that they meant to kill him that he jumped into the water, where he was eaten by a hammerhead shark. This animal had its eyes on the ends of stalks, a design perfected by the Law of Natural Selection many, many millions of years ago. It was a flawless part in the clockwork of the universe. There was no defect in it which might yet be modified. One thing it surely did not need was a bigger brain.\nWhat was it going to do with a bigger brain?

One night, while the raft was tied up near Manaus, the old rubber boom town in Brazil, a speedboat came alongside. At the wheel was Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the Soviet poet. He had Brazilian friends along. He asked in English if he and his party could come aboard the raft for drinks. In exchange, he said, he would give his hosts a perfect name for their raft.\nSo there was some drinking on the raft, and fighting for some reason broke out between Yevtushenko and Jim.\nSo the party was over, and the visitors got back in their speedboat. Just before they cast off, Yevtushenko said: \u201cI have not forgotten my promise. You should call your raft The Huckleberry Finn.\u201d\nYears later I myself would meet Yevtushenko, and I would ask him if the story was true.\n\u201cAh!\u201d he said. \u201cAh! That was your son?
