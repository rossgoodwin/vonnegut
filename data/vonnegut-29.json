are big enough to let us adapt to the inevitable pratfalls and buffoonery,\u201d he went on, \u201cby means of manmade epiphanies like this one.\u201d He meant the clambake on a beach under a starry sky. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t nice, what is?\u201d he said.\nHe declared the corn on the cob, steamed in seaweed with lobsters and clams, to be heavenly. He added, \u201cAnd don\u2019t all the ladies look like angels tonight!\u201d He was feasting on corn on the cob and women as ideas. He couldn\u2019t eat the corn because the upper plate of his false teeth was insecure. His long-term relationships with women had been disasters. In the only love story he ever attempted, \u201cKiss Me Again,\u201d he had written, \u201cThere is no way a beautiful woman can live up to what she looks like for any appreciable length of time.\u201d\nThe moral at the end of that story is this: \u201cMen are jerks. Women are psychotic.\u201d\nChief among manmade epiphanies for me have been stage plays. Trout called them \u201cartificial timequakes.\u201d He said, \u201cBefore Earthlings knew there were such things as timequakes in Nature, they invented them.\u201d And it\u2019s true. Actors know everything they are going to say and do, and how everything is going to come out in the end, for good or ill, when the curtain goes up on Act One, Scene One. Yet they have no choice but to behave as though the future were a mystery.\nYes, and when the timequake of 2001 zapped us back to 1991, it made ten years of our pasts ten years of our futures, so we could remember everything we had to say and do again when the time came.\nKeep this in mind at the start of the next rerun after the next timequake: The show must go on!\nThe artificial timequake that has moved me most so far this year is an old one. It is Our Town, by the late Thornton Wilder. I had already watched it with undiminished satisfaction maybe five or six times. And then this spring my thirteen-year-old daughter, dear Lily, was cast as a talking dead person in the graveyard of Grover\u2019s Corners in a school production of that innocent, sentimental masterpiece.\nThe play zapped Lily and her schoolmates from the evening of the performance back to May 7th, 1901! Timequake! They were robots of Thornton Wilder\u2019s imaginary past until the curtain came down after the funeral of the heroine Emily in the very last scene. Only then could they live in 1996 again. Only then could they again decide for themselves what to say or do next. Only then could they exercise free will again.\nI reflected sadly that night, with Lily pretending to be a dead grownup, that I would be seventy-eight when she graduated from high school, and eighty-two when she graduated from college, and so on.

And Harry and Helene set such a pace that everybody in the production was half crazy with excitement and exhaustion before we\u2019d rehearsed four times. Usually a director has to beg people to learn their lines, but I had no such trouble. Harry and Helene were working so well together that everybody else in the cast regarded it as a duty and an honor and a pleasure to support them.\nI was certainly lucky\u2014or thought I was. Things were going so well, so hot and heavy, so early in the game that I had to say to Harry and Helene after one love scene, \"Hold a little something back for the actual performance, would you please? You\u2019ll burn yourselves out.\"\nI said that at the fourth or fifth rehearsal, and Lydia Miller, who was playing Blanche, the faded sister, was sitting next to me in the audience. In real life, she\u2019s the wife of Verne Miller. Verne owns Miller\u2019s Hardware Store. Verne was Harry\u2019s boss.\n\"Lydia,\" I said to her, \"have we got a play or have we got a play?\"\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"you\u2019ve got a play, all right.\" She made it sound as though I\u2019d committed some kind of crime, done something just terrible. \"You should be very proud of yourself.\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\" I said.\nBefore Lydia could answer, Harry yelled at me from the stage, asked if I was through with him, asked if he could go home. I told him he could and, still Marlon Brando, he left, kicking furniture out of his way and slamming doors. Helene was left all alone on the stage, sitting on a couch with the same gaga look she\u2019d had after the tryouts. That girl was drained.\nI turned to Lydia again and I said, \"Well\u2014until now, I thought I had every reason to be happy and proud.

Father stopped traveling. According to my brother Felix, who was an eighth-grader at the time, Father wouldn\u2019t even leave the house or talk on the telephone, or look at his mail for three months or more. He went into such a deep depression that it was feared that he might commit suicide, so that Mother took the gun-room key from his key ring. He never missed it. He had no inclination to visit his beloved firearms.\nFelix says that Father might have crashed like that, no matter what was really going on in the outside world. But the mail and telephone calls he was receiving were getting meaner all the time, and G-men had visited him, and suggested that he register as an agent for a foreign power, in order to comply with the law of the land. The man who had been his best man at his wedding, John Fortune, had stopped speaking to him, and had been going around town, to Father\u2019s certain knowledge, declaring Father to be a dangerous nincompoop.\nWhich Father surely was.\nFortune himself was of totally Germanic extraction. His last name was simply an Anglicization of the German word for luck, which is Gl\u00fcck.\nFortune would never give Father an opportunity to mend the rupture between them, for, in 1938, he suddenly took off for the Himalayas, in search of far higher happiness and wisdom than was available, evidently, in Midland City, Ohio. His wife had died of cancer. He was childless. There had been some defect in his or his wife\u2019s reproductive apparatus. The family dairy farm went bankrupt, and was taken over by the Midland County National Bank.\nAnd John Fortune is buried now in bib overalls\u2014in the capital city of Nepal, which is Katmandu.\n6\nMIDLAND CITY has now been depopulated by a neutron bomb explosion.

"sentiment": ["\u201cA little,\u201d said Haley, sucking in air between his teeth.\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Annie, plainly satisfied. \u201cShows it\u2019s doing some good.\u201d\nV.\n\u201cQuite a ruckus last night, eh?\u201d called Mr. Banghart to Haley, above the rattling and creaking of the empty wagon on its way to the fields. Haley sat on the rear corner of the wagon, kicking dispiritedly at the fragile white heads of milkweeds lining the lane. He did not hear Mr. Banghart\u2019s question; his senses were turned inward, examining his conscience.\nAnnie had aroused him this morning, and reminded him that he and Mr. Banghart were to work today, even though it was Sunday. The radio had predicted rain, she had said, and the hay bales would be too heavy to lift, too wet to store, if they were not brought in before the downpour. The General and Hope still slumbered, and Annie had returned to bed after warming coffee left over from the night before, and after laying out a bowl of cold cereal and an orange for Haley\u2019s breakfast. He had met Mr. Banghart in the barn, and done what he could to help harness Caesar and Delores. The coffee had purged him of his sleepiness, giving him in its stead a keen, tense wakefulness.\nHe was willing to admit that he had done a bad thing in helping Kitty elope with the somewhat substandard Roy Flemming. He did then, for his own good, as the General had said, deserve to be punished. But he searched his conscience in vain for a grain of remorse to justify the desolating punishment the General had promised. \u201cWhen you punish somebody, you take something away from them that they want,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cAll I had in the whole wide world was my music, so that\u2019s what I lost \u2014 everything.\u201d\nAs he reviewed his condition again and again in the light of a spotless conscience, he found himself starting to derive from it the pungent, bittersweet pleasure of righteous indignation. Another thought, however, nagging on the fringes of his consciousness, soon came into view to spoil his pleasure. He lived again his ignominious flight from the secret room in the loft, and his abandoning of Hope, and his spirits tumbled into depths of recrimination.\nHe looked up at Mr. Banghart, and wondered how he had found out about the turmoil of the night before. \u201cProbably watched it all through the windows,\u201d he thought. \u201cHope said he did a lot of that.\u201d\n\u201cHorses seem pretty frisky this morning,\u201d said Mr. Banghart, tugging gently on the reins to slow the pace of Caesar and Delores. Haley stood up and walked to Mr. Banghart\u2019s side. He saw that the corners of the horses\u2019 mouths were raw, and that every pull on the edged bits made them swing their heads wildly from side to side.\nMr. Banghart took out his hunting knife and began shaving fat splinters from a wagonstake. The cuts were effortless, Haley noted, with a youngster\u2019s admiration for a keen edge. \u201cThere\u2019s a great day coming,\u201d his companion crooned. \u201cThere are a lot of people around who are going to be wishing they had been a lot nicer to old Bing.\u201d He winked and returned the knife to its case. \u201cA man can stand so much and no more, and they\u2019re all going to have to learn that the hard way.\u201d", 0.027771493212669682], "title": "Basic Training"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["crucifix", 0.11600647021537397], ["wounds", 0.08700485266153048], ["ditch",

read in books,\u201d said Weary. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that out.\u201d\nBilly made no reply to this, either, there in the ditch, since he didn\u2019t want the conversation to go on any longer than necessary. He was dimly tempted to say, though, that he knew a thing or two about gore. Billy, after all, had contemplated torture and hideous wounds at the beginning and the end of nearly every day of his childhood. Billy had an extremely gruesome crucifix hanging on the wall of his little bedroom in Ilium. A military surgeon would have admired the clinical fidelity of the artist\u2019s rendition of all Christ\u2019s wounds\u2014the spear wound, the thorn wounds, the holes that were made by the iron spikes. Billy\u2019s Christ died horribly. He was pitiful.\nSo it goes.\nBilly wasn\u2019t a Catholic, even though he grew up with a ghastly crucifix on the wall. His father had no religion. His mother was a substitute organist for several churches around town. She took Billy with her whenever she played, taught him to play a little, too. She said she was going to join a church as soon as she decided which one was right.\nShe never did decide. She did develop a terrific hankering for a crucifix, though. And she bought one from a Santa Fe gift shop during a trip the little family made out West during the Great Depression. Like so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops.\nAnd the crucifix went up on the wall of Billy Pilgrim.\nThe two scouts, loving the walnut stocks of their rifles in the ditch, whispered that it was time to move out again. Ten minutes had gone by without anybody\u2019s coming to see if they were hit or not, to finish them off. Whoever had shot was evidently far away and all alone.\nAnd the four crawled out of the ditch without drawing any more fire. They crawled into a forest like the big, unlucky mammals they were. Then they stood up and began to walk quickly. The forest was dark and old. The pines were planted in ranks and files. There was no undergrowth. Four inches of unmarked snow blanketed the ground. The Americans had no choice but to leave trails in the snow as unambiguous as diagrams in a book on ballroom dancing\u2014step, slide, rest\u2014step, slide, rest.\n\u201cClose it up and keep it closed!\u201d Roland Weary warned Billy Pilgrim as they moved out.

The train of the gown cascaded down the top riser, making Beatrice continuous with the architecture of the mansion.\nIt was her tall, straight figure that mattered most in the display. The details of her face were insignificant. A cannonball, substituted for her head, would have suited the grand composition as well.\nBut Beatrice did have a face\u2014and an interesting one. It could be said that she looked like a buck-toothed Indian brave. But anyone who said that would have to add quickly that she looked marvelous. Her face, like the face of Malachi Constant, was a one-of-a-kind, a surprising variation on a familiar theme\u2014a variation that made observers think, Yes\u2014that would be another very nice way for people to look. What Beatrice had done with her face, actually, was what any plain girl could do. She had overlaid it with dignity, suffering, intelligence, and a piquant dash of bitchiness.\n\"Yes,\" said Constant from below, \"that Mr. Constant is still here.\" He was in plain view, leaning against a column in the arch that opened onto the foyer.

computer genius, and his pregnant wife Hisako, the teacher of ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging.\nHer neighbors on the other side were Selena MacIntosh, the blind, teenage daughter of *Andrew MacIntosh, and Kazakh, her seeing-eye dog, also a female. Mary had heard no barking, because Kazakh never barked.\nKazakh never barked or played with other dogs or investigated interesting smells or noises or chased animals which had been the natural prey of her ancestors because, when she was a puppy, big-brained human beings had showed her hate and withheld food whenever she did any of those things. They let her know from the first that that was the kind of planet she was on: that natural canine activities were against the law\u2014all of them.\nThey removed her sex organs so that she would never be distracted by sexual urgencies. And I was about to say that the cast of my story would soon boil down to just one male and a lot of females, including a female dog. But Kazakh wasn\u2019t really a female anymore, thanks to surgery. Like Mary Hepburn, she was out of the evolutionary game. She wasn\u2019t going to leave her genes to anyone.\nBeyond Selena and Kazakh\u2019s room, with an open connecting door, lay the quarters of Selena\u2019s lusty father, the financier and adventurer *Andrew MacIntosh. He was a widower. He and the widow Mary Hepburn might have got along quite nicely, since they were such ardent outdoors people. But they would never meet. As I have already said, *Andrew MacIntosh and *Zenji Hiroguchi would be dead before the sun went down.\nJames Wait, incidentally, had been given a room all alone on the second floor as far as possible from the other guests. His big brain was congratulating him on seeming harmless and ordinary, but it was wrong about that. The hotel manager had spotted Wait as a crook of some kind.\nThis hotel manager, whose name was *Siegfried von Kleist, was a lugubrious, middle-aged member of the old and generally prosperous German community in Ecuador. His two paternal uncles in Quito owned the hotel and the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, too, and they had put him in charge of the hotel for only two weeks, a period drawing to a close now, to oversee the reception of the passengers for \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century.\u201d He was generally an idler, having inherited considerable money, but had been shamed by his uncles into, so to speak, \u201cpulling his own weight\u201d in this particular family enterprise.\nHe was unmarried and had never reproduced, and so was insignificant from an evolutionary point of view. He might also have been considered as a marriage possibility for Mary Hepburn. But he, too, was doomed. *Siegfried von Kleist would survive the sunset, but three hours after that he would be drowned by a tidal wave.\nIt was now four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. This native Ecuadorian Hun, with his watery blue eyes and drooping moustache, actually looked as though he expected to die that evening, but he could no more foretell the future than I could. Both of us felt that afternoon that the planet was wobbling on its axis, and that anything could happen next.\n*Zenji Hiroguchi and *Andrew MacIntosh, incidentally, would die of gunshot wounds.", 0.02375283446712018], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["bears", 0.1371997193465534], ["bear", 0.12045133823947174], ["john", 0.10117964430825473], ["basement", 0.06881058390860627], ["flow", 0.0685998596732767], ["sixty", 0.05252069159111726], ["luxe", 0.04456154707010577], ["sateen", 0.0433466622807005], ["dura", 0.0433466622807005], ["semicolons", 0.04330494859621302], ["cupboards", 0.04330494859621302], ["letting", 0.04330494859621302], ["wyoming", 0.04330494859621302], ["treed", 0.04330494859621302], ["grizzly", 0.04330494859621302], ["cranny", 0.04330494859621302], ["special", 0.04330494859621302], ["motel", 0.04330494859621302], ["expressed", 0.04330494859621302], ["nook", 0.04330494859621302], ["chop", 0.04330494859621302], ["disposal", 0.04330494859621302], ["footsteps", 0.04330494859621302], ["platonic", 0.04330494859621302], ["sections", 0.04330494859621302], ["degrade", 0.04330494859621302], ["pitchfork", 0.04330494859621302], ["gallons", 0.04330494859621302], ["closing", 0.04330494859621302], ["sits", 0.04330494859621302], ["drawers", 0.04330494859621302], ["investigated", 0.04330494859621302], ["yellowstone", 0.04330494859621302], ["curiosity", 0.04330494859621302], ["hear", 0.03834040573068112], ["acres", 0.037623414329328225], ["nosy", 0.037623414329328225], ["dump", 0.037623414329328225], ["opening", 0.037623414329328225], ["dispose", 0.037623414329328225], ["customer", 0.037623414329328225], ["reads", 0.037623414329328225], ["deadly", 0.037623414329328225], ["counted", 0.037623414329328225], ["poison", 0.03429992983663835], ["knowledge", 0.03429992983663835], ["father", 0.032753115003849864], ["lots", 0.03194188006244343], ["area", 0.03194188006244343], ["invited", 0.030112834559867935], ["legally", 0.030112834559867935], ["relationship", 0.030112834559867935], ["park", 0.030112834559867935], ["rid", 0.030112834559867935], ["ship", 0.030112834559867935], ["belong", 0.030112834559867935], ["typewriter", 0.030112834559867935], ["returned", 0.028618395569753555], ["sounds", 0.028618395569753555], ["feeling", 0.028618395569753555], ["permission", 0.027354865407235043], ["ready", 0.027354865407235043], ["stuff", 0.02626034579555863], ["island", 0.02626034579555863], ["listen", 0.02626034579555863], ["glad", 0.02626034579555863], ["ordinary", 0.02626034579555863], ["big", 0.025336624761551154], ["reading", 0.02529491107706368], ["moving", 0.02529491107706368], ["baltimore", 0.024431300292983137], ["law", 0.024431300292983137], ["promised", 0.023650069310980477], ["leave", 0.022936861302868757], ["including", 0.022936861302868757], ["damn", 0.022936861302868757], ["dear", 0.020578811528673833], ["age", 0.020578811528673833], ["sold", 0.020081888399030925], ["hands", 0.019613376810178888], ["books", 0.018749766026098343], ["house", 0.018689655776171408], ["edith", 0.01796853504409568], ["read", 0.01760417633449868], ["berman", 0.01719831514984802], ["better", 0.016599239268168087], ["book", 0.016599239268168087], ["sort", 0.016289892317489015], ["potato", 0.01599179687346545], ["husband", 0.01570416310452061], ["god", 0.014897277261789035], ["barn", 0.013931842543294087], ["day", 0.01348866859845576], ["thing", 0.01247543945118382], ["three", 0.01076157225562186], ["long", 0.010608358050604215], ["man", 0.008840254994647724], ["war", 0.008025726520769006], ["years", 0.007594220508593416], ["time", 0.006064827430065448]], "sentiment": ["One war to a customer.\nMy potato barn and the six acres that came with it used to belong to Big John\u2019s father, who sold them to Dear Edith and her first husband.\nBig John expressed curiosity about Mrs. Berman.

They were country boys from Middle America, and both of them made the American people laugh at themselves and appreciate really important, really moral jokes. Imagine what they would have to say today.\nOne of the most humiliated and heartbroken pieces Mark Twain ever wrote was about the slaughter of six hundred Moro men, women, and children by our soldiers during our liberation of the people of the Philippines after the Spanish-American War. Our brave commander was Leonard Wood, who now has a fort named after him. Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri.\nWhat did Abraham Lincoln have to say about America\u2019s imperialist wars, the ones that, on one noble pretext or another, aim to increase the natural resources and pools of tame labor available to the richest Americans who have the best political connections?\nIt is almost always a mistake to mention Abraham Lincoln. He always steals the show. I am about to quote him again.\nMore than a decade before his Gettysburg Address, back in 1848, when Lincoln was only a Congressman, he was heartbroken and humiliated by our war on Mexico, which had never attacked us. James Polk was the person Representative Lincoln had in mind when he said what he said. Abraham Lincoln said of Polk, his president, his armed forces\u2019 commander-in-chief:\nTrusting to escape scrutiny, by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory\u2014that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood\u2014that serpent\u2019s eye, that charms to destroy\u2014he plunged into war.\nHoly shit! And I thought I was a writer!\nDo you know we actually captured Mexico City during the Mexican War? Why isn\u2019t that a national holiday? And why isn\u2019t the face of James Polk, then our president, up on Mount Rushmore along with Ronald Reagan\u2019s? What made Mexico so evil back in the 1840s, well before our Civil War, is that slavery was illegal there. Remember the Alamo? With that war we were making California our own, and a lot of other people and properties, and doing it as though butchering Mexican soldiers who were only defending their homeland against invaders wasn\u2019t murder. What other stuff besides California? Well, Texas, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and parts of New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming.\nSpeaking of plunging into war, do you know why I think George W. Bush is so pissed off at Arabs? They brought us algebra. Also the numbers we use, including a symbol for nothing, which Europeans had never had before. You think Arabs are dumb? Try doing long division with Roman numerals.\n8", 0.10097566574839302], "title": "A Man without a Country"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["albert", 0.05566551324483865], ["stage", 0.034984143250176736],

my humble opinion, contributed substantially to my mother\u2019s eventual suicide. As I have said, he was the son of the limping Civil War Veteran. When his father retired to Dusseldorf, Albert remained in Indianapolis to run the brewery that his father had sold to a British syndicate. He was born in 1863.\nWhen I got to know him, there wasn\u2019t much to know. He was in bed all the time with a flabby heart. He might as well have been a Martian. What do I remember about him? His mouth was slackly open. It was very pink inside.\nHe was often in London on business when he was young. \u201cHe had his clothes tailored in Savile Row,\u201d says Uncle John, \u201cand was the very model of Victorian sartorial elegance: broadcloth Prince Albert coats, silk hats, Scotch tweeds, starched shirts and collars, and handmade boots. He was handsome, friendly, and highly sociable. He loved parties, good eating, and fine wines. He was always much involved in a series of love affairs, passing feminine attachments, and ribald entertainment.\n\u201cThe brewery was under the general supervision of a retired British army officer\u2014Colonel Thompson\u2014who visited Indianapolis every year or two to look things over and report back to London. He and Albert between them milked the local operation of most of the profits of the brewery through padded expense accounts, sales promotion schemes, public relations departments, political contributions and other devices to skim the cream off the profits. The syndicate demanded a five percent return upon its investment and got it. Albert and his cohorts lined their pockets.\n\u201cIn contrast to his father, who was conservative, retiring, and extremely modest and unassuming, Albert was extroverted, flamboyant, sociable, and a big spender. He always lived on a very lavish scale in various large houses with lots of servants, horses, and carriages and then the earliest and finest motor cars. In his heyday he always had an English butler and a footman in livery. He entertained his friends without thought of cost: the choicest viands, rare wines, flowers, the whitest linens, and choicest porcelain chinaware.\n\u201cHe soon acquired the reputation of a millionaire who counted the cost of nothing. He became a jolly companion of the town\u2019s Tun boys\u2019 who consisted of other rich men\u2019s sons, among them Booth Tarkington. They gave fabulous parties. One of them owned the English Hotel on Monument Circle and English\u2019s Opera House where all the principal traveling shows played. He had a stage box reserved for his use on the right side of the house where he had a door which connected to the stage. This gave him and his cronies access to the stage and easy opportunity to meet actresses and particularly the chorus girls with musical comedies.\n\u201cAt other times they would take over for the night the leading bagnio of the town\u2014facetiously known as the University Club Annex\u2014which was situated on the east side of New Jersey Street about two blocks north of Washington Street. No cash changed hands to sully the dignified atmosphere of the Annex. Each month its devotees were billed discreetly for their share of maintenance. Here the local \u2019fun boys\u2019 would stage real bacchanalian orgies which provided choice and juicy gossip for the staid community. But they always committed their indiscretions, with due respect for the Victorian proprieties, in privacy behind doors\u2014which is what doors are for.\n\u201cOne of their charming folkways was to initiate congenial spirits into what they called their \u2019W-A Club.\u2019 Preceding an elaborate dinner at one of the clubs or hotels, the neophyte would be blindfolded and seated on a cool, fresh keg of Lieber\u2019s beer to which a spigot and faucet had been attached. At the turn of the faucet the beer would squirt out and drench the candidate. He was then said to have a wet ass and was qualified to be admitted to their fellowship. They even had a gold button made by a jeweler which could be worn on the coat lapel with the insignia \u2019W-A.\u2019 They were real devotees of sport and always chartered a private Pullman car to take them to championship prizefights, horse races, and other sporting events. They never used drugs or much profanity, and always respected respectable women. They were always suitably attired and were uniformly well-mannered and gentlemanly.\u201d", 0.16242158426368952], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["wintry", 0.1582095504862439], ["advance", 0.1582095504862439], ["industry", 0.1582095504862439], ["principal", 0.13840534532738832], ["kisses", 0.13840534532738832], ["hartford", 0.13840534532738832], ["5", 0.12682062795286933], ["designed", 0.12682062795286933], ["understood", 0.11860114016853274], ["stenographer", 0.11860114016853274], ["breed", 0.11222561013098388], ["everett", 0.11222561013098388], ["wives", 0.11222561013098388], ["epizootic", 0.10261211765609209], ["dying", 0.09879693500967716], ["dr", 0.09879693500967716], ["age", 0.09543170541949476], ["address", 0.09242140497212831], ["country", 0.09242140497212831], ["children", 0.08969825697771902], ["dollar", 0.08721221763515817], ["sir", 0.08721221763515817], ["illustration", 0.0849252831302], ["credit", 0.08083668759760933], ["window", 0.07899272985082158], ["dear", 0.07726059779892344], ["understand", 0.0756275002606392], ["months", 0.07408272251005989], ["times", 0.07408272251005989], ["living", 0.07122319512271753], ["bad", 0.07122319512271753], ["men", 0.06103248243875375], ["going", 0.06057128300230458], ["god", 0.05830933444434447]], "sentiment": ["Bad times had come\u2014about four months in advance of the epizootic.\n\u201cThe one-way men\u2014designed for up only,\u201d said Breed.\n\u201cAnd their one-way wives and their one-way children,\u201d said Dr. Everett. \u201cDear God\u2014\u201d he said, going to a window and looking out over a wintry Hartford, \u201cthe principal industry of this country is now dying for a living.\u201d\n(illustration credit 5)\nHUNDRED-DOLLAR KISSES\nQ: Do you understand that everything you say is going to be taken down by that stenographer over there?\nA: Yes sir.\nQ: And that anything you say may be used against you?\nA: Understood.\nQ: Your name, age, and address?", -0.4277777777777777], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["christened", 0.20797274149251277], ["dizygotic", 0.10398637074625638], ["footsie", 0.10398637074625638], ["apiece", 0.10398637074625638], ["ashamed", 0.10398637074625638], ["supernumerary", 0.10398637074625638], ["toes", 0.09039524955880647], ["nipples", 0.08244495332139148], ["surrounded", 0.08244495332139148], ["hope", 0.08244495332139148], ["born", 0.07680412837135657], ["friends", 0.07680412837135657], ["parents", 0.07330657661074234], ["fingers", 0.07242876462009755], ["female", 0.07242876462009755], ["expected", 0.07242876462009755], ["ugly", 0.06885383213394158], ["writing", 0.06885383213394158], ["mellon", 0.06885383213394158], ["church", 0.0658312697843875], ["2", 0.0658312697843875], ["monsters", 0.0658312697843875], ["rockefeller", 0.0658312697843875], ["named", 0.06321300718390667], ["city", 0.06321300718390667], ["live", 0.06321300718390667], ["twin", 0.05883764343264764], ["slaves", 0.05883764343264764], ["swain", 0.05782994163019532], ["hand", 0.05696881637766088], ["5", 0.055262710946491676], ["chipmunk", 0.05369324609014782], ["zappa", 0.05369324609014782], ["hospital", 0.05224014859693758], ["vera", 0.04731241470907669], ["york", 0.04337769519021098], ["wilbur", 0.04250609200254757], ["daffodil", 0.04167158975904176], ["thing", 0.04087115849393872], ["ho", 0.04026034466835375], ["long", 0.03665328830537117], ["relatives", 0.03603076480900685], ["day", 0.03427366365822867], ["will", 0.03165540105774783], ["eliza", 0.0306476992552955], ["time", 0.02125092554672488]], "sentiment": ["\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThey hope to become slaves of Vera Chipmunk-5 Zappa some day.

human,\" said Sylvia. She looked from face to face for some flicker of understanding. There was none. The last face into which she peered was Norman Mushari's. Mushari gave her a hideously inappropriate smile of greed and fornication.\nSylvia excused herself abruptly, went into the bathroom and wept.\nThunder was heard in Rosewater now, caused a brindle dog to come scrambling out of the firehouse with psychosomatic rabies. The dog stopped in the middle of the street, shivering. The street lights were faint and far apart. The only other illumination came from a blue bulb in front of the police station in the courthouse basement, a red bulb in front of the firehouse, and a white bulb in the telephone booth across the street from the Saw City Kandy Kitchen, which was the bus depot, too.\nThere was a crash. Lightning turned everything to blue-white diamonds.\nThe dog ran to the door of the Rosewater Foundation, scratched and howled. Upstairs, Eliot slept on. His sickly translucent drip-dry shirt, which hung from a ceiling fixture, swayed like a ghost.\nEliot had only one shirt. He had only one suit\u2014a frowzy, blue, double-breasted chalkstripe now hanging on the knob of the lavatory door. It was a wonderfully made suit, for it still held together, though it was very old. Eliot had gotten it in trade from a volunteer fireman in New Egypt, New Jersey, way back in 1952.\nEliot had only one pair of shoes, black ones. They had a crackle finish as a result of an experiment. Eliot once tried to polish them with Johnson's Glo-Coat, which was a floorwax, not intended for shoes. One shoe was on his desk. The other was in the lavatory, on the rim of the washbasin. A maroon nylon sock, with garter attached, was in each shoe. One end of the garter of the sock in the shoe on the washbasin was in the water. It had saturated itself and its sock, too, through the magic of capillary action.", -0.014166994621540077], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["song",

strikers and an employer in the history of American labor. It happened in Cleveland, in front of the main gate of Cuyahoga Bridge and Iron, on Christmas morning in Eighteen-hundred and Ninety-four. That was long before I was born. My parents were still children in the Russian Empire when it happened. But the man who sent me to Harvard, Alexander Hamilton McCone, watched it from the factory clock tower in the company of his father and his older brother John. That was when he ceased to be a slight stammerer and became, when the least bit anxious about anything, a bubbling booby of totally blocked language instead.\nCuyahoga Bridge and Iron, incidentally, lost its identity, save in labor history, long ago. It was absorbed by Youngstown Steel shortly after the Second World War, and Youngstown Steel itself has now become a mere division of The RAMJAC Corporation.\nPeace.\nYes, and I lifted my old hands from the folded bedding, and I clapped three times. Here was what that was all about, as silly as it was: Those three claps completed a rowdy song I had never liked, and which I had not thought about for thirty years or more. I was making my mind as blank as possible, you see, since the past was so embarrassing and the future so terrifying. I had made so many enemies over the years that I doubted that I could even get a job as a bartender somewhere. I would simply get dirtier and raggedier, I thought, since I would have no money coming in from anywhere. I would wind up on Skid Row and learn to keep the cold out by drinking wine, I thought, although I had never liked alcohol.\nThe worst thing, I thought, was that I would be asleep in an alley in the Bowery, say, and juvenile delinquents who loathed dirty old men would come along with a can of gasoline. They would soak me in it, and they would touch me off. And the worst thing about that, I thought, would be having my eyeballs lapped by flames.\nNo wonder I craved an empty mind!\nBut I could achieve mental vacancy only intermittently. Most of the time, as I sat there on the cot, I settled for an only slightly less perfect peace, which was filled with thoughts that need not scare me\u2014about Sacco and Vanzetti, as I say, and about the Cuyahoga Massacre, about playing chess with old Alexander Hamilton McCone, and on and on.\nPerfect blankness, when I achieved it, lasted only ten seconds or so\u2014and then it would be wrecked by the song, sung loudly and clearly in my head by an alien voice, which required for its completion that I clap three times. The words were highly offensive to me when I first heard them, which was at a drunken stag party at Harvard during my freshman year. It was a song to be kept secret from women. It may be that no woman has ever heard it, even at this late date. The intent of the lyricist, obviously, was to so coarsen the feelings of males who sang the song that the singers could never believe again what most of us believed with all our hearts back then: that women were more spiritual, more sacred than men.\nI still believe that about women. Is that, too, comical? I have loved only four women in my life\u2014my mother, my late wife, a woman to whom I was once affianced, and one other. I will describe them all by and by. Let it be said now, though, that all four seemed more virtuous, braver about life, and closer to the secrets of the universe than I could ever be.\nBe that as it may, I will now set down the words to the frightful song. And even though I have been technically responsible, because of my high position in a corporate structure in recent years, for the publication of some of the most scurrilous books about women ever written, I still find myself shrinking from setting on paper, where they have perhaps never been before, the words to the song. The tune to which they were sung, incidentally, was an old one, a tune that I call \u201cRuben, Ruben.\u201d It no doubt has many other names.", 0.011890628397477713], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["talked", 0.3255538004606936], ["whore", 0.08891186647381344], ["control", 0.06376439909203062], ["bar", 0.05850702039482417], ["hotel", 0.05008520007087594], ["interested", 0.047676595698575026], ["serving", 0.04445593323690672], ["pope", 0.04445593323690672], ["apathies", 0.04445593323690672], ["pigalle", 0.04445593323690672], ["bastards", 0.04445593323690672], ["jews", 0.04445593323690672], ["measure", 0.04445593323690672], ["passions", 0.04445593323690672], ["migrations", 0.04445593323690672], ["perversions", 0.04445593323690672], ["simplifying", 0.04445593323690672], ["overestimated", 0.04445593323690672], ["phonies", 0.04445593323690672], ["lemmings", 0.04445593323690672], ["delights", 0.04445593323690672], ["hangout", 0.04445593323690672], ["unobtainable", 0.04445593323690672], ["supervised", 0.04445593323690672], ["tides", 0.04445593323690672], ["whores", 0.04445593323690672], ["night", 0.04134120338438496], ["ilium", 0.04061432814008976], ["religious", 0.039040720888782146], ["guarded", 0.039040720888782146], ["birth", 0.039040720888782146], ["prado", 0.039040720888782146], ["gangsters", 0.039040720888782146], ["tormentor", 0.039040720888782146], ["missing", 0.039040720888782146], ["del", 0.039040720888782146], ["entry", 0.039040720888782146], ["heavily", 0.03587302473168712], ["birds", 0.03587302473168712], ["appointment", 0.03587302473168712], ["pick", 0.03587302473168712], ["hitler", 0.03587302473168712], ["10", 0.03587302473168712], ["mortal", 0.03587302473168712], ["volcanoes", 0.03587302473168712], ["bright", 0.03362550854065758], ["rich", 0.03362550854065758], ["port", 0.03362550854065758], ["drunk", 0.03362550854065758], ["breed", 0.032491274088747434], ["early", 0.03188219954601531], ["force", 0.03188219954601531], ["nature", 0.03188219954601531], ["bug", 0.03188219954601531], ["bartender", 0.03188219954601531], ["middle", 0.03188219954601531], ["wasn", 0.030887302931558634], ["charge", 0.03045781238356254], ["offered", 0.03045781238356254], ["agent", 0.03045781238356254], ["happen", 0.029253510197412087], ["ready", 0.029253510197412087], ["9", 0.029253510197412087], ["sandra", 0.029253510197412087], ["things", 0.028424350678377647], ["morning", 0.028210296192533003], ["business", 0.028210296192533003], ["asa", 0.028210296192533003], ["cod", 0.028210296192533003], ["electric", 0.028210296192533003], ["kill", 0.027290116226467508], ["forge", 0.027290116226467508], ["cape", 0.027290116226467508], ["truth", 0.027290116226467508], ["foundry", 0.027290116226467508], ["secret", 0.02646698719789074], ["child", 0.02646698719789074], ["meant", 0.025722376418169452], ["school", 0.025722376418169452], ["poor", 0.025722376418169452], ["hoenikker", 0.024175386373945746], ["chair", 0.023838297849287513], ["place", 0.023299291040795703], ["high", 0.023299291040795703], ["happened", 0.021874903878342934], ["company", 0.021874903878342934], ["laboratory", 0.021452503712168905], ["franklin", 0.021452503712168905], ["room", 0.021051774849766166], ["understand", 0.02067060169219248], ["nice", 0.02030716407004488], ["felix", 0.01995988467496024], ["turned", 0.01995988467496024], ["people", 0.019495440591152248], ["lot", 0.019308465855123903], ["son", 0.019002054033613894], ["work", 0.0187072077212479], ["general", 0.017884078692671133], ["man", 0.017113118815460474], ["life", 0.01437665509854689], ["dr", 0.01358684168548932], ["bokonon", 0.011044479182093789], ["frank", 0.009129459978711094]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIf I actually supervised Felix,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I\u2019m ready now to take charge of volcanoes, the tides, and the migrations of birds and lemmings.

He would pick me up at my hotel on his way to work, he said, thus simplifying my entry into the heavily-guarded Research Laboratory.\nSo I had a night to kill in Ilium.

I said I wasn\u2019t interested, and she was bright enough to say that she wasn\u2019t really interested either. As things turned out, we had both overestimated our apathies, but not by much.\nBefore we took the measure of each other\u2019s passions, however, we talked about Frank Hoenikker, and we talked about the old man, and we talked a little about Asa Breed, and we talked about the General Forge and Foundry Company, and we talked about the Pope and birth control, about Hitler and the Jews.

She was already dressed for the party at the Country Club, already dominating a distinguished company she had yet to join.\nAs she handed Paul his cocktail, he felt somehow inadequate, bumbling, in the presence of her beautiful assurance. Only things that might please or interest her came to mind\u2014all else submerged. It wasn\u2019t a conscious act of his mind, but a reflex, a natural response to her presence. It annoyed him that the feeling should be automatic, because he fancied himself in the image of his father, and, in this situation, his father would have been completely in charge\u2014taking the first, last, and best lines for himself.\nThe expression \u201carmed to the teeth\u201d occurred to Paul as he looked at her over his glass.

Inadvertently, he\u2019d gained the upper hand. He had somehow communicated the thought that had bobbed up in his thoughts unexpectedly: that her strength and poise were no more than a mirror image of his own importance, an image of the power and self-satisfaction the manager of the Ilium Works could have, if he wanted it. In a fleeting second she became a helpless, bluffing little girl in his thoughts, and he was able to feel real tenderness toward her.\n\u201cGood drink, sweetheart,\u201d he said. \u201cFinnerty upstairs?\u201d\n\u201cI sent him on over to the club.

While his memory worked like a mousetrap, paralysis still gripped him whenever he thought of mentioning love to the serene brunette.\nAlfred sighed and picked up a sheaf of invoices. The first was addressed to the Davenport Spot-welding Company. He closed his eyes and a shimmering tableau appeared. He had composed it two days previous, when Mr. Thriller had given him special instructions. Two davenports faced each other. Lana Turner, sheathed in a tight-fitting leopard skin, lay on one. On the other was Jane Russell, in a sarong made of telegrams. Both of them blew kisses to Alfred, who contemplated them for a moment, then reluctantly let them fade.\nHe scribbled a note to Ellen: Please make sure Davenport Spot-welding Company and Davenport Wire and Cable Company have not been confused in our billing. Six weeks before, the matter would certainly have slipped his mind. I love you, he added, and then carefully crossed it out with a long black rectangle of ink.\nIn one way, his good memory was a curse. By freeing him from hours of searching through filing cabinets, it gave him that much more time to worry about Ellen. The richest moments in his life were and had been\u2014even before the Memory Clinic\u2014his daydreams. The most delicious of these featured Ellen. Were he to give her the opportunity to turn him down, and she almost certainly would, she could never appear in his fantasies again.
