helicopter aloft is a roller coaster or a Ferris wheel.\nYes, and when martial law was established in New York City, the former Museum of the American Indian was turned into a barracks, and Kilgore Trout was relieved of his bazooka, and the Academy\u2019s headquarters were requisitioned as an officers\u2019 club, and he and Monica Pepper and Dudley Prince and Jerry Rivers took off in the limousine for Xanadu.\nTrout, the former hobo, had expensive clothing, including shoes and socks and underwear and cuff links, and matched Louis Vuitton luggage which had belonged to Zoltan Pepper. Everybody agreed that Monica\u2019s husband was better off dead. What would he have had to look forward to?\nWhen Trout found Zoltan\u2019s flattened and elongated wheelchair in the middle of West 155th Street, he leaned it against a tree and said it was modern art. The two wheels had been squashed together so they looked like one. Trout said it was a six-foot aluminum-and-leather praying mantis, trying to ride a unicycle.\nHe called it The Spirit of the Twenty-first Century.\n55\nI met the author Dick Francis at the Kentucky Derby years ago. I knew he had been a champion rider in steeplechases. I said he was a bigger man than I had expected. He replied that it took a big man to \u201chold a horse together\u201d in a steeplechase. This image of his remained in the forefront of my memory so long, I think, because life itself can seem a lot like that: a matter of holding one\u2019s self-respect together, instead of a horse, as one\u2019s self-respect is expected to hurdle fences and hedges and water.\nMy dear thirteen-year-old daughter Lily, having become a pretty adolescent, appears to me, as do most American adolescents, to be holding her self-respect together the best she can in a really scary steeplechase.\nI said to the new graduates at Butler University, not much older than Lily, that they were being called Generation X, two clicks from the end, but that they were as much Generation A as Adam and Eve had been. What malarkey!\nEsprit de l\u2019escalier! Better late than never! Only at this very moment in 1996, as I am about to write the next sentence, have I realized how meaningless the image of a Garden of Eden must have been to my young audience, since the world was so densely populated with other secretly frightened people, and so overplanted and rigged with both natural and manmade booby traps.", 0.03036042240587695], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["ying", 0.10318636307145083], ["pi", 0.10318636307145083], ["kelly", 0.09891335850746612], ["news", 0.06882957364905855], ["average", 0.06514994730192068], ["lives", 0.06054703414269218], ["pilot", 0.06054703414269218], ["states", 0.055451774444795626], ["kill", 0.05277890909018497], ["sergeant", 0.05277890909018497], ["united", 0.05277890909018497], ["voice", 0.049367248459866654], ["snap", 0.046909049404784776], ["rotten", 0.046909049404784776], ["dejection", 0.046909049404784776], ["trumps", 0.046909049404784776], ["reassure", 0.046909049404784776], ["wrath", 0.046909049404784776], ["brusqueness", 0.046909049404784776], ["outlaw", 0.046909049404784776], ["explosively", 0.046909049404784776], ["wryly", 0.046909049404784776], ["shrugged", 0.04510573980599479], ["game", 0.04510573980599479], ["bad", 0.04231608561167834], ["waking", 0.041363871960305214], ["entertainment", 0.041363871960305214], ["considers", 0.041363871960305214], ["irrelevantly", 0.041363871960305214], ["suspense", 0.041363871960305214], ["provide", 0.041363871960305214], ["youngster", 0.038120151095439904], ["courage", 0.038120151095439904], ["threatening", 0.038120151095439904], ["stroked", 0.038120151095439904], ["play", 0.037873977826105874], ["transport", 0.03581869451582566], ["bargain", 0.03581869451582566], ["shooting", 0.03581869451582566], ["boom", 0.03403354610531198], ["borrowed", 0.03403354610531198], ["smarter", 0.03403354610531198], ["dare", 0.03403354610531198], ["fist", 0.03403354610531198], ["loudly", 0.03403354610531198], ["prisoners", 0.03403354610531198], ["carry", 0.03403354610531198], ["dug", 0.03403354610531198], ["nuts", 0.03403354610531198], ["prove", 0.03257497365096034], ["pockets", 0.03257497365096034], ["chess", 0.03257497365096034], ["curiosity", 0.03257497365096034], ["limp", 0.03134176821234227], ["worst", 0.03027351707134609], ["shoot", 0.03027351707134609], ["better", 0.02970076784585002], ["bear", 0.02933125278609502], ["shoulder", 0.02933125278609502], ["lose", 0.02933125278609502], ["army", 0.02933125278609502], ["paused", 0.02933125278609502], ["sore", 0.02848836866083241], ["going", 0.02769842338285831], ["upstairs", 0.027029796206480775], ["wide", 0.027029796206480775], ["margaret", 0.027029796206480775], ["expression", 0.026389454545092485], ["wife", 0.026072394736013405], ["fingers", 0.02579659076786271], ["children", 0.025244647795967096], ["colonel", 0.02472833962686653], ["supposed", 0.02472833962686653], ["shut", 0.02378607534161546], ["corporal", 0.023353537571453253], ["cold", 0.02294319121635285], ["chance", 0.02182509567735158], ["bring", 0.021484618762001213], ["closed", 0.021484618762001213], ["smiled", 0.021484618762001213], ["war", 0.019699470351487534], ["wouldn", 0.017808360126973694], ["hands", 0.017200472871150313], ["sir", 0.01700769245851783], ["stood", 0.016279918232872018], ["hand", 0.01593944131752165], ["face", 0.01593944131752165], ["young", 0.01545444434299017], ["asked", 0.013763971593652516], ["thought", 0.012807610388454254], ["wasn", 0.012585373875597647], ["eyes", 0.011753456167405267], ["will", 0.011753456167405267], ["thing", 0.010910572042142656], ["looked", 0.009753922211653797], ["man", 0.00888032787593386], ["good", 0.008811657926402728]], "sentiment": ["\"Shut up.\" The sergeant paused. \"What about it, sir\u2014 good news or bad?\"\nKelly stroked his wife\u2019s shoulder, trying to make the right words come\u2014words to carry courage he wasn\u2019t sure he had. \"Bad news,\" he said at last. \"Rotten news.\"\n\"Well, let\u2019s have it,\" said the transport pilot loudly.

And, as they were leaving the packaging department, young Chrono picked up one of the four-inch pieces and slipped it into his pocket. The piece he picked up differed from all the rest in having two holes drilled in it.\nThis was Chrono\u2019s good-luck piece. It became as much a part of him as his right hand. His nervous system, so to speak, extended itself into the metal strap. Touch it and you touched Chrono.\nUnk, the deserter, stood up behind his turquoise boulder, walked vigorously and officiously into the school yard. He had stripped his uniform of all insignia. This gave him a rather official, warlike look, without binding him to any particular enterprise. Of all the equipment he had been carrying before he deserted, he retained only a jungle knife, his single-shot Mauser, and one grenade. These three weapons he left cached behind the boulder, along with the stolen bicycle.\nUnk marched up to Miss Fenstermaker. He told her that he wished to interview young Chrono on official business at once\u2014privately. He did not tell her that he was the boy\u2019s father. Being the boy\u2019s father entitled him to nothing. Being an official investigator entitled him to anything he might care to ask for.\nPoor Miss Fenstermaker was easily fooled. She agreed to let Unk interview the boy in her own office.\nHer office was crammed with ungraded school papers, some of them dating back five years. She was far behind in her work\u2014so far behind that she had declared a moratorium on school work until she could catch up on her grading. Some of the stacks of papers had tumbled, forming glaciers that sent fingers under her desk, into the hallway, and into her private lavatory.\nThere was an open, two-drawer filing cabinet filled with her rock collection.\nNobody ever checked up on Miss Fenstermaker.

And I wonder now if that isn\u2019t a secret ingredient in the attitudes of so many people here, citizens or not: that this is still a virgin continent, and that everybody else is an Indian who does not appreciate its value, or is at least too weak and ignorant to defend himself?\nThe darkest secret of this country, I am afraid, is that too many of its citizens imagine that they belong to a much higher civilization somewhere else. That higher civilization doesn\u2019t have to be another country. It can be the past instead\u2014the United States as it was before it was spoiled by immigrants and the enfranchisement of the blacks.\nThis state of mind allows too many of us to He and cheat and steal from the rest of us, to sell us junk and addictive poisons and corrupting entertainments. What are the rest of us, after all, but sub-human aborigines?\nThis state of mind explains a lot of American funeral customs, too. The message of so many obsequies here, if you think about it, is this: that the dead person has looted this alien continent, and is now returning to his or her real home with the gold of El Dorado.\nBut back to 1936 again!

There was warm, rubbery stuff over rods of some kind.\nBut then we heard the big front door open and close downstairs. As Terry Kitchen once said of a postcoital experience of his own: \u201cThe epiphany came back, and everybody had to put on their clothes and run around again like chickens with their heads cut off.\u201d\nAs Marilee and I were dressing, I whispered to her that I loved her with all my heart.

Clarke\u2019s Childhood\u2019s End, which I thought was a masterpiece. He was best known for the movie 2001, the very year in which I am writing and coughing now.\nI saw 2001 twice in Vietnam. I remember 2 wounded soldiers in wheelchairs in the front row at 1 of those showings. The whole front row was wheelchairs. The 2 soldiers had had their feet wrecked some way, but seemed to be OK from the knees on up, and they weren\u2019t in any pain. They were awaiting transportation back to the States, I guess, where they could be fitted with prostheses. I don\u2019t think either of them was older than 18. One was black and 1 was white.\nAfter the lights went up, I heard the black one say to the white one, \u201cYou tell me: What was that all about?\u201d\nThe white one said, \u201cI dunno, I dunno. I\u2019ll be happy if I can just get back to Cairo, Illinois.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t pronounce it \u201cky-roe.\u201d He pronounced it \u201ckayroe.\u201d\nMy mother-in-law from Peru, Indiana, pronounces the name of her hometown \u201cpee-roo,\u201d not \u201cpuh-roo.\u201d", 0.14927848307291666], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["durant", 0.15824627592178278], ["lilacs", 0.14428504733410766], ["children", 0.12767643846962357], ["flowers", 0.12717030213509664], ["parade", 0.09623788315990238], ["england", 0.07214252366705383], ["float", 0.07214252366705383], ["churches", 0.07214252366705383], ["badge", 0.07214252366705383], ["bugler", 0.07214252366705383], ["taps", 0.07214252366705383], ["leisure", 0.07214252366705383], ["austere", 0.07214252366705383], ["splendidly", 0.07214252366705383], ["teachers", 0.07214252366705383], ["annie", 0.0668654370642521], ["lifted", 0.06358515106754832], ["oblivious", 0.06358515106754832], ["cloud", 0.06358515106754832], ["badly", 0.06358515106754832], ["halted", 0.06358515106754832], ["bullets", 0.06358515106754832], ["statue", 0.06358515106754832], ["smoking", 0.06358515106754832], ["handcuffs", 0.06358515106754832], ["backfiring", 0.06358515106754832], ["bearing", 0.058579408992138884], ["rode", 0.058579408992138884], ["authority", 0.058579408992138884], ["curb", 0.058579408992138884], ["swept", 0.055027778468042826], ["motorcycle", 0.055027778468042826], ["purple", 0.055027778468042826], ["leather", 0.055027778468042826], ["plaque", 0.055027778468042826], ["knees", 0.05227291980984271], ["orders", 0.05227291980984271], ["teacher", 0.05002203639263339], ["pistol", 0.05002203639263339], ["policeman", 0.05002203639263339], ["pefko", 0.05002203639263339], ["dozen", 0.04811894157995119], ["whistle", 0.04811894157995119], ["cry", 0.04811894157995119], ["stepped", 0.04811894157995119], ["lovely", 0.04811894157995119], ["memorial", 0.04811894157995119], ["fat", 0.04647040586853733], ["played", 0.045016294317223954], ["slowly", 0.045016294317223954], ["whispered", 0.045016294317223954], ["beneath", 0.045016294317223954], ["carried", 0.04371554721033721], ["arms", 0.04146466379312789], ["filled", 0.04146466379312789], ["large", 0.04146466379312789], ["blew", 0.03870980513492777], ["touch", 0.03870980513492777], ["laid", 0.03791303326903183], ["club", 0.037164581147841276], ["feet", 0.03515817461083171], ["street", 0.03515817461083171], ["george", 0.03240331595263159], ["square", 0.031453179642309016], ["town", 0.027234052559320668], ["high", 0.02629595494230928], ["year", 0.02542413312485307], ["called", 0.02542413312485307], ["band", 0.024349918594116896], ["eyes", 0.021190247308472448], ["time", 0.012732840267394348]], "sentiment": ["Before them rode the town policeman, fat with leisure, authority, leather, bullets, pistol, handcuffs, club, and a badge.

under the floorboards, and the secret drawer in the desk remained a secret.\nThe American garrison in Beda was about a hundred men, almost all of them, save Captain Donnini, veterans of years of fighting in the same armored division from which Major Evans had come. They behaved like conquerors, with Major Evans encouraging them to do just that. I\u2019d expected a great deal of the coming of the Americans\u2014a rebirth of pride and dignity for Marta and me; a little prosperity and good things to eat, too; and for Marta, the better part of a lifetime worth living. Instead, there was the bullying distrust of Major Evans, the new commandant, multiplied a hundred times in the persons of his men.\nIn the nightmare of a warring world, it takes peculiar skills to get along. One of these is the understanding of the psychology of occupation troops. The Russians weren\u2019t like the Nazis, and the Americans were very different from either. There wasn\u2019t the physical violence of the Russians and Nazis, thank God\u2014no shootings or torture. What was particularly interesting was that the Americans had to get drunk before they could make real trouble. Unfortunately for Beda, Major Evans let them get drunk as often as they liked. When they were drunk, they were fond of stealing\u2014in the name of souvenir hunting\u2014driving jeeps through the street at breakneck speeds, firing guns in the air, shouting obscenities, picking fistfights, and breaking windows.\nThe people of Beda were so used to keeping silent and out of sight, no matter what happened, that it took us a while to discover the really basic difference between the Americans and the others. The Americans\u2019 toughness, callousness, was very shallow, and beneath it was grave misgiving. We discovered that they could be embarrassed easily by women or older men who would stand up to them like parents, and scold them for what they were doing. This sobered most of them up as quickly as buckets of cold water would have.\nWith that insight into our conquerors, we were able to make things a little more bearable, but not much. There was the crushing realization that we were regarded as the enemy, little different from the Russians, and that the major wanted us punished. The townspeople were organized into labor battalions, and put to work under armed guard, like prisoners of war. What made the labor particularly deadly is that it wasn\u2019t concerned with repairing the war damage to the town so much as with making the American garrison\u2019s quarters more comfortable, and with building a huge and ugly monument honoring the Americans who had died in the battle for Beda. Four had died. Major Evans made the atmosphere of the town the atmosphere of a prison. Shame was the order of the day, and budding pride or hope was promptly nipped. We weren\u2019t entitled to them.\nThere was one bright spot\u2014an American unhappier than any of us\u2014Captain Donnini. It was up to him to carry out the major\u2019s orders, and getting drunk, which he tried several times, didn\u2019t do for him what it did for the others. He carried out the orders with a reluctance I\u2019m sure he could have been court-martialed for. Moreover, he spent as much time with Marta and me as he did with the major, and most of his talk with us was a guarded apology for what he had to do. Curiously, Marta and I found ourselves comforting this sad, dark giant, rather than the other way around.\nI thought about the major as I stood at my workbench in the back room, finishing up the American eagle for the front of the new commandant\u2019s desk. Marta lay on my cot, staring at the ceiling. Her shoes were white with rock dust. She had been working all day on the monument.\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said gloomily, \u201cif I\u2019d been fighting for three years, I wonder how friendly I would be. Let\u2019s face it, whether all of us wanted to or not, we gave men and materials that helped to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans.\u201d I gestured at the mountains to the west. \u201cLook where the Russians got their uranium.\u201d\n\u201cEye for eye, tooth for tooth,\u201d said Marta. \u201cHow long does that go on?\u201d\nI sighed and shook my head. \u201cThe Czechs have paid with interest, God knows. Hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\u201d We\u2019d lost most of our young men, Marta\u2019s husband among them, in suicide waves before main Russian attacks; and our largest cities were little more than gravel and smoke.", 0.06544667453758364], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
