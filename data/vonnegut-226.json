Salo didn\u2019t think he could stand that, because he loved Winston Niles Rumfoord.\nThere was nothing offensive in this love. That is to say, it wasn\u2019t homosexual. It couldn\u2019t be, since Salo had no sex.\nHe was a machine, like all Tralfamadorians.\nHe was held together by cotter pins, hose clamps, nuts, bolts, and magnets. Salo\u2019s tangerine-colored skin, which was so expressive when he was emotionally disturbed, could be put on or taken off like an Earthling wind-breaker. A magnetic zipper held it shut.\nThe Tralfamadorians, according to Salo, manufactured each other. No one knew for certain how the first machine had come into being.\nThe legend was this:\nOnce upon a time on Tralfamadore there were creatures who weren\u2019t anything like machines. They weren\u2019t dependable. They weren\u2019t efficient. They weren\u2019t predictable. They weren\u2019t durable. And these poor creatures were obsessed by the idea that everything that existed had to have a purpose, and that some purposes were higher than others.\nThese creatures spent most of their time trying to find out what their purpose was. And every time they found out what seemed to be a purpose of themselves, the purpose seemed so low that the creatures were filled with disgust and shame.\nAnd, rather than serve such a low purpose, the creatures would make a machine to serve it. This left the creatures free to serve higher purposes. But whenever they found a higher purpose, the purpose still wasn\u2019t high enough.\nSo machines were made to serve higher purposes, too.", 0.16151098901098898], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["kill", 0.19960770725644805], ["croaked", 0.16258169869497313], ["sophisticated", 0.16258169869497313], ["bokonon", 0.16156495260662915], ["crooked", 0.14277749353611754], ["chased", 0.14277749353611754], ["joy", 0.14277749353611754], ["attempted", 0.14277749353611754], ["yessir", 0.14277749353611754], ["luck", 0.14277749353611754], ["message", 0.1311927761615986], ["closer", 0.1311927761615986], ["leaned", 0.122973288377262], ["managed", 0.11659775833971313], ["reply", 0.111388571002743], ["will", 0.10763982654592802], ["remembered", 0.09980385362822403], ["matter", 0.09980385362822403], ["caught", 0.09679355318085756], ["smile", 0.09679355318085756], ["papa", 0.0931380825015795], ["agreed", 0.08929743133892924], ["sir", 0.08336487805955083], ["hear", 0.08163274600765269], ["order", 0.07559534333144678], ["lorenzo", 0.04466357340797054], ["san", 0.04160722713505145], ["good", 0.04039123815165729], ["people", 0.03564880565239268]], "sentiment": ["\u201cSan Lorenzo,\u201d he agreed.

How could I possibly argue with the sacred word of honor of Gloria Hilton?\"\nI knew what he looked like. He was the one who\u2019d done all the negotiating for the bathtub enclosure. I had also sold him two Fleetwood Trip-L-Trak storm windows for the two bathroom windows. Those have the self-storing screen feature. The whole time we were negotiating, he called his wife \"Miss Hilton.\" Miss Hilton wanted this, and Miss Hilton wanted that. He was only thirty-five, but the circles under his eyes made him look sixty.\n\"I pity you,\" Gloria Hilton said to him. \"I pity anybody who can\u2019t love. They are the most pitiful people there are.\"\n\"The more you talk,\" he said, \"the more I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m one of them.\"\nHe was the writer, of course. My wife keeps a lot of Hollywood stuff in her head, and she tells me Gloria Hilton was married to a motorcycle policeman, then a sugar millionaire, then somebody who played Tarzan, then her agent\u2014and then the writer.
