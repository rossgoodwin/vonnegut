I was thrilled and proud of what the firm had done, and not being able to show it off, even to him, was depressing.\nIt was too much for me, and I decided to engineer a coincidence. I would find out in which restaurant Herbert worked, and then drop in, like any other citizen, for something to eat. I would happen to have a report on his overhauled portfolio with me.\nI telephoned Alma, who told me the name of the place, one I\u2019d never heard of. Herbert hadn\u2019t wanted to talk about the place, so I gathered that it was pretty grim\u2014as he said, his cross to bear.\nIt was worse than I\u2019d expected: tough, brassy, dark, and noisy. Herbert had picked one hell of a place, indeed, to do penance for a wayward father, or to demonstrate his gratitude to his wife, or to maintain his self-respect by earning his own way\u2014or to do whatever it was he was doing there.\nI elbowed my way between bored-looking women and racetrack types to the bar. I had to shout at the bartender to be heard. When I did get through to him, he yelled back that he\u2019d never heard of no Herbert Foster. Herbert, then, was about as minor an employee as there was in the establishment. He was probably doing something greasy in the kitchen or basement. Typical.\nIn the kitchen, a crone was making questionable-looking hamburgers, and nipping at a quart of beer.\n\"I\u2019m looking for Herbert Foster.\"\n\"Ain\u2019 no damn\u2019 Herbert Foster in here.\"\n\"In the basement?\"\n\"Ain\u2019 no damn\u2019 basement.\"", 0.14820808531746027], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["contribution", 0.05788855119849812],

Come on over. There\u2019s room for everybody in Shangri-La.\u201d\n18\nKATMANDU, my contribution to Western civilization, has been performed three times before paying audiences\u2014once at the Theatre de Lys in New York City in 1960, in the same month that Father died, and then twice on the stage of Fairchild High School in Midland City three years later. The female lead of the Midland City production was, incidentally, none other than Celia Hildreth Hoover, to whom Father had tried to present an apple so long ago.\nIn the first act of the play, which was set in Midland City, Celia, who in real life would eventually swallow Drno, played the ghost of John Fortune\u2019s wife. In the second act, she was a mysterious Oriental woman he meets at the Taj Mahal. She offers to show him the way to Shangri-La, and leads the way over mountains and through jungle on the path to Katmandu. And then, after Fortune speaks his message for the people back in Midland City and dies, she doesn\u2019t say anything, but she reveals herself as the ghost of his wife again.\nIt isn\u2019t an easy part, and Celia had never done any acting at all before. She was only the wife of a Pontiac dealer, but I think she was actually at least as good as the professional actress who did it in New York City. She was certainly more beautiful. She hadn\u2019t yet been made all raddled and addled and snaggletoothed and haggard by amphetamine.\nI forget the name of the actress in New York City now. I think maybe she dropped out of acting after Katmandu.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSpeaking of amphetamine: Father\u2019s old friend Hitler was evidently one of the first people to experience its benefits. I read recently that his personal doctor kept him bright eyed and bushy tailed right up to the end with bigger and bigger doses of vitamins and amphetamine.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI went straight from pharmacy school to a job as all-night man at Schramm\u2019s Drugstore, six days a week from midnight to dawn. I still lived with my parents, but now I was able to make a substantial contribution to their support and my own. It was a dangerous job, since Schramm\u2019s, the only business establishment of any sort that was open all night, was a sort of lighthouse for lunatics and outlaws. My predecessor, old Malcolm Hyatt, who went to high school with my father, was killed by a robber from out of town. The robber swung off the Shepherdstown Turnpike, and closed old Hyatt\u2019s peephole with a sawed-off shotgun, and then swung back onto the Interstate again.", 0.11290365662706088], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["heinz", 0.18407326442220645], ["terrible", 0.16615550969070667], ["motorcycle", 0.12900858812824093], ["typewriter", 0.11854553094114989], ["watch", 0.11077033979380443], ["built", 0.09981182335844867], ["smithereens", 0.07411887747960345], ["excepting", 0.07411887747960345], ["eavesdroppers", 0.07411887747960345], ["negligible", 0.07411887747960345], ["slaves", 0.07411887747960345], ["traded", 0.07411887747960345], ["bicycle", 0.06475202368825284], ["blown", 0.06475202368825284], ["ring", 0.06475202368825284], ["pauper", 0.06475202368825284], ["candle", 0.06475202368825284], ["dormitory", 0.06475202368825284], ["bottle", 0.06475202368825284], ["manned", 0.06475202368825284], ["vale", 0.06475202368825284], ["pillbox", 0.06475202368825284], ["property", 0.06475202368825284], ["slept", 0.059272765470574945], ["wedding", 0.059272765470574945], ["drinking", 0.059272765470574945], ["friendship", 0.059272765470574945], ["amount", 0.059272765470574945], ["market", 0.05538516989690222], ["cigarettes", 0.05538516989690222], ["wasn", 0.054569217045700766], ["estate", 0.05236971650076425], ["defense", 0.05236971650076425], ["armed", 0.05236971650076425], ["tears", 0.05236971650076425], ["awful", 0.05236971650076425], ["weren", 0.049905911679224334], ["furniture", 0.049905911679224334], ["clothes", 0.047822794384261375], ["loved", 0.04601831610555161], ["drunk", 0.04442665346154643], ["talking", 0.04442665346154643], ["sat", 0.04442665346154643], ["russians", 0.04442665346154643], ["close", 0.040539057887873715], ["place", 0.03945739967606916], ["simply", 0.037523604491735744], ["feel", 0.035832210668032966], ["real", 0.035832210668032966], ["person", 0.03297668237523287], ["black", 0.031172204096523104], ["berlin", 0.031172204096523104], ["looked", 0.03062055552192506], ["left", 0.029089086801560148], ["howard", 0.02861487977708353], ["wife", 0.027713644986560933], ["long", 0.027284608522850383], ["love", 0.02607363340542218], ["thing", 0.024611287667040658], ["going", 0.0232918488891499], ["things", 0.02180535030517249], ["told", 0.02098609865900445], ["will", 0.02098609865900445]], "sentiment": ["\u201cI feel the same way about you, Heinz,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnything I have is yours,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnything I have is yours, Heinz,\u201d I said.\nThe amount of property between us was negligible.

A mate had just been brought to him from Earth. She was Montana Wildhack, a motion picture star.\nMontana was under heavy sedation. Tralfamadorians wearing gas masks brought her in, put her on Billy\u2019s yellow lounge chair; withdrew through his airlock. The vast crowd outside was delighted. All attendance records for the zoo were broken. Everybody on the planet wanted to see the Earthlings mate.\nMontana was naked, and so was Billy, of course. He had a tremendous wang, incidentally. You never know who\u2019ll get one.\nNow she fluttered her eyelids. Her lashes were like buggy whips. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d she said.\n\u201cEverything is all right,\u201d said Billy gently. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\nMontana had been unconscious during her trip from Earth. The Tralfamadorians hadn\u2019t talked to her, hadn\u2019t shown themselves to her. The last thing she remembered was sunning herself by a swimming pool in Palm Springs, California. Montana was only twenty years old. Around her neck was a silver chain with a heart-shaped locket hanging from it\u2014between her breasts.\nNow she turned her head to see the myriads of Tralfamadorians outside the dome. They were applauding her by opening and closing their little green hands quickly.\nMontana screamed and screamed.\nAll the little green hands closed tight, because Montana\u2019s terror was so unpleasant to see. The head zoo keeper ordered a crane operator, who was standing by, to drop a navy blue canopy over the dome, thus simulating Earthling night inside. Real night came to the zoo for only one Earthling hour out of every sixty-two.\nBilly switched on a floor lamp. The light from the single source threw the baroque detailing of Montana\u2019s body into sharp relief.

Boaz did what a soldier was supposed to do under such circumstances. Boaz shouted, \"A-tennnn-hut!\" Boaz did this, though he had no rank at all. It is a freak of military custom that the lowliest private can command his equals and noncommissioned superiors to attention, if he is the first to detect the presence of a commissioned officer in any roofed-over structure not in a combat area.\nThe antennas of the enlisted men responded instantly, straightened the men\u2019s backs, locked their joints, hauled in their guts, tucked in their butts-made their minds go blank. Unk sprang up from the floor, stood stiff and shivering.\nOnly one man was slow about coming to attention. That man was Boaz. And when he did come to attention, there was something insolent and loose and leering about the way he did it.\nCaptain Burch, finding Boaz\u2019s attitude profoundly offensive, was about to speak to Boaz about it. But the captain no sooner got his mouth open than pain hit him between the eyes.\nThe captain closed his mouth without having made a sound.\nUnder the baleful gaze of Boaz, he came smartly to attention, did an about-face, heard a snare drum in his head, and marched out of the barrack in step with the drum.\nWhen the captain was gone, Boaz did not put his squadmates at ease again, though it was in his power to do so. He had a small control box in his right front trouser pocket that could make his squadmates do just about anything. The box was the size of a one-pint hip flask.

jazz musicians have been more comforting and enlightening to me than preachers or politicians or philosophers or poets or painters or novelists of my time. Historians in the future, in my opinion, will congratulate us on very little other than our clowning and our jazz.\nAnd if they know what they are doing, they will have especially respectful words for Bob and Ray, whose book this is. They will say, among other things, that Bob and Ray\u2019s jokes were remarkably literary, being fun to read as well as to hear. They may note, too, that Bob and Ray had such energy and such a following that they continued to create marvelous material for radio at a time when radio creatively was otherwise dead.\nI have listened to Bob and Ray for years and years now\u2014in New England, in New York City. We are about the same age, which means that we were inspired by roughly the same saints\u2014-Jack Benny, Fred Allen, W. C. Fields, Stoopnagle and Bud, and on and on. And my collected works would fill Oliver Hardy\u2019s derby, whereas theirs would fill the Astrodome.\nThis book contains about one ten-thousandth of their output, I would imagine. And it might be exciting to say that it represents the cream of the cream of the cream of their jokes. But the truth is that there has been an amazing evenness to their performances. I recall a single broadcast of ten years ago, for example, which might have made a book nearly as elating as this one.\nI was in the studio when I heard it\u2014and saw it, too. I was supposedly applying for a job as a writer for Bob and Ray. We meant to talk about the job in between comedy bits, when the microphones were dead. One of the bits I remember was about selling advertising space on the sides of the Bob and Ray Satellite, which was going to be orbited only twenty-eight feet off the ground.\nThere was an announcement, too, about the Bob and Ray Overstocked Surplus Warehouse, which was crammed with sweaters emblazoned with the letter \u201cO.\u201d If your name didn\u2019t begin with \u201cO,\u201d they said, they could have it legally changed for you.\nAnd so on.\nThere was an episode from Mary Backstayge. Mary\u2019s actor husband, Harry, was trying to get a part in a play.

History tells us this, my dear young Mr. Buntline, if it tells us nothing else: Giving away a fortune is a futile and destructive thing. It makes whiners of the poor, without making them rich or even comfortable. And the donor and his descendents become undistinguished members of the whining poor.\"\n\"A personal fortune as great as yours, Mr. Buntline,\" old McAllister went on, those many fateful years ago, \"is a miracle, thrilling and rare. You have come by it effortlessly, and so have little opportunity to learn what it is. In order to help you learn something about its miraculousness, I have to offer what is perhaps an insult. Here it is, like it or not: Your fortune is the most important single determinant of what you think of yourself and of what others think of you. Because of the money, you are extraordinary. Without it, for example, you would not now be taking the priceless time of a senior partner in McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee.\n\"If you give away your money, you will become utterly ordinary, unless you happen to be a genius. You aren't a genius, are you, Mr. Buntline?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Um. And, genius or not, without money you'll surely be less comfortable and free. Not only that, but you will be volunteering your descendents for the muggy, sorehead way of life peculiar to persons who might have been rich and free, had not a soft-headed ancestor piddled a fortune away.\n\"Cling to your miracle, Mr. Buntline. Money is dehydrated Utopia. This is a dog's life for almost everybody, as your professors have taken such pains to point out. But, because of your miracle, life for you and yours can be a paradise! Let me see you smile! Let me see that you already understand what they do not teach at Harvard until the junior year: That to be born rich and to stay rich is something less than a felony.\"\nLila, Stewart's daughter, now went upstairs to her bedroom. The color scheme, selected by her mother, was pink and frost. Her casement windows looked out on the harbor, on the nodding Pisquontuit Yacht Club fleet.\nA forty-foot workboat named Mary was chugging her graceless, smoky way through the fleet, rocking the playthings. The playthings had names like Scomber and Skat and Rosebud II and Follow Me and Red Dog and Bunty. Rosebud II belonged to Fred and Caroline Rosewater. Bunty belonged to Stewart and Amanita Buntline.\nMary belonged to Harry Pena, the trap fisherman. She was a gray, lapstreak tub whose purpose was to wallow home in all weather with tons of fresh fish on board. There wasn't any shelter on her, except for a wooden box to keep the big new Chrysler dry. The wheel and the throttle and the clutch were mounted on the box.

Thanksgiving Day was a holiday when everybody in the country was expected to express gratitude to the Creator of the Universe, mainly for food.", 0.08941176470588234], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["guards", 0.08145206464915455], ["george", 0.07982395230313145], ["break", 0.060619496087118925], ["trade", 0.0560773404549142], ["sammy", 0.05095580630864853], ["jerry", 0.04887123878949273], ["russians", 0.03609544552887612], ["clothes", 0.035831470746122626], ["prague", 0.035831470746122626], ["shoot", 0.03258082585966182], ["chance", 0.030059429799614255], ["hadn", 0.028982478615384596], ["alvin", 0.0280386702274571], ["skid", 0.0280386702274571], ["row", 0.0280386702274571], ["stained", 0.0280386702274571], ["acting", 0.0280386702274571], ["send", 0.0280386702274571], ["shack", 0.0280386702274571], ["patched", 0.0280386702274571], ["hurting", 0.0280386702274571], ["campaigner", 0.0280386702274571], ["crawled", 0.0280386702274571], ["beefier", 0.0280386702274571], ["chumps", 0.0280386702274571], ["scarecrows", 0.0280386702274571], ["pigeon", 0.0280386702274571], ["begrudged", 0.0280386702274571], ["ripped", 0.0280386702274571], ["drowsy", 0.0280386702274571], ["changes", 0.0280386702274571], ["nerve", 0.0280386702274571], ["impressed", 0.0280386702274571], ["wheedle", 0.0280386702274571], ["resident", 0.0280386702274571], ["overheard", 0.0280386702274571], ["travel", 0.0280386702274571], ["combat", 0.0280386702274571], ["tipped", 0.0280386702274571], ["bluff", 0.0280386702274571], ["command", 0.0280386702274571], ["scaring", 0.0280386702274571], ["damn", 0.02709486183952961], ["pretty", 0.026257483623103373], ["killed", 0.026257483623103373], ["soldier", 0.02474865432791103], ["camp", 0.02474865432791103], ["stool", 0.024122584461581702], ["whispers", 0.024122584461581702], ["smash", 0.024122584461581702], ["benefit", 0.024122584461581702], ["fence", 0.024122584461581702], ["breakthrough", 0.024122584461581702], ["pleading", 0.024122584461581702], ["turning", 0.024122584461581702], ["outfit", 0.024122584461581702], ["healthy", 0.024122584461581702], ["hearing", 0.024122584461581702], ["treat", 0.024122584461581702], ["tempered", 0.024122584461581702], ["sharp", 0.024122584461581702], ["looked", 0.023855874046957517], ["rest", 0.02222725826786346], ["skin", 0.021831821138936707], ["doubt", 0.021831821138936707], ["ugly", 0.021831821138936707], ["fashion", 0.021831821138936707], ["plate", 0.021831821138936707], ["face", 0.0211503070836338], ["friendly", 0.02020649869570631], ["game", 0.02020649869570631], ["mouth", 0.02020649869570631], ["sullivan", 0.02020649869570631], ["fast", 0.02020649869570631], ["tunnel", 0.02020649869570631], ["situation", 0.02020649869570631], ["shooting", 0.02020649869570631], ["entitled", 0.02020649869570631], ["captured", 0.018945800665682525], ["division", 0.018945800665682525], ["trucks", 0.018945800665682525], ["sixty", 0.018945800665682525], ["respect", 0.018945800665682525], ["thick", 0.018945800665682525], ["stories", 0.018945800665682525], ["smokes", 0.018945800665682525], ["hell", 0.018836245923791847], ["sake", 0.017915735373061313], ["week", 0.017915735373061313], ["playing", 0.017915735373061313], ["men", 0.01764573162257347], ["waiting", 0.017044827577427084], ["easy", 0.017044827577427084], ["wild", 0.017044827577427084], ["green", 0.017044827577427084], ["lines", 0.017044827577427084], ["american", 0.016568780438343807], ["york", 0.01629041292983091], ["care", 0.01629041292983091], ["point", 0.01629041292983091], ["brought", 0.01629041292983091], ["word", 0.01629041292983091], ["iron", 0.01629041292983091], ["buddy", 0.015624972050416316], ["worse", 0.015624972050416316], ["quarters", 0.015624972050416316], ["miles", 0.015624972050416316], ["close", 0.015624972050416316], ["months", 0.015624972050416316], ["call", 0.015624972050416316], ["person", 0.015029714899807128], ["remember", 0.015029714899807128], ["business", 0.014491239307692298], ["hour", 0.014491239307692298], ["guy", 0.013999649607185916], ["expect", 0.013999649607185916], ["matter", 0.013999649607185916], ["cigarettes", 0.013999649607185916], ["mind", 0.013547430919764805], ["germans", 0.012738951577162132], ["won", 0.012374327163955515], ["side", 0.012031815176292041], ["days", 0.011403421757590208], ["heard", 0.011403421757590208], ["food", 0.01111362913393173], ["lot", 0.01111362913393173], ["lost", 0.010837978488906691], ["good", 0.010593140559601786], ["hear", 0.0105751535418169], ["front", 0.010324013640286766], ["told", 0.010083563841310518], ["wanted", 0.009852931103907947], ["real", 0.009418122961895923], ["god", 0.008822865811286735], ["big", 0.008284390219171904], ["war", 0.007792800518665521], ["thing", 0.007197543368056333], ["day", 0.007058037082235025], ["man", 0.006659067775941504]], "sentiment": ["Until then, he\u2019d been in command of every situation, whether it was with us or with the Germans. He had a thick skin, and he could bluff or wheedle his way out of anything.\nAlvin York would have been impressed with some of his combat stories. We were all from the same division, except for George. He\u2019d been brought in all by himself, and he said he\u2019d been up front since D-Day. The rest of us were from a green outfit, captured in a breakthrough before we\u2019d been in the line a week. George was a real campaigner, and entitled to a lot of respect. He got it; begrudged, all right, but he got it\u2014until Jerry got killed.\n\u201cCall me a stool pigeon again, buddy, and I\u2019ll smash your ugly face in,\u201d I heard him tell one guy whose whispers he\u2019d overheard. \u201cYou know damn well you\u2019d do the same thing, if you had the chance. I\u2019m just playing the guards for chumps. They think I\u2019m on their side, so they treat me pretty good. I\u2019m not hurting you none, so mind your own damn business!\u201d\nThat was a few days after the break, after Jerry Sullivan got killed. Somebody\u2019d tipped off the guards about the break, or at least it looked that way. They were waiting outside the fence, at the mouth of the tunnel, when Jerry, the first man through, crawled out. They didn\u2019t have to shoot him, but they did. Maybe George hadn\u2019t told the guards\u2014but nobody gave him the benefit of that doubt when he was out of hearing.\nNobody said anything to his face. He was big and healthy, remember, and went on getting beefier and worse-tempered, while the rest of us were turning into drowsy scarecrows.\nBut now, with the Russians on their way, George\u2019s nerve seemed to have given out. \u201cLet\u2019s make a break for Prague, Sammy. Just you and me, so we can travel fast,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat in hell\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d I said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to run from anybody, George. We just won a war, and you\u2019re acting like we lost one. Prague\u2019s sixty miles away, for God\u2019s sake. The Russians\u2019ll be here in an hour or so, and they\u2019ll probably send trucks to run us back to our lines. Take it easy, George\u2014you don\u2019t hear any shooting, do you?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll shoot us, Sammy, sure as hell. You don\u2019t even look like an American soldier. They\u2019re wild men, Sammy. Come on, let\u2019s go while we got the chance.\u201d\nHe had a point about my clothes. They were ripped and stained and patched, and I looked more like a resident of skid row than an American soldier. But, as you might expect, George still looked pretty sharp. The guards kept him in cigarettes as well as food, and he could trade the smokes for just about anything in camp he wanted. He got himself several changes of clothes that way, and the guards let him use an iron they had in their shack, so he was the camp fashion plate.\nHis game was over now. Nobody had to trade with him anymore, and the men who\u2019d taken such good care of him were gone. Maybe that\u2019s what was scaring him, and not the Russians. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Sammy,\u201d he said. He was pleading with me, a person he hadn\u2019t had a friendly word for in eight months at close quarters.", 0.1380952380952381], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
