It is my sorry position to be in need of moral, editorial, and financial help; and Scribner\u2019s feeling, obviously, is that they cannot afford to risk any of these in my case. However much I may sympathize with Scribner\u2019s view (and I do sympathize sincerely), the fact remains that I am stuck with the risk of being me. I am compelled, therefore, to spread the risk around a little, if I can.\nYours truly,\nKurt Vonnegut, Jr.\nApril 15, 1959\nWest Barnstable, MA\nTO CHARLES SCRIBNER\u2019S SONS\nThe novel referred to here as \u201cCat\u2019s Call\u201d eventually became Cat\u2019s Cradle.

depressive descended from monopolar depressives. That\u2019s how come I write so good.\nAre two hemispheres better than one? I know anecdotal evidence isn\u2019t worth a pitcher of warm spit scientifically, but a great-grandfather of mine on my mother\u2019s side switched hemispheres in time to be wounded in the leg as a soldier for the Union in our notoriously uncivil Civil War. His name was Peter Lieber. Peter Lieber bought a brewery in Indianapolis, and it prospered. A brew of his won a Gold Medal at the Paris Exposition of 1889. Its secret ingredient was coffee.\nBut Peter Lieber gave the brewery to his son Albert, my maternal grandfather, and he went back to his original hemisphere. He decided he liked that one better. And I am told there is a photograph often used in our textbooks that supposedly shows immigrants disembarking here, but actually they are getting on a ship to go back to where they came from.\nThis hemisphere is no bed of roses. My mother committed suicide in this one, and then my brother-in-law went off an open drawbridge in a railroad train.\n27\nThe first story Trout had to rewrite after the timequake zapped him back to 1991, he told me, was called \u201cDog\u2019s Breakfast.\u201d It was about a mad scientist named Fleon Sunoco, who was doing research at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Dr. Sunoco believed really smart people had little radio receivers in their heads, and were getting their bright ideas from somewhere else.\n\u201cThe smarties had to be getting outside help,\u201d Trout said to me at Xanadu. While impersonating the mad Sunoco, Trout himself seemed convinced that there was a great big computer somewhere, which, by means of radio, had told Pythagoras about right triangles, and Newton about gravity, and Darwin about evolution, and Pasteur about germs, and Einstein about relativity, and on and on.\n\u201cThat computer, wherever it is, whatever it is, while pretending to help us, may actually be trying to kill us dummies with too much to think about,\u201d said Kilgore Trout.\nTrout said he hadn\u2019t minded writing \u201cDog\u2019s Breakfast\u201d again, or the three hundred or more stories he redid and threw away before free will kicked in again. \u201cWrite or rewrite, it\u2019s all the same to me,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the age of four score and four, I am as amazed and entertained as I was when I was only fourteen, and discovered that if I put the tip of a pen on paper, it would write a story of its own accord.", 0.1663961038961039], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["deeply", 0.3257572875332276], ["honored", 0.2647232714961104], ["fond", 0.2647232714961104], ["catharine", 0.18770691810056092], ["newt", 0.17531005413866038], ["respond", 0.1628786437666138], ["unexpected", 0.1628786437666138], ["remotest", 0.1628786437666138], ["crazy", 0.1593277167802281], ["farther", 0.14362455541772642], ["breath", 0.14362455541772642], ["extremely", 0.14362455541772642], ["protected", 0.12437046706883907], ["speech", 0.11310754739916784], ["wedding", 0.10511637871995169], ["kissed", 0.09627044174443684], ["walking", 0.09385345905028046], ["deep", 0.09385345905028046], ["step", 0.09163005050379334], ["week", 0.08765502706933019], ["late", 0.08586229037106433], ["friend", 0.08259053938060923], ["idea", 0.07830857605207428], ["talking", 0.07237596215490597], ["walked", 0.07031740737285813], ["hands", 0.05972386413593859], ["love", 0.05593009927466773], ["heard", 0.05534528235250573], ["house", 0.05008856014032438], ["thing", 0.03788393070188422]], "sentiment": ["\"Let\u2019s keep walking,\" he said.\n\"No,\" she said. \"So far, no farther.

The Germans weren\u2019t pagans. They were Christians, and the swastika was just one more version of a Christian cross, like the Maltese Cross, the Celtic Cross, the Cross of Lorraine, the Red Cross Cross, Saint Andrew\u2019s Cross. Hitler\u2019s party was the National Socialist Party, and the swastika was a working man\u2019s cross made of tools, of axes. Only kidding, folks.\u201d\nA male kid in the audience there at Northampton shouted this to Berman in the year 2000: \u201cHey Gilbert, who\u2019s gonna win the War on Drugs?\u201d It was a keen and jagged question, for everyone there knew Berman was now a recovering abuser of or experimenter with a veritable smorgasbord of shit, except for booze, by no means all of it illegal. Quite a bit of it had actually been prescribed for him.\nBerman\u2019s reply would make it onto TV and in the papers the next day. There were reporters but not TV cameras there. \u201cThe War on Drugs,\u201d he said, \u201cis one hell of a lot better than no drugs at all.\u201d Irony! His message, missed by the papers and TV, because one had to be in the theater to hear how he said it: He sure missed drugs, and he was now terrified, as he should have been all along, by their puissance and ubiquity.\nThe line wasn\u2019t original with Berman, either, which, again, he would have admitted, if timing had not been of the essence. He had come across it in a book about the \u201cRoaring Twenties,\u201d the Prohibition Era, when thousands upon thousands of heavily armed law-enforcement people, at least half of them half in the bag, were mobilized in order to make people stop drinking alcohol, not even wine or beer. Can you believe it? This really happened! And according to the book, a humorist named Kin Hubbard said in print back then: \u201cProhibition is sure a lot better than no liquor at all.\u201d\nIt was at Columbia that Berman\u2019s life became, among other things, of course, a sequence of mind-bending substances, usually taken in moderation, and on the advice of friends who had tried them. The belief that one could thus fine-tune one\u2019s wits or charm or place in the universe thereby was particularly reputable at Columbia, because several of the psychopharmacological artists calling themselves \u201cBeatniks\u201d had come from there. One, Allen Ginsberg, had written such good poems while a confessed drug-user that he had been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters! As for alcohol, which Berman was still drinking back then, Eugene O\u2019Neill, Sinclair Lewis, Ernest Hemingway, and John Steinbeck, not Columbia grads, to be sure, but American winners of Nobel Prizes for Literature, were all certifiable alcoholics.\nAnd the greatest of all mental-health theorists, Sigmund fucking Freud, was on cocaine.\nThe night that Berman, still an amateur comedian, premiered his routine about the impossibility of teaching evolution or anything else in a New York City ghetto public school, he first swallowed six two-milligram tablets of a patented amphetamine whose trade name was Ritalin, whose street name was speed. The pills had been prescribed by a doctor for his roommate Barry Dresdener, who, still taking them, would go on to become rich beyond the dreams of avarice as a vice president of Microsoft.\nMoments before Berman strode up to the microphone at Cutty Sark, he chased those \u201csix little darlings,\u201d as he called them, with two shots of brandy from the bar.\nThe mistress of ceremonies introduced him, then asked him, on mike, \u201cHow you feelin\u2019 tonight?\u201d\n\u201cBlitzkrieg!\u201d he said.", 0.09725572047000619], "title": "We Are What We Pretend to Be"}, "slaughterhouse-five": {"tfidf": [["englishman", 0.2806483461446308], ["lad", 0.27990482486762963], ["kite", 0.179188565600533], ["exploratorily", 0.179188565600533], ["comment", 0.15443330915196352], ["nodded", 0.15443330915196352], ["pity", 0.15443330915196352], ["joke", 0.15443330915196352], ["touched", 0.13995241243381482], ["private", 0.12967805270339405], ["rank", 0.12170864015645799], ["remember", 0.10969177456284324], ["filled", 0.10492279625482459], ["broken", 0.09354944871487693], ["boots", 0.09354944871487693], ["coat", 0.09044189953667585], ["hear", 0.08493651811427376], ["talk", 0.07045562139612505], ["god", 0.06148010610037839], ["american", 0.05654616544034921], ["asked", 0.04570036494755557], ["man", 0.0394734582638135], ["billy", 0.02197451586884001]], "sentiment": ["When Billy made no comment on this, the Englishman asked him, \u201cCan you talk?

He had never meant for him to actually spend his counterfeit in the marketplace. He had named negotiability simply as his standard for excellence. His bugging eyes and sweaty brow and gasping proved that he was an honest man whose judgment was clouded by jealousy. Because his brilliant apprentice had handed him the ruble, his own work, incidentally, it really did look like a fake to him.\nWhat could the old man do, now? The tobacconist would surely recognize the note as a fake, too, and know where it had come from. After that? The law was the law. The Imperial engraver and his apprentice would be hanged side by side in the marketplace.\n\u201cTo his eternal credit,\u201d Dan Gregory said to me, \u201che himself resolved to retrieve what he thought was a fatal piece of paper. He asked me for the ruble I had copied. I of course handed him my perfect counterfeit.\u201d\nBeskudnikov told the tobacconist a preposterous story about how the ruble his apprentice had spent on cigars had great sentimental value. It was a matter of indifference to the tobacconist, who traded him the real one for the fake.\nThe old man returned to the workshop beaming. The moment he was inside, however, he promised Gregorian the beating of his life. Until that time, Gregorian had always stood still for his beatings, as a good apprentice should.\nThis time the boy ran a short distance away and turned to laugh at his master.\n\u201cHow dare you laugh at a time like this?\u201d cried Beskudnikov.\n\u201cI dare to laugh at you now and for the rest of my life,\u201d the apprentice replied. He told what he had done with his counterfeit ruble and the real one. \u201cYou can teach me no more. I have surpassed you by far,\u201d he said. \u201cI am such a genius that I have tricked the engraver of the Imperial currency into passing a counterfeit ruble in the marketplace. My last words on Earth will be a confession to you, should we find ourselves side by side with nooses around our necks in the marketplace. I will say, \u2018You were right after all.

Good-bye, cruel world, good-bye.\u2019\u201d\n13\nCOCKY DAN GREGORIAN left Beskudnikov\u2019s employ that day, and easily became a journeyman under another master engraver and silk screen artist, who made theatrical posters and illustrations for children\u2019s books.

If somebody asked him if he\u2019d been drunk the night before, he would always answer off-handedly, \u201cOh, I imagine.\u201d I\u2019ve always liked that answer. It acknowledges life as a dream. Cornell was a boozy dream, partly because of booze itself, and partly because I was enrolled exclusively in courses I had no talent for. My father and brother agreed that I should study chemistry, since my brother had done so well with chemicals at M.I.T. He\u2019s eight years older than I am. Funnier, too. His most famous discovery is that silver iodide will sometimes make it rain or snow.\nINTERVIEWER: Was your sister funny, too?\nVONNEGUT: Oh, yes. There was an odd cruel streak to her sense of humor, though, which didn\u2019t fit in with the rest of her character somehow. She thought it was terribly funny whenever anybody fell down. One time she saw a woman come out of a streetcar horizontally, and she laughed for weeks after that.\nINTERVIEWER: Horizontally?\nVONNEGUT: Yes. This woman must have caught her heels somehow. Anyway, the streetcar door opened, and my sister happened to be watching from the sidewalk, and then she saw this woman come out horizontally\u2014as straight as a board, facedown, and about two feet off the ground.\nINTERVIEWER: Slapstick?\nVONNEGUT: Sure. We loved Laurel and Hardy. You know what one of the funniest things is that can happen in a film?\nINTERVIEWER: No.\nVONNEGUT: To have somebody walk through what looks like a shallow little puddle, but which is actually six feet deep. I remember a movie where Cary Grant was loping across lawns at night. He came to a low hedge, which he cleared ever so gracefully, only there was a twenty-foot drop on the other side. But the thing my sister and I loved best was when somebody in a movie would tell everybody off, and then make a grand exit into the coat closet.

six months, and now I\u2019m tired. I need a rest, and I like to eat as well as the next guy. Brighten up, will you!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not, thank you,\u201d I said icily.\nI was sent out on a pick-and-shovel detail; Louis remained in camp as the German sergeant\u2019s orderly. Louis got extra rations for whisk-brooming the sergeant three times a day. I got a hernia while tidying up after the American Air Force.\n\u201cCollaborationist!\u201d I hissed at him after a particularly exhausting day in the streets. He was standing at the prison gate with a guard, immaculate and sprightly, nodding to his acquaintances in the dusty, weary column. His response to my taunt was to walk beside me to the sleeping quarters.\nHe laid a hand on my shoulder. \u201cAnd then you can look at it this way, kid,\u201d he said. \u201cHere you\u2019re helping Jerry clean up his streets so he can run tanks and trucks through \u2019em again. That\u2019s what I\u2019d call collaboration. Me a collaborator? You\u2019ve got it backwards. All I do to help Jerry win the war is smoke his cigarettes and hit him for more to eat. That\u2019s bad, I suppose?\u201d\nI flopped down on my bunk. Louis took a seat on a straw-tick nearby. My arm hung over the side of the bunk, and Louis interested himself in my wrist watch, a gift from my Mother.\n\u201cNice, very nice watch, kid,\u201d he said. And then, \u201cHungry after all that work, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d\nI was ravenous. Ersatz coffee, one bowl of watered soup, and three slices of dry bread are not the sort of fare to delight a pick-swinger\u2019s heart after nine hours of hard labor. Louis was sympathetic. He liked me; he wanted to help. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll make a quick deal for you. There\u2019s no sense in going hungry. Why, that watch is worth two loaves of bread, at least. Is that a good deal, or isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nAt that point, two loaves of bread was a dazzling lure. It was an incredible amount of food for one person to have. I tried to bid him up. \u201cLook, friend,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is a special price to you, and it\u2019s a top price. I\u2019m trying to do you a favor, see? All I ask of you is to keep quiet about this deal, or everybody will want two loaves for a watch. Promise?\u201d\nI swore by all that is holy that I would never reveal the magnanimity of Louis, my best friend. He was back in an hour. He cast a furtive glance around the room, withdrew a long loaf from a rolled field jacket, and stuffed it beneath my mattress. I waited for him to make the second deposit. It was not forthcoming. \u201cI hardly know what to tell you, kid. The guard I do business with told me the whole bottom\u2019s dropped out of the watch market since all these guys came in from the Bulge. Too many watches all at one time is what did it. I\u2019m sorry, but I want you to know that Louis got you the maximum for that watch.\u201d He made a move toward the loaf under the mattress. \u201cIf you feel gypped, all you have to do is say the word, and I\u2019ll take this back and get your watch again.\u201d", 0.1507704219899342], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
