character!\nWhat to do? They did it. They departed the Calvin Theater as quietly as ghosts.\nHoly shit! What a sacred moment.\nIn a few minutes, the silence broken only by the sounds of shuffling footsteps, the opening and closing of doors to the outside, and the clangor of a passing fire engine, there were only four human beings still inside the Calvin. There was Berman onstage. There was Martha Jones, who had subsided back into her seat, as Berman would later say, \u201clike a mountain of apple pan dowdy.\u201d Her Neanderthal features were now a tabula rasa. There was a rosy, roly-poly, uniformed Northampton policeman who had been on duty backstage.\nAnd loping down the aisle from the lobby came Sheldon Hayes, the very tall, very thin, white-haired, sixty-year-old theater manager, who, years ago, had left nearby Florence, Massachusetts, for New York City, in the outsize expectation of becoming a Broadway actor. His long white hair was tied in back with a blue velvet ribbon in a ponytail. He was thrilled and incredulous. Sheldon Hayes believed he had witnessed a theatrical masterpiece.\nSheldon Hayes stopped first before Martha Jones, front row center, and he said, \u201cYou were terrific! I damn near excreted a piece of masonry!\u201d And he wheeled so quickly, in order to look up at Berman, who was now teetering on the apron of the stage, that he could not see that Berman\u2019s stooge, supposedly, might actually be a corpse now.\nAnd Sheldon Hayes called Martha Jones a \u201che.\u201d He said to Gil Berman. \u201cWhere the heck did you find him? He was marvelous! He told me he was part of the show, and had to be front row center, but I couldn\u2019t imagine how you were going to use him. You are a genius. That\u2019s all I can say. How in heck did you know it was going to work that well? And you know what people whispered to me as they were leaving? They were saying things like, \u2018Cool, cool,\u2019 and \u2018Super cool.\u2019 One kid said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to have to go back to the dorm and think about this. No TV tonight.\u2019 They were all so reverent. The Jesus Christ business shocked them, made them so reverent, made them think about all kinds of stuff all at once, which is what the greatest teachers do. But what a crazy risk you took with the Jesus thing. Talk about a chance for a big-time backfire. But you son of a bitch, you got away with it. It worked, it worked. Crazy like a fox. They\u2019re all going to go home and think now.\u201d\nSheldon Hayes wasn\u2019t gay. Like Berman, he was a neuter. Later that evening, Berman would describe him as \u201can albino giraffe.\u201d\nGil Berman for the moment accepted what had happened. What else could he do? What else should he have done? But then he took a good look at Martha Jones, although he did not know that was her name, or even whether she was a man or a woman. And then he said to the albino giraffe, \u201cI think maybe you\u2019d better call an ambulance.\u201d And the roly-poly, rosy policeman, whom Berman would later call \u201ca sentimental hippopotamus,\u201d and who was standing next to him now, was already talking to police headquarters, two blocks away, on his cellphone, on his own having decided that Berman\u2019s \u201cstooge\u201d really might be dead.\nHe thought he had big news, but headquarters had even bigger news for him, which Berman and Sheldon Hayes could hear in the shushing overflow from the instrument\u2019s earpiece. This person was a woman. Her name was Martha Jones. She was a deinstitutionalized mental patient who had stopped taking her pills and run away from her brother-in-law\u2019s house in Ithaca, where she was living; that she often looked dead but really wasn\u2019t; and that her niece Lily Matthews was there at the station right now, ready to drive her aunt back to Ithaca. The cops in Ithaca, as soon as Martha Jones was reported missing but not dangerous, had learned at the bus station there that the unmistakable Martha Jones had bought a bus ticket from Ithaca to Northampton, which would require her to change buses at Syracuse, and then at Springfield.

"sentiment": ["And this apocalyptic warning so suited the wiring of the Captain\u2019s brain, even before his father came down with Huntington\u2019s chorea, that he would ever after believe that that was indeed the most likely way in which humanity would be exterminated: by meteorites.\nTo the Captain, it was such a much more honorable and poetical and even beautiful way for humanity to die than World War Three would be.\nWhen I got to know his big brain better, I understood that there was a certain logic to his thinking about meteorites while he was looking out at Guayaquil with its hungry crowds under martial law. Even without the glamor of a meteorite shower, the world appeared to be ending for the people of Guayaquil.\nIn a sense, too, this man had already been hit by a meteorite: by the murder of his mother by his father. And his feeling that life was a meaningless nightmare, with nobody watching or caring what was going on, was actually quite familiar to me.\nThat was how I felt after I shot a grandmother in Vietnam. She was as toothless and bent over as Mary Hepburn would be at the end of her life. I shot her because she had just killed my best friend and my worst enemy in my platoon with a single hand-grenade.\nThis episode made me sorry to be alive, made me envy stones. I would rather have been a stone at the service of the Natural Order.\nThe Captain went straight from the airport to his ship, without stopping off at the hotel to see his brother. He had been drinking champagne during the long flight from New York City, and so had a splitting headache.\nAnd when we got aboard the Bah\u00eda de Darwin, it was obvious to me that his functions as captain, like his functions as a Reserve admiral, were purely ceremonial. Others would be doing the navigating and engineering and maintaining crew discipline and so on while he socialized with the distinguished passengers. He knew very little about the operation of the ship, nor did he feel he needed to know much about it. His familiarity with the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands was likewise sketchy. He had made ceremonial visits as an admiral to the naval base on the island of Baltra and the Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz\u2014again as essentially a passenger on board a ship of which he was nominally the commander. But all the rest of the islands were terra incognita to him. He would have been a more instructive guide on the ski slopes of Switzerland, say, or on the carpets of the casino at Monte Carlo, or to the stables serving at Palm Beach polo fields.\nBut again\u2014what did that matter? On \u201cthe Nature Cruise of the Century,\u201d there would be guides and lecturers trained at the Darwin Research Station and holding graduate degrees in the natural sciences. The Captain intended to listen to them carefully, and learn about the islands right along with the rest of the passengers.\nRiding in the Captain\u2019s skull, I had hoped to find out what it was like to be a supreme commander. I found out, instead, what it was like to be a social butterfly. We were received with all possible signs of military respect when we came up the gangplank. But, once aboard, no officers or crewmen asked us for instructions about anything as they made the final preparations for the arrival of Mrs. Onassis and the rest of them.", 0.058755752505752504],

this happy marriage of the old and the new? No. Dear Edith was. It was all her idea that I bring my collection out of storage. This house, after all, was an heirloom of the Taft family, full not only of memories of Edith\u2019s happy childhood in summertimes here, but of her very good first marriage, too. When I moved in here from the potato barn, she asked me if I was comfortable in such old-fashioned surroundings. I said truthfully and from the bottom of my heart that I loved it for what it was, and that she shouldn\u2019t change a thing for me.\nSo by God if it wasn\u2019t Edith who called in the contractors, and had them strip off all the wallpaper right down to bare plaster, and take down the chandeliers and put up track lights\u2014and paint the oak baseboards and trim and doors and window sashes and walls a solid oyster-white!\nWhen the work was done, she looked about twenty years younger. She said she had almost gone to her grave without ever realizing what a gift she had for remodeling and decorating. And then she said, \u201cCall Home Sweet Home Moving and Storage,\u201d in whose warehouse I had stored my collection for years and years. \u201cLet them tell your glorious paintings as they bring them out into the daylight, \u2018You are going home!\u2019\u201d\nWhen I walked into my foyer after my trip to New York City, though, a scene so shocking enveloped me that, word of honor, I thought an axe murder had happened there. I am not joking! I thought I was looking at blood and gore! It may have taken me as long as a minute to realize what I was really seeing: wallpaper featuring red roses as big as cabbages against a field of black, babyshit-brown baseboards, trim and doors, and six chromos of little girls on swings, with mats of purple velvet, and with gilded frames which must have weighed as much as the limousine which had delivered me to this catastrophe.\nDid I yell? They tell me I did. What did I yell? They had to tell me afterwards what I yelled. They heard it, and I did not. When the cook and her daughter, the first to arrive, came running, I was yelling this, they say, over and over: \u201cI am in the wrong house! I am in the wrong house!\u201d\nThink of this: my homecoming was a surprise party they had been looking forward to all day long. Now it was all they could do, despite how generous I had always been with them, not to laugh out loud at my maximum agony!\nWhat a world!\nI said to the cook, and I could hear myself now: \u201cWho did this?\u201d\n\u201cMrs. Berman,\u201d she said.

I\u2019ve seen letters to small town newspapers that put Slaughterhouse-Five in the same class with Deep Throat and Hustler magazine. How could anybody masturbate to Slaughterhouse-Five?\nINTERVIEWER: It takes all kinds.\nVONNEGUT: Well, that kind doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s my religion the censors hate. They find me disrespectful toward their idea of God Almighty. They think it\u2019s the proper business of government to protect the reputation of God. All I can say is, \u201cGood luck to them, and good luck to the government, and good luck to God.\u201d You know what H.L. Mencken said one time about religious people? He said he\u2019d been greatly misunderstood. He said he didn\u2019t hate them. He simply found them comical.\nINTERVIEWER: When I asked you a while back which member of your family had influenced you most as a writer, you said your mother. I had expected you to say your sister, since you talked sp much about her in Slapstick.\nVONNEGUT: I said in Slapstick that she was the person I wrote for\u2014that every successful creative person creates with an audience of one in mind. That\u2019s the secret of artistic unity. Anybody can achieve it, if he or she will make something with only one person in mind. I didn\u2019t realize that she was the person I wrote for until after she died.\nINTERVIEWER: She loved literature?\nVONNEGUT: She wrote wonderfully well. She didn\u2019t read much\u2014but, then again, neither in later years did Henry David Thoreau. My father was the same way: he didn\u2019t read much, but he could write like a dream. Such letters my father and sister wrote! When I compare their prose with mine, I am ashamed.\nINTERVIEWER: Did your sister try to write for money, too?\nVONNEGUT: No. She could have been a remarkable sculptor, too. I bawled her out one time for not doing more with the talents she had. She replied that having talent doesn\u2019t carry with it the obligation that something has to be done with it.

I thought it was like imitating birds. You know: You hear a bird make a sound, then you try to make a sound just like that, and see if you can\u2019t fool the bird.\u201d\nThe Chinese were nice about it when he decided that he wanted to go home. They liked him, and they went to some trouble for him, asking through circuitous diplomatic channels what would be done to him if he went home. America had no representatives in China then, and neither did any of its allies. The messages went through Moscow, which was still friendly with China then.\nYes, and this black, former private first class, whose military specialty had been to carry the base-plate of a heavy mortar, turned out to be worth negotiations at the highest diplomatic levels. The Americans wanted him back in order to punish him. The Chinese said that the punishment had to be brief and almost entirely symbolic, and that he had to be returned nearly at once to ordinary civilian life\u2014or they would not let him go. The Americans said that Lawes would of course be expected to make some sort of public explanation of why he had come home. After that, he would be court-martialed, given a prison sentence of under three years and a dishonorable discharge, with forfeiture of all pay and benefits. The Chinese replied that Lawes had given his promise that he would never speak against the People\u2019s Republic of China, which had treated him well. If he was to be forced to break that promise, they would not let him go. They also insisted that he serve no prison time whatsoever, and that he be paid for the time he spent as a prisoner of war. The Americans replied that he would have to be jailed at some point, since no army could allow the crime of desertion to go unpunished. They would like to jail him prior to his trial. They would sentence him to a term equal to the time he had spent as a prisoner of war, and deduct the time he had spent as a prisoner of war, and send him home.

Sure, I knew her. I knew Emily. We went to Ilium High together. We were co-chairmen of the Class Colors Committee then. Her father owned the Ilium Music Store. She could play every musical instrument there was. I fell so hard for her I gave up football and tried to play the violin. And then my big brother Asa came home for spring vacation from M.I.T., and I made the mistake of introducing him to my best girl.\u201d Marvin Breed snapped his fingers. \u201cHe took her away from me just like that. I smashed up my seventy-five-dollar violin on a big brass knob at the foot of my bed, and I went down to a florist shop and got the kind of box they put a dozen roses in, and I put the busted fiddle in the box, and I sent it to her by Western Union messenger boy.\u201d\n\u201cPretty, was she?\u201d\n\u201cPretty?\u201d he echoed. \u201cMister, when I see my first lady angel, if God ever sees fit to show me one, it\u2019ll be her wings and not her face that\u2019ll make my mouth fall open.

She was engaged to my brother, and then that sneaky little bastard hit town.\u201d Marvin Breed snapped his fingers again. \u201cHe took her away from my big brother like that.\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s high treason and ungrateful and ignorant and backward and anti-intellectual to call a dead man as famous as Felix Hoenikker a son of a bitch. I know all about how harmless and gentle and dreamy he was supposed to be, how he\u2019d never hurt a fly, how he didn\u2019t care about money and power and fancy clothes and automobiles and things, how he wasn\u2019t like the rest of us, how he was better than the rest of us, how he was so innocent he was practically a Jesus\u2014except for the Son of God part \u2026\u201d\nMarvin Breed felt it was unnecessary to complete his thought. I had to ask him to do it.\n\u201cBut what?\u201d he said, \u201cBut what?\u201d He went to a window looking out at the cemetery gate. \u201cBut what,\u201d he murmured at the gate and the sleet and the Hoenikker shaft that could be dimly seen.\n\u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cbut how the hell innocent is a man who helps make a thing like an atomic bomb? And how can you say a man had a good mind when he couldn\u2019t even bother to do anything when the best-hearted, most beautiful woman in the world, his own wife, was dying for lack of love and understanding \u2026\u201d", 0.21946952160493824], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["bud", 0.24771474134300353], ["job", 0.1178357192734795], ["personnel", 0.10720099700976275], ["gadget", 0.09169934957341144], ["seventy", 0.09169934957341144], ["longer", 0.07146733133984184], ["machine", 0.06493798050060427], ["better", 0.06002909778715022], ["128", 0.059712618397904635], ["130", 0.059712618397904635], ["eerie", 0.059712618397904635], ["popping", 0.059712618397904635], ["ouah", 0.059712618397904635], ["pecking", 0.059712618397904635], ["129", 0.059712618397904635], ["poof", 0.059712618397904635], ["dice", 0.059712618397904635], ["reset", 0.059712618397904635], ["scare", 0.059712618397904635], ["code", 0.05278114659230518], ["suited", 0.05278114659230518], ["slumped", 0.05278114659230518], ["remorse", 0.05278114659230518], ["acceptable", 0.05278114659230518], ["mixture", 0.05278114659230518], ["sheepishly", 0.05278114659230518], ["turpitude", 0.05278114659230518], ["holes", 0.05278114659230518], ["nicks", 0.05278114659230518], ["moral", 0.04872649551122353], ["petroleum", 0.04872649551122353], ["eliminated", 0.04872649551122353], ["canned", 0.04872649551122353], ["operation", 0.04584967478670572], ["bleakly", 0.04584967478670572], ["invented", 0.04584967478670572], ["couch", 0.04584967478670572], ["offer", 0.04584967478670572], ["bearing", 0.04361823927356362], ["keyboard", 0.04361823927356362], ["pride", 0.04361823927356362], ["slipped", 0.04361823927356362], ["runs", 0.04361823927356362], ["amazed", 0.04361823927356362], ["recognize", 0.04179502370562408], ["combination", 0.04179502370562408], ["yup", 0.040253516907351496], ["raise", 0.03774037262454243], ["jobs", 0.03774037262454243], ["lower", 0.03774037262454243], ["snapped", 0.03774037262454243], ["thet", 0.03774037262454243], ["deal", 0.03774037262454243], ["cards", 0.03774037262454243], ["names", 0.03668676746796417], ["council", 0.03668676746796417], ["fingers", 0.03668676746796417], ["machines", 0.03624757512861582], ["classification", 0.03332204510175204], ["promise", 0.03332204510175204], ["number", 0.031986731175506815], ["full", 0.031986731175506815], ["cut", 0.03138048495734246], ["seconds", 0.030808900818942976], ["national", 0.028802193864321465], ["earth", 0.027131653017689807], ["fine", 0.027131653017689807], ["living", 0.026039660098039884], ["lot", 0.024747542783239825], ["country", 0.024449013151743013], ["smiled", 0.023877429013343523], ["manager", 0.02307700193660816], ["open", 0.022100617240969005], ["works", 0.019282105719559125], ["men", 0.014069136483226264], ["paul", 0.005958771452379402]], "sentiment": ["\u201cTrying to scare the National Petroleum Council into giving you a raise?

"sentiment": ["ROBERT W. MOELLENKAMP hadn\u2019t heard yet that he and his wife and kids were as broke as any convict in Athena. So when I came into the Board Room back in 1991, he addressed me in the statesmanlike tones of a prudent conservator of a noble legacy. He nodded in the direction of Jason Wilder, who was then simply a Tarkington parent, not a member of the Board. Wilder sat at the opposite end of the great oval table with a manila folder, a tape recorder and cassettes, and a Polaroid photograph deployed before him.\nI knew who he was, of course, and something of how his mind worked, having read his newspaper column and watched his television show from time to time. But we had not met before. The Board members on either side of him had crowded into one another in order to give him plenty of room for some kind of performance.\nHe was the only celebrity there. He was probably the only true celebrity ever to set foot in that Board Room.\nThere was 1 other non-Trustee present. That was the College President, Henry \u201cTex\u201d Johnson, whose wife Zuzu, as I\u2019ve already said, I used to make love to when he was away from home any length of time. Zuzu and I had broken up for good about a month before, but we were still on speaking terms.\n\u201cPLEASE TAKE A seat, Gene,\u201d said Moellenkamp. \u201cMr. Wilder, who I guess you know is Kimberley\u2019s father, has a rather disturbing story he wants to tell to you.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d I said, a good soldier doing as he was told. I wanted to keep my job. This was my home. When the time came, I wanted to retire here and then be buried here. That was before it was clear that glaciers were headed south again, and that anybody buried here, including the gang by the stable, along with Musket Mountain itself, would eventually wind up in Pennsylvania or West Virginia. Or Maryland.\nWhere else could I become a Full Professor or a college teacher of any rank, with nothing but a Bachelor of Science Degree from West Point? I couldn\u2019t even teach high school or grade school, since I had never taken any of the required courses in education. At my age, which was then 51, who would hire me for anything, and especially with a demented wife and mother-in-law in tow.\nI said to the Trustees and Jason Wilder, \u201cI believe I know most of what the story is, ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019ve just been with Kimberley, and she gave me a pretty good rehearsal for what I\u2019d better say here.\n\u201cWhen listening to her charges against me, I can only hope you did not lose sight of what you yourselves have learned about me during my 15 years of faithful service to Tarkington. This Board itself, surely, can provide all the character witnesses I could ever need. If not, bring in parents and students. Choose them at random. You know and I know that they will all speak well of me.\u201d\nI nodded respectfully in Jason Wilder\u2019s direction. \u201cI am glad to meet you in person, sir. I read your columns and watch your TV show regularly. I find what you have to say invariably thought-provoking, and so do my wife and her mother, both of them invalids.\u201d I wanted to get that in about my 2 sick dependents, in case Wilder and a couple of new Trustees hadn\u2019t heard about them.", 0.17163079777365498], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["plummer", 0.2581949507110542], ["quash", 0.18261076303223], ["helmholtz", 0.15355337074204103], ["band", 0.10272621906893067], ["flammer", 0.09885275267423438], ["sooner", 0.09885275267423438], ["point", 0.08329658083385669], ["rounded", 0.06087025434407667], ["criticism", 0.06087025434407667], ["ruining", 0.06087025434407667], ["sore", 0.06087025434407667], ["sided", 0.06087025434407667], ["kindly", 0.06087025434407667], ["mature", 0.06087025434407667], ["today", 0.060398029955519156], ["kids", 0.059329419655778516], ["sport", 0.0536499712132439], ["chances", 0.0536499712132439], ["weak", 0.0536499712132439], ["finality", 0.0536499712132439], ["brightness", 0.0536499712132439], ["worthwhile", 0.04942637633711719], ["headed", 0.04942637633711719], ["material", 0.04942637633711719], ["miracle", 0.04942637633711719], ["points", 0.04942637633711719], ["incidents", 0.04942637633711719], ["view", 0.04942637633711719], ["unexpected", 0.04642968808241114], ["competition", 0.04642968808241114], ["fair", 0.044105276089554786], ["frankly", 0.044105276089554786], ["challenging", 0.044105276089554786], ["explain", 0.044105276089554786], ["beat", 0.044105276089554786], ["june", 0.044105276089554786], ["challenge", 0.04220609320628442], ["better", 0.04197714626129718], ["heck", 0.04060035695808382], ["loose", 0.04060035695808382], ["bass", 0.039209404951578375], ["played", 0.03798249833015771], ["waved", 0.0358921785857603], ["straight", 0.03498581007545166], ["silence", 0.03498581007545166], ["guy", 0.03415203187051899], ["awful", 0.033380073827251056], ["speaking", 0.033380073827251056], ["standing", 0.03266139808259531], ["hold", 0.03266139808259531], ["ahead", 0.03266139808259531], ["bad", 0.03266139808259531], ["foot", 0.031989121820745606], ["drum", 0.031989121820745606], ["thing", 0.031244562399534912], ["happened", 0.030199014977759578], ["em", 0.029664709827889258], ["playing", 0.029664709827889258], ["job", 0.028671895454927536], ["heart", 0.027765526944618896], ["chair", 0.027340297835032903], ["play", 0.027340297835032903], ["lost", 0.026931748739686224], ["square", 0.026538620323198234], ["days", 0.024768838689912843], ["feel", 0.023256526087365993], ["door", 0.02012001470420014], ["turned", 0.01931833719236547], ["big", 0.016467338958229626], ["good", 0.012292763780409298]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYou\u2019ve got a point,\u201d said Plummer with unexpected brightness. \u201cA guy\u2019s got to be awful one-sided to be as good at one thing as Flammer is.
