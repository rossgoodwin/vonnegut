recent letter to you. It\u2019s this business about the school: school of painting, school of poetry, school of music, school of writing. For a couple of years after the war I was a graduate student in the Anthropology Department at the University of Chicago. At the instigation of a bright and neurotic instructor named Slotkin, I got interested in the notion of the school (I\u2019m going to explain what I mean in a minute), and decided to do a thesis on the subject. I did about 40 pages of the thing, based on the Cubist School in Paris, and then got told by the faculty that I\u2019d better pick something more strictly anthropological. They suggested rather firmly (with Slotkin abstaining) that I interest myself in the Indian Ghost Dance of 1894. Shortly thereafter I ran out of money and signed on with G-E, and I never did get past the note-taking stage on the Ghost Dance business (albeit damn interesting).\nBut Slotkin\u2019s notion of the importance of the school stuck with me, and it now seems pertinent to you, me, Knox, McQuade, and anybody else whose literary fortunes we take a personal interest in. What Slotkin said was this: no man who achieved greatness in the arts operated by himself; he was top man in a group of like-minded individuals. This works out fine for the cubists, and Slotkin had plenty of good evidence for its applying to Goethe, Thoreau, Hemingway, and just about anybody you care to name.\nIf it isn\u2019t 100% true, it\u2019s true enough to be interesting\u2014and maybe helpful.\nThe school gives a man, Slotkin said, the fantastic amount of guts it takes to add to culture. It gives him morale, esprit de corps, the resources of many brains, and\u2014maybe most important\u2014one-sidedness with assurance. (My reporting what Slotkin said four years ago is pretty subjective\u2014so let\u2019s say Vonnegut, a Slotkin derivative, is saying this.) About this one-sidedness: I\u2019m convinced that no one can amount to a damn in the arts if he becomes sweetly reasonable, seeing all sides of a picture, forgiving all sins.\nSlotkin also said a person in the arts can\u2019t help but belong to some school\u2014good or bad. I don\u2019t know what school you belong to. My school is presently comprised of Littauer & Wilkinson (my agents), and Burger, and nobody else. For want of support from any other quarter, I write for them\u2014high grade, slick bombast.\nI\u2019ve been on my own for five weeks now. I\u2019ve rewritten a novelette, and turned out a short-short and a couple of 5000-worders. Some of them will sell, probably. This is Sunday, and the question arises, what\u2019ll I start tomorrow? I already know what the answer is. I also know it\u2019s the wrong answer. I\u2019ll start something to please L&W, Inc., and Burger, and, please, God, MGM.", 0.16041666666666668], "title": "Letters"}, "timequake": {"tfidf": [["dillinger", 0.13100784521664835],

that he had been handed his head on a platter. We are being handed our heads with tweeters now.\u201d\nHe was speaking, of course, of microchips.\n10\nAllie died in New Jersey.

So is John Dillinger, the beloved bank robber of the 1930s. So are our parents, Kurt and Edith, and Father\u2019s kid brother Alex Vonnegut, the Harvard-educated life insurance salesman who said, whenever life was good, \u201cIf this isn\u2019t nice, what is?\u201d So are two previous generations of our parents\u2019 forebears : a brewer, an architect, merchants and musicians, and their wives, of course.\nFull house!\nJohn Dillinger, a farm boy, escaped from jail once brandishing a wooden pistol he had whittled from a broken washtub slat. He blackened it with shoe polish! He was so entertaining. While on the run, robbing banks and vanishing into the boondocks, Dillinger wrote Henry Ford a fan letter. He thanked the old anti-Semite for making such fast and agile getaway cars!\nIt was possible to get away from the police back then if you were a better driver with a better car. Talk about fair play! Talk about what we say we want for everyone in America: a level playing field! And Dillinger robbed only the rich and strong, banks with armed guards, and in person.\nDillinger wasn\u2019t a simpering, sly swindler. He was an athlete.\nIn the slavering search for subversive literature on the shelves of our public schools, which will never stop, the two most subversive tales of all remain untouched, wholly unsuspected.

The penalty for that was $10,000 and ten years in jail.\nThis was at a time when the population of Earth was 17 billion human beings. That was far too many mammals that big for a planet that small. The people were virtually packed together like drupelets.\nDrupelets are the pulpy little knobs that compose the outside of a raspberry.\nSo the World Government was making a two-pronged attack on overpopulation. One pronging was the encouragement of ethical suicide, which consisted of going to the nearest Suicide Parlor and asking a Hostess to kill you painlessly while you lay on a Barcalounger. The other pronging was compulsory ethical birth control.\nThe sheriff told the Hostesses, who were pretty, tough-minded, highly intelligent girls, that roadblocks were being set up and house-to-house searches were being conducted to catch Billy the Poet. The main difficulty was that the police didn\u2019t know what he looked like. The few people who had seen him and known him for what he was were women\u2014and they disagreed fantastically as to his height, his hair color, his voice, his weight, the color of his skin.\n\"I don\u2019t need to remind you girls,\" the sheriff went on, \"that a nothinghead is very sensitive from the waist down. If Billy the Poet somehow slips in here and starts making trouble, one good kick in the right place will do wonders.\"", 0.16214417989417992], "title": "Welcome to the Monkey House"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["prom", 0.13503853699219573], ["senior", 0.1130438598320414], ["celia", 0.08574476669584032], ["peeled", 0.08565623022867201], ["banana", 0.08565623022867201], ["soup", 0.08565623022867201], ["stew", 0.07438554436590868], ["meat", 0.06779261577878404], ["pepper", 0.06779261577878404], ["invited", 0.06311485850314533], ["teaspoon", 0.05184417264038199], ["haitian", 0.04992900132889608], ["bananas", 0.042828115114336006], ["yams", 0.042828115114336006], ["compelling", 0.042828115114336006], ["expectation", 0.042828115114336006], ["introduce", 0.042828115114336006], ["cutest", 0.042828115114336006], ["advance", 0.042828115114336006], ["bon", 0.042828115114336006], ["miracles", 0.042828115114336006], ["app", 0.042828115114336006], ["cinderella", 0.042828115114336006], ["scant", 0.042828115114336006], ["ride", 0.042828115114336006], ["servings", 0.042828115114336006], ["tit", 0.042828115114336006], ["goat", 0.042828115114336006], ["quarts", 0.042828115114336006], ["hildreth", 0.04162289362538404], ["felix", 0.03886369725812434], ["beautiful", 0.03865831546613274], ["bringing", 0.03719277218295434], ["pounds", 0.03719277218295434], ["pinch", 0.03719277218295434], ["tender", 0.03719277218295434], ["red", 0.03719277218295434], ["star", 0.03719277218295434], ["impression", 0.03389630788939202], ["whatsoever", 0.03389630788939202], ["ignored", 0.03389630788939202], ["richest", 0.03389630788939202], ["chunks", 0.03389630788939202], ["instance", 0.03389630788939202], ["half", 0.03267905074864791], ["arm", 0.03155742925157266], ["simmer", 0.03155742925157266], ["crushed", 0.03155742925157266], ["chicken", 0.029743254037636002], ["talked", 0.029743254037636002], ["movie", 0.029743254037636002], ["boys", 0.029743254037636002], ["onions", 0.029743254037636002], ["three", 0.028802448741412166], ["weeks", 0.02826096495801035], ["fool", 0.02826096495801035], ["happen", 0.02826096495801035], ["chopped", 0.02826096495801035], ["class", 0.02826096495801035], ["appeared", 0.025922086320190996], ["hour", 0.025922086320190996], ["add", 0.02496450066444804], ["salt", 0.02496450066444804], ["bring", 0.024107911106254334], ["minute", 0.024107911106254334], ["president", 0.024107911106254334], ["cup", 0.023333031595650065], ["water", 0.023333031595650065], ["feel", 0.022625622026628683], ["artist", 0.022625622026628683], ["bus", 0.022625622026628683], ["cut", 0.021974868305705626], ["reason", 0.020286743388809328], ["studio", 0.020286743388809328], ["born", 0.01932915773306637], ["friends", 0.018075900173495165], ["black", 0.017697688664268393], ["car", 0.017697688664268393], ["supposed", 0.017697688664268393], ["wouldn", 0.01733629222060308], ["father", 0.015920430298099236], ["couldn", 0.01573702153567581], ["left", 0.013922846321739143], ["night", 0.012837225243490994], ["town", 0.012837225243490994], ["heard", 0.012636472295601792], ["long", 0.012440557242113496], ["lot", 0.012440557242113496], ["going", 0.009144092948551183]], "sentiment": ["This was Celia Hildreth.\nSo she could have had scant expectation of being invited to the senior prom.

He spoke unintelligibly of the sacrifices he had made on Billy\u2019s behalf. He dilated upon the piety and heroism of \u201cThe Three Musketeers,\u201d portrayed, in the most glowing and impassioned hues, their virtue and magnanimity, the imperishable honor they acquired for themselves, and the great services they rendered to Christianity.\nIt was entirely Billy\u2019s fault that this fighting organization no longer existed, Weary felt, and Billy was going to pay. Weary socked Billy a good one on the side of his jaw, knocked Billy away from the bank and onto the snow-covered ice of the creek. Billy was down on all fours on the ice, and Weary kicked him in the ribs, rolled him over on his side. Billy tried to form himself into a ball.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t even be in the Army,\u201d said Weary.\nBilly was involuntarily making convulsive sounds that were a lot like laughter. \u201cYou think it\u2019s funny, huh?\u201d Weary inquired. He walked around to Billy\u2019s back. Billy\u2019s jacket and shirt and undershirt had been hauled up around his shoulders by the violence, so his back was naked. There, inches from the tips of Weary\u2019s combat boots, were the pitiful buttons of Billy\u2019s spine.\nWeary drew back his right boot, aimed a kick at the spine, at the tube which had so many of Billy\u2019s important wires in it. Weary was going to break that tube.\nBut then Weary saw that he had an audience. Five German soldiers and a police dog on a leash were looking down into the bed of the creek. The soldiers\u2019 blue eyes were filled with a bleary civilian curiosity as to why one American would try to murder another one so far from home, and why the victim should laugh.\n3\nTHE GERMANS AND THE DOG were engaged in a military operation which had an amusingly self-explanatory name, a human enterprise which is seldom described in detail, whose name alone, when reported as news or history, gives many war enthusiasts a sort of post-coital satisfaction. It is, in the imagination of combat\u2019s fans, the divinely listless loveplay that follows the orgasm of victory. It is called \u201cmopping up.\u201d\nThe dog, who had sounded so ferocious in the winter distances, was a female German shepherd. She was shivering. Her tail was between her legs. She had been borrowed that morning from a farmer. She had never been to war before. She had no idea what game was being played. Her name was Princess.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022", 0.15891439909297048], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["rowley", 0.19709014740628822], ["pilot", 0.11649402658459761], ["die", 0.11649402658459761], ["nauseously", 0.112408017314343], ["eyes", 0.10131451397956945], ["shuffled", 0.09854507370314411], ["cockpit", 0.09854507370314411], ["ramshackle", 0.09854507370314411], ["beg", 0.09854507370314411], ["itinerary", 0.09854507370314411], ["unusual", 0.09043577154098081], ["wondering", 0.09043577154098081], ["evening", 0.09043577154098081], ["presumably", 0.0846821300919452], ["cheerful", 0.0846821300919452], ["dome", 0.0846821300919452], ["rocked", 0.080219259065661], ["bird", 0.080219259065661], ["cover", 0.080219259065661], ["titan", 0.07726085646412854], ["ended", 0.0765728279297819], ["plastic", 0.0765728279297819], ["helicopter", 0.0765728279297819], ["pardon", 0.07348981433323673], ["constant", 0.07144104376038476], ["places", 0.0684635257676186], ["thin", 0.06445011185837558], ["cold", 0.061109030165112266], ["sky", 0.061109030165112266], ["climbed", 0.059626870722037824], ["going", 0.05158670101723276], ["wanted", 0.04969813299576001], ["inside", 0.04884694070738409], ["great", 0.034167557205780075], ["god", 0.034167557205780075], ["looked", 0.03226135360969358], ["things", 0.031546991957651996], ["malachi", 0.025531908877269322], ["earth", 0.025273840780551168], ["rumfoord", 0.015057328305231352]], "sentiment": ["Then Earth again.\nThen Titan.\nSince the itinerary ended on Titan, presumably that was where Malachi Constant was going to die.

incidentally, or so I\u2019ve been told, it was the women and not the men who were the fisherfolk.\nAnd what a terrific bite my letter got!\nWe hooked Dan Gregory\u2019s mistress, a former Ziegfeld Follies showgirl named Marilee Kemp!\nThis woman would become the very first woman I ever made love to\u2014at the age of nineteen! And, oh, my God, what a fuddy-duddy old poop I am, thinking about that sexual initiation as though it were as marvelous as the Chrysler Building\u2014while the fifteen-year-old daughter of my cook is taking birth-control pills!\nMarilee Kemp said that she was Mr. Gregory\u2019s assistant, and that she and he had been deeply moved by my letter. Mr. Gregory, as I might imagine, was a very busy man, and had asked her to reply for him. This was a four-page letter, written in a scrawl almost as childish as my own. She was then only twenty-one years old\u2014the daughter of an illiterate coal miner in West Virginia.\nWhen she was thirty-seven, she would be the Countess Portomaggiori, with a pink palace in Florence, Italy. When she was fifty, she would be the biggest Sony distributor in Europe, and that old continent\u2019s greatest collector of American postwar modern art.\nMy father said she had to be crazy to write such a long letter to a stranger, and nothing but a boy at that, so far away.\nMother said she must be very lonely, which was true. Gregory kept her as a pet around the house, because she was so beautiful, and he used her as a model sometimes. But she was certainly no assistant in his business. He had no interest in her opinions about anything.\nHe never included her in his dinner parties, either, never took her on trips or to a show or out to restaurants or to other people\u2019s parties, or introduced her to his famous friends.\nMarilee Kemp wrote me seventy-eight letters between 1927 and 1933.

So was Adolf Hitler.\nWhat can be said to our young people, now that psychopathic personalities, which is to say persons without consciences, without senses of pity or shame, have taken all the money in the treasuries of our government and corporations, and made it all their own?\nAnd the most I can give you to cling to is a poor thing, actually. Not much better than nothing, and maybe it\u2019s a little worse than nothing. It is the idea of a truly modern hero. It is the bare bones of the life of Ignaz Semmelweis, my hero.\nIgnaz Semmelweis was born in Budapest in 1818. His life overlapped with that of my grandfather and with that of your grandfathers, and it may seem a long time ago, but actually he lived only yesterday.\nHe became an obstetrician, which should make him modern hero enough. He devoted his life to the health of babies and mothers. We could use more heroes like that. There\u2019s damn little caring for mothers, babies, old people, or anybody physically or economically weak these days as we become ever more industrialized and militarized with the guessers in charge.\nI have said to you how new all this information is. It is so new that the idea that many diseases are caused by germs is only about 140 years old. The house I own in Sagaponack, Long Island, is nearly twice that old. I don\u2019t know how they lived long enough to finish it. I mean, the germ theory is really recent. When my father was a little boy, Louis Pasteur was still alive and still plenty controversial. There were still plenty of high-powered guessers who were furious at people who would listen to him instead of to them.\nYes, and Ignaz Semmelweis also believed that germs could cause diseases. He was horrified when he went to work for a maternity hospital in Vienna, Austria, to find out that one mother in ten was dying of childbed fever.\nThese were poor people\u2014rich people still had their babies at home. Semmelweis observed hospital routines, and began to suspect that doctors were bringing the infection to the patients. He noticed that the doctors often went directly from dissecting corpses in the morgue to examining mothers in the maternity ward. He suggested as an experiment that the doctors wash their hands before touching the mothers.\nWhat could be more insulting? How dare he make such a suggestion to his social superiors? He was a nobody, he realized. He was from out of town, with no friends and protectors among the Austrian nobility. But all that dying went on and on, and Semmelweis, having far less sense about how to get along with others in this world than you and I would have, kept on asking his colleagues to wash their hands.\nThey at last agreed to do this in a spirit of lampoonery, of satire, of scorn.

Kurt\u2019s mother, Nannie Schnull Vonnegut, died in 1929 and left Kurt his share of her then modest fortune derived from her father, Henry Schnull. They soon used this up. Kurt had acquired a plot of land on the east side of North Illinois Street at about Forty-fifth Street. Here he designed and built a large and very beautiful brick residence. They sent their older children in the twenties and thirties to private schools; Bernard to Park School, and Alice to Tudor Hall School for girls. Bernard went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he took his degree of Bachelor of Science and remained to take his Ph.D. degree in Chemistry. He became and remains a distinguished scientist. Alice married James Adams. But by the time K came along to his adolescence, the family was in financial trouble. He knew only the hard times of the 1930s. He was taken out of private school after the third grade, and sent to Public School No. 43 and then Shortridge High School. He was sent to Cornell University with specific instructions not to waste time or money on \u2019frivolous\u2019 courses, but to give full attention to practical studies, principally physics and chemistry and math.\n\u201cHis parents were in straitened circumstances. There was practically no building in the Depression years and Kurt\u2019s professional income vanished. They began to live on their capital which, to a good bourgeois, is a heresy looked upon with horror and usually followed by disaster.\n\u201cIt was obvious to them that they could not continue to support so large an establishment. This residence, by then heavily mortgaged, was sold. It still stands and is now the home of Evans Woollen HI, a descendent of a well-known family and a distinguished architect in his own right. With the proceeds of their equity in this property and a few remaining assets, Kurt and Edith then purchased an attractive plot of land in William\u2019s Creek\u2014a suburban development lying about nine miles due north of Monument Circle, to which many of the leading families migrated to escape the deteriorating conditions of the inner city. Here Kurt designed and built in 1941 a somewhat smaller and less pretentious dwelling, but it was well constructed of brick. It was surrounded by tall virginal forest trees\u2014oaks, maples, and elms. It was a most attractive home, was well furnished, and displayed Kurt\u2019s artistic skills. In the basement Kurt had a small shop where he installed a kiln and dabbled in ceramics in which he produced some beautiful pieces. Here the family lived quietly and modestly with but little entertaining or traveling.\n\u201cThey continued to invade their diminishing capital. But Kurt had two $1,000 corporate bonds which he had inherited from his mother. Edith, true to her delusions to grandeur, said: \u2019Let\u2019s take one more trip abroad.\u2019 So they sold the two bonds, went to Paris for three weeks and returned broke. But it was a rate example of \u00e9sprit\u2014what the French call panache. It was going out with flair\u2014all banners flying.\n\u201cMeanwhile came the Second World War in December 1941 and once again America was arrayed against Germany. Bernard at twenty-four escaped the draft, but Kurt, Jr., at nineteen was caught. He was enlisted in the army as a private and sent to training camp. This came as a great shock with acute distress to Edith. With her other financial problems the prospect of losing her son in the impending holocaust made her cup of troubles overflow. She became despondent and morose. Wanting money desperately, she attempted to write short stories which she could sell, but it was a futile, hopeless venture; a tragic disillusion. She simply could not see daylight. Kurt, Jr., got leave from his regiment to come home and spend Mother\u2019s Day in May 1944 with his family. During the night before, Edith died in her sleep in her fifty-sixth year on May 14, 1944. Her death was attributed to an overdose of sleeping tablets taken possibly by mistake. Her gross estate was inventoried in probate at $10,815.50. It was all that was left as her share of her grandfather\u2019s fortune and of her father\u2019s residue.\n\u201cShe missed by a matter of two months the birth of her first grandchild, the son of her daughter Alice. She would miss seeing twelve grandchildren in all. She missed by seven months the capture of her son K by the Germans in the Batde of the Bulge, and his imprisonment in Dresden until the end of the war.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u201cAfter Edith\u2019s death Kurt lived almost as a recluse, for some ten years. But his sister, Irma Vonnegut Lindener, who was then a resident of Hamburg, Germany, paid him protracted visits\u2014sometimes for months at a time. They were very congenial and deeply attached to each other. She understood his vagaries, respected his privacy and fierce independence, and gave him the only sort of companionship which he would tolerate. They resembled each other in many ways and were deeply empathetic. They were both blond and blue-eyed. They both spoke German fluently and shared their attachment to their German traditions of music and literature. Kurt acquired a sort of skeptical and fatalistic contempt for life\u2014what the Germans call Weltschmerz.\n\u201cAs Kurt aged and his fortunes waned, he could not continue to support this last abode of modest elegance. He sold it, and with the pittance left to him, some ten thousand dollars, Kurt then bought a small cottage in the country on a little hill on a winding road just north of Nashville, in Brown County, about twenty-five miles south of Indianapolis. Brown County is still a bucolic community but it has some of the highest hills and loveliest scenery in the Midwest. It is the abode of preference of artists. Here Kurt retired alone and lived in perfect seclusion.

He looks about forty-five. Actually, I guess, he\u2019s younger than I am. He\u2019s pretty good-looking, and I think he must have been a pretty good athlete at one time.

They all smelled of booze, of course, too\u2014\" He nodded and blinked. \"Booze and fire engines\u2014a happy childhood regained. I don't know, I don't know, I just don't know. Whenever we went out there, I told him it was home\u2014but I never thought he would be dumb enough to believe it.\"\n\"I blame myself,\" said the Senator.\n\"Good for you,\" said McAllister. \"And, while you're at it, be sure to hold yourself responsible for everything that happened to Eliot during World War Two. It's your fault, without a doubt, that all those firemen were in that smoke-filled building.\"\nMcAllister was speaking of the proximate cause of Eliot's nervous breakdown near the end of the war. The smoke-filled building was a clarinet factory in Bavaria. It was supposedly infested by a hedgehog of S.S. troops.\nEliot led a platoon from his company in an assault on the building. His customary weapon was a Thompson submachinegun. But he went in with a rifle and fixed bayonet this time, because of the danger of shooting one of his own men in the smoke. He had never stuck a bayonet into anybody before, not in years of carnage.\nHe pitched a grenade into a window. When it went off, Captain Rosewater went through the window himself, found himself standing in a sea of very still smoke whose undulating surface was level with his eyes. He tilted his head back to keep his nose in air. He could hear Germans, but he couldn't see them.\nHe took a step forward, stumbled over one body, fell on another. They were Germans who had been killed by his grenade. He stood up, found himself face-to-face with a helmeted German in a gas mask.\nEliot, like the good soldier he was, jammed his knee into the man's groin, drove his bayonet into his throat, withdrew the bayonet, smashed the man's jaw with his rifle butt.\nAnd then Eliot heard an American sergeant yelling somewhere off to his left. The visibility was apparently a lot better over there, for the sergeant was yelling, \"Cease fire! Hold your fire, you guys. Jesus Christ\u2014these aren't soldiers. They're firemen!\"", 0.19791666666666666], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["ruth", 0.07322627102286439], ["lively", 0.044026697739483235], ["goods",

"sentiment": ["It was vitamins and minerals and protein and, of course, tender, loving care, that made all the difference to Ruth. After only three weeks in the hospital she was a sane and witty Viennese intellectual. I hired her as my personal interpreter and took her everywhere with me. Through another Harvard acquaintance, a shady colonel in the Quartermaster Corps in Wiesbaden\u2014a black marketeer, I\u2019m sure\u2014I was able to get her a suitable wardrobe, for which, mysteriously, I was never asked to pay anyone. The woolens were from Scotland, the cottons from Egypt\u2014the silks from China, I suppose. The shoes were French\u2014and prewar. One pair, I remember, was alligator, and came with a bag to match. The goods were priceless, since no store in Europe, or in North America, for that matter, had offered anything like them for years. The sizes, moreover, were exactly right for Ruth. These blackmarket treasures were delivered to my office in cartons claiming to contain mimeograph paper belonging to the Royal Canadian Air Force. Two taciturn young male citizens delivered them in what had once been a Wehrmacht ambulance. Ruth guessed that one was Belgian and the other, like my mother, Lithuanian.\nMy accepting those goods was surely my most corrupt act as a public servant, and my only corrupt act\u2014until Watergate. I did it for love.\nI began to speak to Ruth of love almost as soon as she got out of the hospital and went to work for me. Her replies were kind of funny and perceptive\u2014but above all pessimistic. She believed, and was entitled to believe, I must say, that all human beings were evil by nature, whether tormentors or victims, or idle standers-by. They could only create meaningless tragedies, she said, since they weren\u2019t nearly intelligent enough to accomplish all the good they meant to do. We were a disease, she said, which had evolved on one tiny cinder in the universe, but could spread and spread.\n\u201cHow can you speak of love to a woman,\u201d she asked me early in our courtship, \u201cwho feels that it would be just as well if nobody had babies anymore, if the human race did not go on?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I know you don\u2019t really believe that,\u201d I replied. \u201cRuth\u2014look at how full of life you are!\u201d It was true. There was no movement or sound she made that was not at least accidentally flirtatious\u2014and what is flirtatiousness but an argument that life must go on and on and on?\nWhat a charmer she was! Oh, I got the credit for how smoothly things ran. My own country gave me a Distinguished Service Medal, and France made me a chevalier in the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur, and Great Britain and the Soviet Union sent me letters of commendation and thanks. But it was Ruth who worked all the miracles, who kept each guest in a state of delighted forgivingness, no matter what went wrong.\n\u201cHow can you dislike life and still be so lively?\u201d I asked her.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have a child, even if I wanted to,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how lively I am.\u201d\nShe was wrong about that, of course. She was only guessing. She would give birth to a son by and by, a very unpleasant person, who, as I have already said, is now a book reviewer for The New York Times.\nThat conversation with Ruth in Nuremberg went on. We were in Saint Martha\u2019s Church, close to where fate had first brought us together. It was not yet operating as a church again. The roof had been put back on\u2014but there was a canvas flap where the rose window used to be. The window and the altar, an old custodian told us, had been demolished by a single cannon shell from a British fighter plane. To him, judging from his solemnity, this was yet another religious miracle. And I must say that I seldom met a male German who was saddened by all the destruction in his own country. It was always the ballistics of whatever had done the wrecking that he wished to talk about.", 0.14153784387655352], "title": "Jailbird"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["song", 0.33598149992604515], ["sang", 0.20995439479044734], ["1782", 0.13878925498351366], ["hanged", 0.13878925498351366], ["scaffold", 0.13878925498351366], ["minor", 0.13878925498351366], ["historical", 0.13878925498351366], ["hangings", 0.13878925498351366], ["outfitted", 0.13878925498351366], ["moakely", 0.13878925498351366], ["stockade", 0.13878925498351366], ["occasion", 0.13878925498351366], ["tone", 0.12188322618936866], ["george", 0.12188322618936866], ["society", 0.12188322618936866], ["county", 0.10497719739522367], ["crime", 0.10497719739522367], ["wondered", 0.09953467175341366], ["murdered", 0.09953467175341366], ["public", 0.09508780451453672], ["composed", 0.09132803183582311], ["people", 0.09129572179271296], ["paid", 0.08807116860107865], ["interesting", 0.08262864295926865], ["held", 0.07818177572039171], ["interested", 0.07442200304167809], ["laboratory", 0.06697367012579561], ["suppose", 0.06697367012579561], ["twenty", 0.06697367012579561], ["find", 0.0623137863023149], ["better", 0.0623137863023149], ["general", 0.05583322128443671], ["thought", 0.05278046170019266], ["wasn", 0.048214326527311044], ["book", 0.04594382840374977], ["man", 0.02671316107779196]], "sentiment": ["\u201cPeople used to get outfitted here.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very interesting.\u201d\n\u201cJust about where the Research Laboratory is now was the old stockade.

Justice swift and justice sure.\nLet me hasten to say that no unit under my command was encouraged to engage in the mutilation of bodies of enemies, nor would I have winked at it if I had heard about it. One platoon in a battalion I led, on its own initiative, took to leaving aces of spades on the bodies of enemies, as sort of calling cards, I guess. This wasn\u2019t mutilation, strictly speaking, but still I put a stop to it.\nWhat a footsoldier can do to a body with his pipsqueak technology is nothing, of course, when compared with the ordinary, unavoidable, perfectly routine effects of aerial bombing and artillery. One time I saw the severed head of a bearded old man resting on the guts of an eviscerated water buffalo, covered with flies in a bomb crater by a paddy in Cambodia. The plane whose bomb made the crater was so high when it dropped it that it couldn\u2019t even be seen from the ground. But what its bomb did, I would have to say, sure beat the ace of spades for a calling card.\nI DON\u2019T THINK Jack Patton would have wanted the sniper who killed him mutilated, but you never know. When he was alive he was like a dead man in 1 respect: everything was pretty much all right with him.\nEverything, and I mean everything, was a joke to him, or so he said. His favorite expression right up to the end was, \u201cI had to laugh like hell.\u201d If Lieutenant Colonel Patton is in Heaven, and I don\u2019t think many truly professional soldiers have ever expected to wind up there, at least not recently, he might at this very moment be telling about how his life suddenly stopped in Hue, and then adding, without even smiling, \u201cI had to laugh like hell.\u201d That was the thing: Patton would tell about some supposedly serious or beautiful or dangerous or holy event during which he had had to laugh like hell, but he hadn\u2019t really laughed. He kept a straight face, too, when he told about it afterward. In all his life, I don\u2019t think anybody ever heard him do what he said he had to do all the time, which was laugh like hell.\nHe said he had to laugh like hell when he won a science prize in high school for making an electric chair for rats, but he hadn\u2019t. A lot of people wanted him to stage a public demonstration of the chair with a tranquilized rat, wanted him to shave the head of a groggy rat and strap it to the chair, and, according to Jack, ask it if it had any last words to say, maybe wanted to express remorse for the life of crime it had led.\nThe execution never took place. There was enough common sense in Patton\u2019s high school, although not in the Science Department, apparently, to have such an event denounced as cruelty to dumb animals. Again, Jack Patton said without smiling, \u201cI had to laugh like hell.\u201d\nHE SAID HE had to laugh like hell when I married his sister Margaret. He said Margaret and I shouldn\u2019t take offense at that. He said he had to laugh like hell when anybody got married.\nI am absolutely sure that Jack did not know that there was inheritable insanity on his mother\u2019s side of the family, and neither did his sister, who would become my bride. When I married Margaret, their mother seemed perfectly OK still, except for a mania for dancing, which was a little scary sometimes, but harmless. Dancing until she dropped wasn\u2019t nearly as loony as wanting to bomb North Vietnam back to the Stone Age, or bombing anyplace back to the Stone Age.\nMY MOTHER-IN-LAW MILDRED grew up in Peru, Indiana, but never talked about Peru, even after she went crazy, except to say that Cole Porter, a composer of ultrasophisticated popular songs during the first half of the last century, was also born in Peru.", 0.1402784503631961], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["hurty", 0.3125417005452978], ["labyrinth", 0.2711389787636143], ["colonel", 0.26322477383927817], ["picturesque", 0.1669584119151817], ["hedge", 0.1669584119151817], ["commanded", 0.14715420675632612], ["stimulant", 0.14715420675632612], ["sink", 0.14715420675632612], ["waist", 0.13556948938180716], ["pulling", 0.12735000159747056], ["brandy", 0.1209744715599217], ["gasped", 0.1209744715599217], ["mustache", 0.11576528422295156], ["rolled", 0.1113609790850299], ["darling", 0.1113609790850299], ["murmured", 0.10418056684843259], ["um", 0.10418056684843259], ["peckham", 0.09596107906409598], ["caught", 0.08958554902654713], ["dear", 0.08774159127975939], ["floor", 0.08774159127975939], ["box", 0.084376361689577], ["started", 0.07997205655165533], ["heart", 0.0761568739052404], ["best", 0.07499053120466168], ["matter", 0.06884449178703467], ["making", 0.06537703872976988], ["wife", 0.053521500099406795], ["hand", 0.05298743915620243], ["eyes", 0.049040286628179094]], "sentiment": ["\u201cUm,\u201d said Hurty.\n\u201cHave you a labyrinth?\u201d said Mrs. Peckham.\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d said Hurty.\n\u201cA labyrinth made of box hedge.

aunts.\u201d This was true. \u201cPerhaps you haven\u2019t noticed, Harry, but the Pontiac has now become a glamorous, youthful adventure for people who want a kick out of life! And you dress and act like this was a mortuary! Look at yourself in a mirror, Harry, and ask yourself, \u2018Who could ever associate a man like this with a Pontiac?\u2019\u201d\nHarry LeSabre was too choked up to point out to Dwayne that, no matter what he looked like, he was generally acknowledged to be one of the most effective sales managers for Pontiac not only in the State, but in the entire Middle West. Pontiac was the best-selling automobile in the Midland City area, despite the fact that it was not a low-price car. It was a medium-price car.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDwayne Hoover told poor Harry LeSabre that the Hawaiian Festival, only a long weekend away, was Harry\u2019s golden opportunity to loosen up, to have some fun, to encourage other people to have some fun, too.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Dwayne. \u201cI have some news for you: modern science has given us a whole lot of wonderful new colors, with strange, exciting names like red!, orange!, green!, and pink!, Harry. We\u2019re not stuck any more with just black, gray and white! Isn\u2019t that good news, Harry? And the State Legislature has just announced that it is no longer a crime to smile during working hours, Harry, and I have the personal promise of the Governor that never again will anybody be sent to the Sexual Offenders\u2019 Wing of the Adult Correctional Institution for telling a joke!\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHarry LeSabre might have weathered all this with only minor damage, if only Harry hadn\u2019t been a secret transvestite. On weekends he liked to dress up in women\u2019s clothing, and not drab clothing, either. Harry and his wife would pull down the window blinds, and Harry would turn into a bird of paradise.\nNobody but Harry\u2019s wife knew his secret.\nWhen Dwayne razzed him about the clothes he wore to work, and then mentioned the Sexual Offenders\u2019 Wing of the Adult Correctional Institution at Shepherdstown, Harry had to suspect that his secret was out. And it wasn\u2019t merely a comical secret, either. Harry could be arrested for what he did on weekends.
