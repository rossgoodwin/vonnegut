The woman was from St. Louis. Her husband was a brewmaster in the Anheuser-Busch Division of RAMJAC. They had come to Nicaragua for a second honeymoon on the advice of a travel agent. The husband had died that morning of amoebic dysentery.\nSo Mary Kathleen took her back to the hotel and put her into one of the many unused suites she had, and told some of her Mormons to arrange to have the body and the widow flown to St. Louis on a RAMJAC plane.\nWhen Mary Kathleen went to tell her about the arrangements, she found the woman strangled with a cord from the draperies. This was the really horrible part, though: Whoever had done it had obviously believed the woman was Mary Kathleen. Her hands were cut off. They were never found.\nMary Kathleen went to New York City soon after that. She began to watch shopping-bag ladies through field glasses from her suite in the Waldorf Towers. General of the Armies Douglas MacArthur lived on the floor above her, incidentally.\nShe never went out, never had visitors, never called anyone. No hotel people were allowed in. The Mormons brought the food from downstairs, and made the beds, and did all the cleaning. But one day she received a threatening note, anyway. It was in a pink, scented envelope atop her most intimate lingerie. It said that the author knew who she was and held her responsible for the overthrow of the legitimate government of Guatemala. He was going to blow up the hotel.\nMary Kathleen could take no more. She walked out on her Mormons, who were surely loyal, but unable to protect her. She began to protect herself with layers and layers of clothing she found in garbage cans.\n\u201cIf your money made you so unhappy,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you give it away?\u201d\n\u201cI am!\u201d she said. \u201cAfter I die, you look in my left shoe, Walter.

All that remained to be done for the trip out was to press the on button. The upside-down ship would then blunder against the cave floor, give up, retreat from the floor under the impression that the floor was a ceiling.\nIt would go up the system of chimneys under the impression that it was going down. And it would inevitably find the way out, under the impression that it was seeking the deepest possible hole.\nThe hole it would eventually find itself in would be the bottomless, sideless pit of space eternal.\nBoaz came into the upside-down ship, his arms loaded with dead harmoniums. He was carrying four quarts or more of the seeming dried apricots. Inevitably he dropped some. And, in stooping to pick them up reverently, he dropped more.\nTears were streaming down his face.\n\"You see?\" said Boaz. He was raging heartbrokenly against himself \"You see, Unk?\" he said. \"See what happens when somebody just runs off and forgets?\"\nBoaz shook his head. \"This ain\u2019t all of \u2019em,\" he said. \"This ain\u2019t near all of \u2019em.\" He found an empty carton that had once contained candy bars.

"sentiment": ["What the machines couldn\u2019t guess was that Edgar\u2019s second extramarital affair, the deep one, was with a widow named Marion Frascati, that it was still going on, and that Marion\u2019s deceased husband had been Lou Frascati, a second-coater first class, Edgar\u2019s best friend. To their own profound shock, Edgar and Marion had found themselves in each other\u2019s arms a scant month after good old Lou\u2019s death. And again, and again, and again\u2014and they\u2019d tried to bring it to an end, honest-to-God they had. But it was like a bright, fat cherry on the gray mush of their lives. And they thought, wistfully, weakly, that maybe it wouldn\u2019t really matter as long as no one was hurt\u2014the kids; sweet, loyal Wanda. And that Lou wouldn\u2019t have wanted anything more, now that he had another variety of bliss, than that good old Edgar and good old Marion make the most of life while they had the use of their flesh.\nBut they hadn\u2019t believed it. And the kids noticed something screwy was going on, and Wanda\u2019d cried a couple of times lately and refused to tell him why, and probably Lou, wherever he was\u2026. Anyway, Edgar was going to go on seeing Marion, but he was going to tell Wanda, God bless her and God help her\u2014tell her, and\u2014Who was banging on the Hagstrohm door but the goddam Shah of Bratpuhr, for chris-sakes.\n\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d said Edgar, and he added under his breath, \u201cyour majesty, your highness, emperor of the universe and all the ships at sea, you nosy son-of-a-bitch.\u201d\nWhen Halyard had phoned him about the visit, Hagstrohm had made a point of not being impressed by the Shah\u2019s title, or by Halyard\u2019s rank. It was rare that he got the opportunity to show what he thought of rank\u2014that a man was a man for all that. He was going to behave perfectly naturally, just as he would if the callers had been fellow Reeks and Wrecks. Wanda had taken a different view, and had started frantically to clean the place from top to bottom, and to make lemonade and send Edgar, Jr., out for little cookies, but big Edgar had put a stop to all that. He put the kids out, and that was the only cleaning up that was to be done.\nThe door opened, and in came the Shah, followed by Khashdrahr, Halyard, and Doctor Ned Dodge, the manager of Proteus Park.\n\u201cAha!\u201d said the Shah, gingerly touching the enameled steel wall of the living room. \u201cMmmmm.\u201d\nEdgar held out his hand, and the parade brushed past it, heedless. \u201cWell, kiss mine,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cEh?\u201d said Doctor Dodge.\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in a saloon now, Hagstrohm,\u201d whispered Dodge. \u201cWatch yourself; this is

He thought he was on the virgin planet promised by the book by Kilgore Trout. Even when he was laid out horizontally by Cyprian Ukwende and Khashdrahr Miasma, he thought he was standing up. The book had told him that he went swimming in cold water on the virgin planet, that he always yelled something surprising when he climbed out of the icy pool. It was a game. The Creator of the Universe would try to guess what Dwayne would yell each day. And Dwayne would fool him totally.\nHere is what Dwayne yelled in the ambulance: \u201cGoodbye, Blue Monday!\u201d Then it seemed to him that another day had passed on the virgin planet, and it was time to yell again. \u201cNot a cough in a carload!\u201d he yelled.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nKilgore Trout was one of the walking wounded. He was able to climb aboard Martha without assistance, and to choose a place to sit where he would be away from real emergencies. He had jumped Dwayne Hoover from behind when Dwayne dragged Francine Pefko out of Dwayne\u2019s showroom and onto the asphalt. Dwayne wanted to give her a beating in public, which his bad chemicals made him think she richly deserved.\nDwayne had already broken her jaw and three ribs in the office. When he trundled her outside, there was a fairsize crowd which had drifted out of the cocktail lounge and the kitchen of the new Holiday Inn. \u201cBest fucking machine in the State,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cWind her up, and she\u2019ll fuck you and say she loves you, and she won\u2019t shut up till you give her a Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.\u201d\nAnd so on. Trout grabbed him from behind.\nTrout\u2019s right ring finger somehow slipped into Dwayne\u2019s mouth, and Dwayne bit off the topmost joint. Dwayne let go of Francine after that, and she slumped to the asphalt. She was unconscious, and the most seriously injured of all. And Dwayne went cantering over to the concrete trough by the Interstate, and he spat Kilgore Trout\u2019s fingertip into Sugar Creek.", -0.07731524427953], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["boyle", 0.1985424536220828], ["commodore", 0.17180634469461253], ["robert", 0.1527669415942449], ["reuther", 0.10771841656329481], ["swimming", 0.10771841656329481], ["stevenson", 0.0992712268110414], ["remind", 0.0992712268110414], ["sir", 0.08858173155478036], ["kennedy", 0.06717862179130912], ["board", 0.06313370482378919], ["trunks", 0.061079491412480175], ["deck", 0.061079491412480175], ["violently", 0.061079491412480175], ["evidence", 0.061079491412480175], ["purposefulness", 0.061079491412480175], ["nautical", 0.061079491412480175], ["dagger", 0.061079491412480175], ["views", 0.061079491412480175], ["beaten", 0.061079491412480175], ["seacocks", 0.061079491412480175], ["vicinity", 0.061079491412480175], ["slight", 0.061079491412480175], ["truncheons", 0.061079491412480175], ["repelled", 0.061079491412480175], ["swarmed", 0.061079491412480175], ["unoccupied", 0.061079491412480175], ["chimpanzee", 0.061079491412480175], ["boarder", 0.061079491412480175], ["rope", 0.061079491412480175], ["unannounced", 0.061079491412480175], ["anchor", 0.061079491412480175], ["insensible", 0.061079491412480175], ["smashing", 0.053859208281647405], ["uninvited", 0.053859208281647405], ["swimmer", 0.053859208281647405], ["policy", 0.053859208281647405], ["stinkpot", 0.053859208281647405], ["walter", 0.053859208281647405], ["fatigue", 0.053859208281647405], ["political", 0.053859208281647405], ["term", 0.053859208281647405], ["developing", 0.053859208281647405], ["honored", 0.0496356134055207], ["proper", 0.0496356134055207], ["wears", 0.0496356134055207], ["opening", 0.0496356134055207], ["cutting", 0.0496356134055207], ["adlai", 0.0496356134055207], ["shooting", 0.04663892515081465], ["costs", 0.04663892515081465], ["object", 0.04663892515081465], ["demanded", 0.0443145131579583], ["speed", 0.0443145131579583], ["goldwater", 0.04241533027468794], ["marlin", 0.04241533027468794], ["button", 0.03941864201998188], ["edge", 0.03819173539856122], ["hit", 0.03819173539856122], ["persons", 0.03709423002712553], ["moving", 0.03610141565416382], ["teeth", 0.03519504714385517], ["president", 0.03358931089565456], ["funny", 0.03358931089565456], ["turned", 0.033353152053266284], ["order", 0.029873946896292775], ["hope", 0.029365716019527855], ["son", 0.02318796891533033], ["feet", 0.02318796891533033], ["matter", 0.02265366376546001], ["time", 0.021736450208188752], ["voice", 0.021426757144039344], ["heard", 0.020754480882189646], ["wanted", 0.020329251772603654], ["men", 0.018257888660674848], ["asked", 0.01792183801256838]], "sentiment": ["\"There has been no shooting, and no smashing, sir,\" said Boyle. \"There has also been no evidence of swimmer\u2019s fatigue.

The criminals called me \u201cThe Preacher\u201d or \u201cThe Professor,\u201d just as they had on the other side.\nI saw that many of them had tied ribbons around their upper arms as a sort of uniform. So when I came across a man who wasn\u2019t wearing a ribbon, I asked him jokingly, \u201cWhere\u2019s your uniform, Soldier?\u201d\n\u201cPreacher,\u201d he said, referring to his skin, \u201cI was born in a uniform.\u201d\nALTON DARWIN HAD set himself up in Tex Johnson\u2019s office in Samoza Hall as President of a new nation. He had been drinking. I do not mean to present any of these escapees as rational or capable of redemption. They did not care if they lived or died. Alton Darwin was glad to see me. Then again, he was glad about everything.\nI had to advise him, nonetheless, that he could expect to be bombed unless he and the rest of them got out of town right away. I said their best chance to survive was to go back to the prison and fly white flags everywhere. If they did that right away, they might claim that they had nothing to do with all the killings here. The number of people the escapees killed in Scipio, incidentally, was 5 less than the number I myself had killed single-handedly in the war in Vietnam.\nSo the Battle of Scipio was nothing but a \u201ctempest in a tea-pot,\u201d an expression the Atheist\u2019s Bible tells us is proverbial.\nI TOLD ALTON Darwin that if he and his people didn\u2019t want to be bombed and didn\u2019t want to return to the prison, they should take whatever food they could find and disperse to the north or west. I told him one thing he already knew, that the floor of the National Forest to the south and east was so dark and lifeless that anyone going in there would probably starve to death or go mad before he found his way back out of there.

"sentiment": ["Mother had been bounced off the board of directors of the center, for her disruptive behavior at meetings, and for her unfriendly comments on the center in the press and before church groups and garden clubs and so on. She was much in demand as a sparkling, prickly public speaker. Fred T. Barry, for his part, had become as silent as the center itself. I saw his Lincoln limousine a couple of times, but the back windows were opaque, so I have no idea whether he was in there or not. I would see his company jet parked out at the airport sometimes, but never him. I expected to hear news of Mr. Barry from time to time, as in the past, from employees of his who happened into the drugstore. But then it became evident that Mr. Barry\u2019s employees were boycotting Schramm\u2019s Drugstore, both night and day, because my mother\u2019s younger son was an employee there.\nSo it was a surprise that Mother now found herself talking on the telephone to none other than Fred T. Barry. He hoped, with all possible courtliness, that Mother would be home during the next hour, and willing to receive him. He had never been in our little shitbox before. I doubt, in fact, that he had ever before been in Avondale.\nMother told him to come ahead. Those were her exact words, delivered in the flat tones of someone who had never lost a fight: \u201cCome ahead, if you want to.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMother and I had not yet begun to speculate seriously about what the radioactive mantelpiece might have done to our health, nor had we been encouraged to do so. Nor would we ever be encouraged to do so. Ulm, the director of civil defense and car-wash tycoon, had been getting advice on our case over the telephone from somebody at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington, D.C., to the effect that the most important thing was that nobody panic. In order to prevent panic, the workmen who had torn out our fireplace, wearing protective clothing provided by Ulm, had been sworn to secrecy\u2014in the name of patriotism, of national security.\nThe cover story, provided by Washington, D.C., and spread throughout Avondale while Mother and I were staying at the new Holiday Inn, was that our house had been riddled by termites, and that the protective clothing was necessary, since the workmen had killed the insects with cyanide.\nInsects.\nSo we did not panic. Good citizens don\u2019t. We waited calmly for Fred T. Barry. I was at the picture window, peering out at the street between slats of the Venetian blinds. Mother was reclining in the Barcalounger my brother Felix had given her three Christmases ago. She was vibrating almost imperceptibly, and a reassuring drone came from underneath her. She had the massage motor turned on low.\nMother said that she didn\u2019t feel any different, now that she knew she had been exposed to radioactivity. \u201cDo you feel any different?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.
