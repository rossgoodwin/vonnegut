These programs featured highly regarded writers and playwrights such as Gore Vidal, Horton Foote, and Paddy Chayefsky, top directors like Sidney Lumet and George Roy Hill (who later directed the movie of Slaughterhouse-Five), and famous actors\u2014Robert Redford got his first leading role on Playhouse 90. These hour or ninety-minute programs contributed to the reputation of the 1950s as the \u201cGolden Age of Television.\u201d\nDear Knox:\nTell me: have things improved or deteriorated?\nAbout a month back I worked up a theory to the effect that women don\u2019t like screwing as a rhapsody of see, feel, hear, touch, and taste\u2014but they do like the power their attractiveness as targets for screwing gives them. A couple of years ago I worked up another theory, about compassion and bad conscience, I think it was. And a close friend remarked that the theory had everything but originality. And so it is with this one. I\u2019ve also come to think that this one also lacks validity, and that women are damn moody things. A bundle of contradictory theories is called for. God knows that lacks originality, which is one of the very tough things about being in the writing game, eh?\nAnyway\u2014I worked a little at this one, and actually got around to juxtaposing two very fancy things. One was Freud\u2019s statement that, damn near on his deathbed, he still didn\u2019t know what women wanted, and his statement about Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, in effect: \u201cI should know women so good.\u201d The other was the Molly Bloom part of Ulysses.\nI now need a key. The key is what women think of the Molly Bloom part of Ulysses. I can\u2019t even get my own wife to read it. And it\u2019s no more a subject for mixed conversation than the Hottentot apron. Still I\u2019d like to know\u2014and it\u2019s just the kind of thing Leopold Bloom went around in his carpet slippers wanting to know.\nAnd isn\u2019t that the balls of a book?

I said nothing, no matter what was said to me. Sometimes I sat bolt upright. Sometimes I bent over, with my head down and my inky hands over my inky ears or eyes. Toward the end, my bladder was full to bursting. I peed in my pants rather than speak. Why not? I was a geek. I was a wild man from Borneo.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI have since determined, from talking to old, old people, that I was the only Midland City criminal to have been put on public display since the days of public hangings on the courthouse lawn. My punishment was more than cruel and unusual. It was unique. But it made sense to just about everybody\u2014with the exception of the Maritimo brothers, as I have said, and, surprisingly, George Metzger, the city editor of the Bugle-Observer, the husband of the woman I had killed that afternoon.\nBefore George Metzger arrived, though, members of my audience behaved as though they were quite accustomed to taunting bad people. They may have done a lot of it in their dreams. They clearly felt entitled to respectful attention from me.\nSo I heard a lot of things like \u201cHey you\u2014it\u2019s you I\u2019m talking to. Yes you!\u201d and \u201cGod damn it, you look me in the eye, you son of a bitch,\u201d and so on.\nI was told about friends or relatives who had been hurt or killed in the war. Some of the casualties were victims of industrial accidents right there at home. The moral arithmetic was simple. Here all those soldiers and sailors and workers in war plants were risking their all to add more goodness to the world, whereas I had just subtracted some.\nWhat was my own opinion of myself? I thought I was a defective human being, and that I shouldn\u2019t even be on this planet anymore. Anybody who would fire a Springfield .30-06 over the rooftops of a city had to have a screw loose.\nIf I had begun to reply to the people, I think that\u2019s what I would have babbled over and over again: \u201cI have a screw loose somewhere, I have a screw loose somewhere, I have a screw loose somewhere.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nCelia Hildreth came by the cage. I hadn\u2019t seen her for a year, since the awful night of the senior prom, but I had no trouble recognizing her. She was still the most beautiful woman in town. I can\u2019t imagine that the police had seen fit to invite her. It was her escort, surely, who had been invited.

big time! Magda found herself pregnant, and the rest is history. Berman: \u201cImagine how my father felt, only twenty-two, in his first year of dental school. How would you feel if you stuck your dingdong into a woman, with the best of intentions, and she exploded?\u201d Or, conversely, one might wish to ask: \u201cHow would you like it if, through no fault of your own, you were booby-trapped protoplasm? Or her son?\u201d\nGil Berman on the subject of his birth, which ruined the lives of both his parents: \u201cWhen the doctor dangled me upside down and spanked my butt to start my breathing, I didn\u2019t cry. I said, \u2018A funny thing happened on the way down the birth canal. A bum came up to me and said he hadn\u2019t had a bite for two days. So I bit him.\u2019\u201d\nAfter the booby trap went off, Magda and Bob Berman, one has to say, both behaved honorably and resourcefully within the strict existential limits Fate had set for them. As luck would have it, those limits, according to Berman, were \u201cmore like inner tubes stretched between fence posts than like barbed-wire such as once ringed Auschwitz and Alcatraz, because they had plenty of money. Money is dehydrated mercy. If you have plenty of it, you just add tears, and people come out of the woodwork to comfort you.\u201d\nYes, and each of his parents made the most of such momentum as he or she had been maintaining before, and again, shit hit the fan. His mother continued to play the piano for hours every day, and she took up making artistic scrapbooks of current events, and she was a queen bee in a hive of doctor and lawyer bees, and nurse and hairdresser bees, and a nanny bee and then a tutor-and-companion bee for her child, and on and on. And there was already a gymnasium in the basement, and an aerobics instructor bee to make her and her child stay in shape. One odd rule she made\u2014and she got a lot of what she asked for\u2014was that although her son could sit next to her on the piano bench while she played\u2014she liked that\u2014he was never ever to touch the keys. If he reached for the keyboard when he was very little, she would grab his wrist and say, \u201cNo, no, no, Gilly-willy. Gilly-willy be very unhappy if he touch the keys. Gilly-willy-woo cry and cry all night like Mama.\u201d That sort of thing, as though the Steinway grand were, in Berman\u2019s words, \u201ca red-hot, potbellied, cast-iron stove in a hick-town hardware store.\u201d\nAlso, if he made any friends in the outside world, he wasn\u2019t to bring them home with him. A former kindergarten teacher would recall him as having been \u201ca rather unusual child.\u201d She was unable to be more specific than that. She was eighty years old.\nIt is Gil Berman who is responsible for the analogy above: a childhood home like a beehive. It must have surely occurred to his dad as well. \u201cAnyone preparing for a career in the healing arts,\u201d he said, \u201cis bound to have heard about the lives of social insects at some point in his or her education, as the case may be. I don\u2019t see how Dad could not have thought of Mother as a queen bee surrounded by workers. So fucking obvious! That would make him a drone. As a drone he had done all a drone was supposed to do, which was knock up the queen. But he was not a bee, and so he stayed in dental school at Boston University, to which he had just been admitted. What else was he supposed to do?\n\u201cHe asked his gaga wife if he could borrow her Mercedes to drive to and from BU, since she was never going to drive again, and there were four other cars. She said, \u2018You\u2019ll have to ask my lawyer.\u2019 So he did. The lawyer said he could. That was the last time he asked his wife for anything. If there was something he really needed, like money for gas or lunch, he asked her lawyer.\u201d\nHe asked the lawyer, \u201cHow about tuition? Should my parents keep paying that? They will if they have to.\u201d Berman: \u201cHe was just a kid, you realize, only twenty-three years old when the excrement hit the air-conditioning. He felt he had done terrible damage with his dingdong, and he had had zero opportunity to establish himself as head or even co-head of a biological family. At least Bob Berman could become an orthodontist instead of sitting around the beehive with his thumb up his ass. Could he actually ask for money?\u201d\nBob Berman\u2019s strikingly specific boyhood dream of becoming an orthodontist formed on a golf course when he was only a caddy, had been about money, and lots of time for golf, and being a doctor, but a kind of doctor whose patients weren\u2019t sick, who could never up and croak on him. But in defending his career choice against funsters since the eighth grade, Gil Berman\u2019s dad had become, in Gil Berman\u2019s words, \u201coperatically arioso on the subject of how important smiles were, and what meticulous planning and patience and surgical skills it took to fix one.\u201d A professor of his at BU Dental likened orthodontics to \u201ccivil engineering in a teacup.\u201d Gil Berman\u2019s dad loved hearing that. It was the truth.\nGill Berman: \u201cThe only proof my dad needed of the existence of God was a birdie or an overbite. And after he bought another man\u2019s practice in Boston with Mom\u2019s money, he started chasing women with his own money. Why not? He was warm and beautiful.

So it goes. And his new overcoat was thawed out and limp now. It was much too small for Billy. It had a fur collar and a lining of crimson silk, and had apparently been made for an impresario about as big as an organ-grinder\u2019s monkey. It was full of bullet holes.\nBilly Pilgrim dressed himself. He put on the little overcoat, too. It split up the back, and, at the shoulders, the sleeves came entirely free. So the coat became a fur-collared vest. It was meant to flare at its owner\u2019s waist, but the flaring took place at Billy\u2019s armpits. The Germans found him to be one of the most screamingly funny things they had seen in all of World War Two. They laughed and laughed.\nAnd the Germans told everybody else to form in ranks of five, with Billy as their pivot. Then out of doors went the parade, and through gate after gate again. There were more starving Russians with faces like radium dials. The Americans were livelier than before. The jazzing with hot water had cheered them up. And they came to a shed where a corporal with only one arm and one eye wrote the name and serial number of each prisoner in a big, red ledger. Everybody was legally alive now. Before they got their names and numbers in that book, they were missing in action and probably dead.\nSo it goes.\nAs the Americans were waiting to move on, an altercation broke out in their rear-most rank. An American had muttered something which a guard did not like. The guard knew English, and he hauled the American out of ranks, knocked him down.\nThe American was astonished. He stood up shakily, spitting blood. He\u2019d had two teeth knocked out. He had meant no harm by what he\u2019d said, evidently, had no idea that the guard would hear and understand.\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d he asked the guard.\nThe guard shoved him back into ranks. \u201cVy you? Vy anybody?\u201d he said.\nWhen Billy Pilgrim\u2019s name was inscribed in the ledger of the prison camp, he was given a number, too, and an iron dogtag in which that number was stamped. A slave laborer from Poland had done the stamping. He was dead now. So it goes.\nBilly was told to hang the tag around his neck along with his American dogtags, which he did. The tag was like a salt cracker, perforated down its middle so that a strong man could snap it in two with his bare hands. In case Billy died, which he didn\u2019t, half of the tag would mark his body and half would mark his grave.", 0.02815375982042647], "title": "Slaughterhouse-Five"}, "the-sirens-of-titan": {"tfidf": [["visitor", 0.17352895510644506], ["elco", 0.12116197586452143], ["hoist", 0.12116197586452143], ["novelty", 0.11119152238645182], ["indiana", 0.10411737306386704], ["noel", 0.10017873797559389], ["bureau", 0.09414691958579742], ["young", 0.08582132545495853], ["suppose", 0.06941158204257804], ["week", 0.06941158204257804], ["job", 0.06575349103742706], ["revenue", 0.06575349103742706], ["owned", 0.06575349103742706], ["internal", 0.06575349103742706], ["company", 0.0590538944471053], ["government", 0.058048513508808436], ["secret", 0.05282796053965212], ["top", 0.047743453518277704], ["poppers", 0.04606885955505861], ["tire", 0.04606885955505861], ["remotest", 0.04606885955505861], ["hoists", 0.04606885955505861], ["listening", 0.04606885955505861], ["blankly", 0.04606885955505861], ["resigned", 0.04606885955505861], ["manufactures", 0.04606885955505861], ["allied", 0.04606885955505861], ["patents", 0.04606885955505861], ["stuffily", 0.04606885955505861], ["customer", 0.04606885955505861], ["developing", 0.04606885955505861], ["recapping", 0.04606885955505861], ["whiskers", 0.04606885955505861], ["lifting", 0.04606885955505861], ["hats", 0.04038732528817381], ["underwater", 0.04038732528817381], ["laboratory", 0.04038732528817381], ["reaction", 0.04038732528817381], ["manufacture", 0.04038732528817381], ["holds", 0.04038732528817381], ["curiosity", 0.04038732528817381], ["gather", 0.04038732528817381], ["machinery", 0.04038732528817381], ["dollar", 0.03706384079548394], ["articles", 0.03706384079548394], ["nose", 0.03706384079548394], ["curtly", 0.03706384079548394], ["products", 0.03706384079548394], ["cent", 0.03706384079548394], ["detail", 0.03706384079548394], ["war", 0.03638038498450811], ["gear", 0.03470579102128902], ["cat", 0.03470579102128902], ["shrewd", 0.03470579102128902], ["describe", 0.03287674551871353], ["enterprise", 0.03287674551871353], ["changed", 0.03138230652859914], ["months", 0.03138230652859914], ["longer", 0.03138230652859914], ["paper", 0.03011877636608063], ["fourteen", 0.03011877636608063], ["key", 0.03011877636608063], ["period", 0.03011877636608063], ["instance", 0.03011877636608063], ["constant", 0.02927911629523966], ["morning", 0.029024256754404218], ["investment", 0.029024256754404218], ["learned", 0.029024256754404218], ["smile", 0.02805882203590927], ["answer", 0.02805882203590927], ["party", 0.02805882203590927], ["sold", 0.02641398026982606], ["questions", 0.02570077226171434], ["work", 0.025044684493898472], ["money", 0.02443724209919583], ["private", 0.023871726759138852], ["idea", 0.023871726759138852], ["business", 0.022377287769024472], ["simply", 0.022377287769024472], ["dollars", 0.02111375760650596], ["fifty", 0.020019237994829544], ["inside", 0.020019237994829544], ["making", 0.0190538032763346], ["order", 0.016471171746499393], ["things", 0.012929095064611474], ["three", 0.01025371322336171]], "sentiment": ["\"I think so,\" said the young visitor. \"Don\u2019t you think so?

parents did\u2014\u2019\u201d\nEt cetera.\n\u2013NOBLE CLAGGETT\n(1947\u20131966)\nSome students would ask permission to write about some other Gal\u00e1pagos Islands creature, and Mary, being such a good teacher, would of course answer, \u201cYes.\u201d And the favorite alternates were those teasers and robbers of the boobies, the great frigate birds. These James Waits of the bird world survived on fish which boobies caught, and got their nesting materials from nests which boobies built. A certain sort of student found this hilarious, and such a student was almost invariably male.\nAnd a unique physical feature of male great frigate birds was also bound to attract the attention of immature human males concerned with erectile performances of their own sex organs. Each male great frigate bird at mating time tried to attract the attention of females by inflating a bright red balloon at the base of his throat. At mating time, a typical rookery when viewed from the air resembled an enormous party for human children, at which every child had received a red balloon. The island would in fact be paved with male great frigate birds with their heads tilted back, their qualifications as husbands inflated by their lungs to the bursting point\u2014while, overhead, the females wheeled.\nOne by one the females would drop from the sky, having chosen this or that red balloon.\nAfter Mary Hepburn showed her film about the great frigate birds, and the windowshades in the classroom were raised and the lights turned back on, some student, again almost invariably a male, was sure to ask, sometimes clinically, sometimes as a comedian, sometimes bitterly, hating and fearing women: \u201cDo the females always try to pick the biggest ones?\u201d\nSo Mary was ready with a reply as consistent, word by word, as any quotation known by Mandarax: \u201cTo answer that, we would have to interview female great frigate birds, and no one has done that yet, so far as I know. Some people have devoted their lives to studying them, though, and it is their opinion that the females are in fact choosing the red balloons which mark the best nesting sites. That makes sense in terms of survival, you see.\n\u201cAnd that brings us back to the really deep mystery of the blue-footed boobies\u2019 courtship dance, which seems to have absolutely no connection with the elements of booby survival, with nesting or fish. What does it have to do with, then? Dare we call it \u2018religion\u2019? Or, if we lack that sort of courage, might we at least call it \u2018art\u2019?", 0.20108225108225106], "title": "Galapagos"}, "bluebeard": {"tfidf": [["ding", 0.19447375688606094], ["winds",

misinformed.\u201d\nI happened to see in The New York Times the other day a picture of a French Empire escritoire which was auctioned off to a Kuwaiti for three quarters of a million dollars, and I am almost certain it was in Gregory\u2019s guest room back in 1933.\nThere were two anachronisms in that room, both pictures by Gregory. Over the fireplace was his illustration of the moment in Robinson Crusoe when the castaway narrator sees a human footprint on the beach of the island of which he had believed himself to be the sole resident. Over the escritoire was his illustration of the moment when Robin Hood and Little John, strangers who are about to become the best of friends, meet in the middle of a log crossing a stream, each armed with a quarterstaff, and neither one of them willing to back up so that the other one can get to where he would very much like to be.\nRobin Hood winds up in the drink, of course.\n11\nI FELL ASLEEP on the floor of that room. I certainly wasn\u2019t going to muss the bed or disturb anything. I dreamed I was back on the train, with its clickety-clack, clickety-clack, ding-ding-ding and whoo-ah. The ding-ding-ding wasn\u2019t coming from the train, of course, but from signals at crossings, where anybody who didn\u2019t give us the right-of-way would be ripped to smithereens. Serve \u2018em right! They were nothing. We were everything.\nA lot of the people who had to stop for us or be killed were farmers and their families, with all their possessions tied every which way on broken-down trucks. Windstorms or banks had taken away their farms, just as surely as the United States Cavalry had taken the same land from the Indians in their grandfathers\u2019 time. The farms that were whisked away by the winds: where are they now? Growing fish food on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico.\nThese defeated white Indians at the crossings were nothing new to me.

I was waiting for the bus. I had beside me a tan canvas-and-leather suitcase designed for Army officers. It had been my constant companion in Europe during my glory days. Draped over it was an old trenchcoat, also from my glory days. I was all alone. The bus was late. Every so often I would pat the pockets of my suitcoat, making sure that I had my release papers, my government voucher for a one-way, tourist-class flight from Atlanta to New York City, my money, and my Doctor of Mixology degree. The sun beat down on me.\nI had three hundred and twelve dollars and eleven cents. Two hundred and fifty of that was in the form of a government check, which could not easily be stolen from me. It was all my own money. After all the meticulous adding and subtracting that had gone on relative to my assets since my arrest, that much, to the penny, was incontrovertibly mine: three hundred and twelve dollars and eleven cents.\nSo here I was going out into the Free Enterprise System again. Here I was cut loose from the protection and nurture of the federal government again.\nThe last time this had happened to me was in Nineteen-hundred and Fifty-three, two years after Leland Clewes went to prison for perjury. Dozens of other witnesses had been found to testify against him by then\u2014and more damagingly, too. All I had ever accused him of was membership in the Communist Party before the war, which I would have thought was about as damning for a member of the Depression generation as having stood in a breadline. But others were willing to swear that Clewes had continued to be a communist throughout the war, and had passed secret information to agents of the Soviet Union. I was flabbergasted.\nThat was certainly news to me, and may not even have been true. The most I had wanted from Clewes was an admission that I had told the truth about something that really didn\u2019t matter much. God knows I did not want to see him ruined and sent to jail. And the most I expected for myself was that I would be sorry for the rest of my life, would never feel quite right about myself ever again, because of what I had accidentally done to him. Otherwise, I thought, life could be expected to go on much as before.\nTrue: I had been transferred to a less-sensitive job in the Defense Department, tabulating the likes and dislikes of soldiers of various major American races and religions, and from various educational and economic backgrounds, for various sorts of field rations, some of them new and experimental. Work of that sort, now done brainlessly and eyelessly and handlessly and at the speed of light by computers, was still being done largely by hand in those days. I and my staff now seem as archaic to me as Christian monks illuminating manuscripts with paintbrushes and gold leaf and quills.\nAnd true: People who dealt with me at work, both inferiors and superiors, became more formal, more coldly correct, when dealing with me. They had no time anymore, seemingly, for jokes, for stories about the war. Every conversation was schnip-schnap! Then it was time to get back to work. I ascribed this at the time, and even told my poor wife that I admired it, to the spirit of the new, lean, keen, highly mobile and thoroughly professional Armed Forces we were shaping. They were to be a thunderbolt with which we could vaporize any new, would-be Hitler; anywhere in the world. No sooner had the people of a country lost their freedom, than the United States of America would arrive to give it back again.\nAnd true: Ruth\u2019s and my social life was somewhat less vivid than the one I had promised her in Nuremberg. I had projected for her a telephone in our home that would never stop ringing, with old comrades of mine on the other end. They would want to eat and drink and talk all night. They would be in the primes of their lives in government service, in their late thirties or early forties, like me\u2014so able and experienced and diplomatic and clever, and at bottom as hard as nails, that they would be the real heads and the guts of their organizations, no matter where in the hierarchy they were supposed to be. I promised Ruth that they would be blowing in from big jobs in Moscow, in Tokyo, in her home town in Vienna, in Jakarta and Timbuktu, and God knows where. What tales they would have to tell us about the world, about what was really going on! We would laugh and have another drink, and so on.

His idea.\u201d He found himself awakened by a subject that interested him. Anita\u2019s hammering at the subject of Pittsburgh had tended to make him curl up tighter and tighter. Now he felt himself relaxing somewhat, straightening out like a man. Finnerty was a magical name again; Paul\u2019s feelings about him had swung a full circle. Morale and esprit de corps, which Paul hadn\u2019t felt in any undertaking for years, had sprung up between them in the course of the exhilarating humiliation of Checker Charley. Moreover\u2014Paul\u2019s thoughts were coming alive as though refreshed by a cool wind\u2014there was enchantment in what Finnerty had done, a thing almost as inconceivable and beautifully simple as suicide: he\u2019d quit.\n\u201cPaul \u2026\u201d\n\u201cHmmmm?\u201d\n\u201cYour father thought you\u2019d be manager of Pittsburgh someday. If he were alive, nothing would make him happier than to know you got the job.\u201d\n\u201cUmm hmmmm.\u201d He remembered how Anita, shortly after their marriage, had dug up a picture of his father from a trunk and had had it enlarged and framed as her first birthday present to him. The picture was over on his bureau now, where she had put it\u2014where he could see it the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night. She had never met Paul\u2019s father, and he hadn\u2019t said much about him to her; yet she\u2019d built up a kind of mythology about the man that could keep her talking knowingly for hours. The myth had it that Paul\u2019s father in his youth had been just as easygoing as Paul, and that the strength that got him to the top job in the economy came in the middle years of his life\u2014came in the years Paul was just beginning.\nKroner, too, kept alive the notion that Paul could be expected to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. This faith of Kroner\u2019s had had a lot to do with Paul\u2019s getting to be manager of Ilium; and now that faith might get him the managership of Pittsburgh. When Paul thought about his effortless rise in the hierarchy, he sometimes, as now, felt sheepish, like a charlatan. He could handle his assignments all right, but he didn\u2019t have what his father had, what Kroner had, what Shepherd had, what so many had: the sense of spiritual importance in what they were doing; the ability to be moved emotionally, almost like a lover, by the great omnipresent and omniscient spook, the corporate personality. In short, Paul missed what made his father aggressive and great: the capacity to really give a damn.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do about Shepherd?\u201d said Anita.", 0.2250721500721501], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["neon", 0.1030466742096795], ["streetlights", 0.1030466742096795], ["lolling", 0.1030466742096795], ["stunted", 0.1030466742096795], ["taxi", 0.09021061531042127], ["clinging", 0.09021061531042127], ["streetcar", 0.09021061531042127], ["jeweler", 0.09021061531042127], ["aching", 0.09021061531042127], ["abandoned", 0.09021061531042127], ["tracks", 0.09021061531042127], ["filthy", 0.09021061531042127], ["district", 0.09021061531042127], ["purposeful", 0.09021061531042127], ["wheels", 0.09021061531042127], ["darling", 0.0827020021973071], ["cheeks", 0.0827020021973071], ["grim", 0.0827020021973071], ["harve", 0.07896587116284226], ["driving", 0.07737455641116302], ["wet", 0.07737455641116302], ["fourteen", 0.07737455641116302], ["eat", 0.07737455641116302], ["signs", 0.07324226842386283], ["system", 0.07324226842386283], ["bar", 0.07324226842386283], ["faint", 0.06986594329804885], ["apart", 0.06986594329804885], ["crying", 0.06701130107902556], ["store", 0.06701130107902556], ["shoulder", 0.06701130107902556], ["wagon", 0.06701130107902556], ["beer", 0.0623573301849347], ["clock", 0.060406209524604584], ["caught", 0.060406209524604584], ["tears", 0.060406209524604584], ["fast", 0.058641206194894865], ["station", 0.05702988439879061], ["business", 0.05702988439879061], ["front", 0.05289759641149043], ["stopped", 0.047570150625346336], ["feel", 0.044193825499532366], ["ilium", 0.04271155313520762], ["claire", 0.0420126581725623], ["small", 0.040689344024744806], ["years", 0.035683967548079766], ["long", 0.035683967548079766], ["red", 0.03520294002209346], ["wasn", 0.0321459076080296], ["wife", 0.030235088418488286], ["head", 0.027853285125486557], ["going", 0.02574320624864919]], "sentiment": ["Harve\u2019s clinging, aching head was lolling on the shoulder of his wife of fourteen years.\nClaire\u2019s cheeks were wet with recent tears.

She didn\u2019t leave the Pavilion in great embarrassment. On the contrary! She gave me a little more room for my cuestick but was still practically on top of me.\nI was playing 8-ball head to head with the novelist Paul Slazinger, that year\u2019s Writer in Residence. He was dead broke and out of print, which is the only reason anybody ever became Writer in Residence at Tarkington. He was so old that he had actually been in World War II. He had won a Silver Star like me when I was only 3 years old!\nHe asked me who Kimberley was, and I said, and she got this on tape, too, \u201cPay no attention. She\u2019s just another member of the Ruling Class.\u201d\nSo the Board of Trustees would want to know what it was, exactly, that I had against the Ruling Class.\nI didn\u2019t say so back then, but I am perfectly happy to say now that the trouble with the Ruling Class was that too many of its members were nitwits like Kimberley.\nONE THEORY I had about her snooping was that she was titillated by my reputation as the campus John F. Kennedy as far as sex outside of marriage was concerned.\nIf President Kennedy up in Heaven ever made a list of all the women he had made love to, I am sure it would be 2 or 3 times as long as the one I am making down here in jail. Then again, he had the glamour of his office, and the full cooperation of the Secret Service and the White House Staff. None of the names on my list would mean anything to the general public, whereas many on his would belong to movie stars. He made love to Marilyn Monroe. I sure never did. She evidently expected to marry him and become First Lady, which was a joke to everybody but her.\nShe eventually committed suicide. She finally found life too embarrassing.\nI STILL HARDLY knew Kimberley when she appeared in the bel tower on Graduation Day. But she was chatty, as though we were old, old pals. She was still recording me, although what she already had on tape was enough to do me in.\nShe asked me if I thought the speech Paul Slazinger, the Writer in Residence, gave in Chapel had been a good one. This was probably the most anti-American speech I had ever heard He gave it right before Christmas vacation, and was never agair seen in Scipio. He had just won a so-called Genius Grant from the MacArthur Foundation, $50,000 a year for 5 years.

The child would suppose that the message was terrifically important, since somebody had gone to the trouble of writing it in letters so big.\nAnd then, pretending to be a child by the roadside, he read the message on the side of another truck. This was it:\n11\nDWAYNE HOOVER slept until ten at the new Holiday Inn. He was much refreshed. He had a Number Five Breakfast in the popular restaurant of the Inn, which was the Tally-Ho Room. The drapes were drawn at night. They were wide open now. They let the sunshine in.\nAt the next table, also alone, was Cyprian Ukwende, the Indaro, the Nigerian. He was reading the classified ads in the Midland City Bugle-Observer. He needed a cheap place to live. The Midland County General Hospital was footing his bills at the Inn while he looked around, and they were getting restless about that.", 0.18163636363636362], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "armageddon-in-retrospect": {"tfidf": [["boulevard", 0.10711175460992606], ["green", 0.08681825845193077], ["red", 0.08297562844834738], ["black", 0.0668715769969683], ["boy", 0.06329512527165872], ["needles", 0.06143449567913614], ["hills", 0.05560046534664457], ["armored", 0.05560046534664457], ["infantry", 0.05560046534664457], ["bright", 0.03690574615052571], ["braid", 0.035703918203308684], ["abreast", 0.035703918203308684], ["police", 0.035703918203308684], ["deadened", 0.035703918203308684], ["blanket", 0.035703918203308684], ["saluted", 0.035703918203308684], ["blinking", 0.035703918203308684], ["sidewalk", 0.035703918203308684], ["dense", 0.035703918203308684], ["surrounded", 0.035703918203308684], ["boughs", 0.035703918203308684], ["carpet", 0.035703918203308684], ["ades", 0.035703918203308684], ["lunches", 0.035703918203308684], ["parted", 0.035703918203308684], ["pinpoints", 0.035703918203308684], ["cluster", 0.035703918203308684], ["hmmmm", 0.035703918203308684], ["meaningless", 0.035703918203308684], ["floating", 0.035703918203308684], ["fa", 0.035703918203308684], ["infinite", 0.035703918203308684], ["colonnades", 0.035703918203308684], ["interrupted", 0.035703918203308684], ["pine", 0.03565378389168212], ["walked", 0.03565378389168212], ["man", 0.03391812939112651], ["corps", 0.03071724783956807], ["orange", 0.03071724783956807], ["lifted", 0.03071724783956807], ["salute", 0.03071724783956807], ["trunks", 0.03071724783956807], ["directly", 0.03071724783956807], ["sounds", 0.03071724783956807], ["overhead", 0.03071724783956807], ["sharply", 0.03071724783956807], ["plain", 0.03071724783956807], ["absently", 0.03071724783956807], ["engineers", 0.03071724783956807], ["centuries", 0.03071724783956807], ["ranks", 0.03071724783956807], ["soldiers", 0.030642176779909228], ["street", 0.0290418079294024], ["grade", 0.027800232673322284], ["nonsense", 0.027800232673322284], ["brave", 0.027800232673322284], ["artillery", 0.027800232673322284], ["roof", 0.027800232673322284], ["gentle", 0.027800232673322284], ["desolation", 0.027800232673322284], ["lined", 0.027800232673322284], ["busy", 0.02573057747582746], ["covered", 0.02573057747582746], ["brown", 0.02573057747582746], ["leave", 0.02573057747582746], ["pass", 0.02573057747582746], ["sun", 0.02573057747582746], ["military", 0.02573057747582746], ["stepped", 0.02573057747582746], ["play", 0.02573057747582746], ["medical", 0.02573057747582746], ["deserted", 0.02573057747582746], ["block", 0.02573057747582746], ["sentence", 0.024125228185797175], ["returned", 0.024125228185797175], ["thick", 0.024125228185797175], ["change", 0.024125228185797175], ["clean", 0.024125228185797175], ["fresh", 0.024125228185797175], ["seriously", 0.022813562309581672], ["fat", 0.022813562309581672], ["south", 0.02170456461298269], ["stretched", 0.02170456461298269], ["short", 0.02170456461298269], ["forget", 0.020743907112086846], ["blue", 0.020743907112086846], ["suddenly", 0.020743907112086846], ["birthday", 0.020743907112086846], ["miles", 0.019896547143335885], ["shrugged", 0.019896547143335885], ["arms", 0.019896547143335885], ["fine", 0.01913855782205656], ["today", 0.01913855782205656], ["remember", 0.01913855782205656], ["ground", 0.018452873075262857], ["forest", 0.018452873075262857], ["city", 0.01782689194584106], ["smiled", 0.01782689194584106], ["morning", 0.016221542655810772], ["began", 0.016221542655810772], ["thinking", 0.015757236748346233], ["young", 0.015757236748346233], ["cut", 0.015757236748346233], ["side", 0.015321088389954614], ["held", 0.014909876779595271], ["days", 0.0145209039647012], ["turned", 0.0145209039647012], ["things", 0.011234872292070158], ["people", 0.010125874595471176], ["eyes", 0.010125874595471176], ["going", 0.006617218434714801]], "sentiment": ["The boy shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it, and play with it when I get back.\u201d\nBlinking in the bright morning, the two walked down their deserted street, turned into a busy boulevard lined with brave new fa\u00e7ades. It was as though the world had suddenly become fresh and clean and whole again. The people didn\u2019t seem to know that desolation began a block on either side of the fine boulevard, and stretched for miles. The two, with lunches under their arms, walked toward the pine-covered hills to the south, toward which the boulevard lifted in a gentle grade.\nFour young soldiers came down the sidewalk abreast. The old man stepped into the street, out of their way. The boy saluted, and held his ground. The soldiers smiled, returned his salute, and parted their ranks to let him pass.\n\u201cArmored infantry,\u201d said the boy to the old man.\n\u201cHmmmm?\u201d said the old man absently, his eyes on the green hills. \u201cReally?

The centuries-old carpet of needles and green roof deadened the sounds floating up from the city. Infinite colonnades of thick brown trunks surrounded the old man and the boy. The sun, directly overhead, showed itself to them only as a cluster of bright pinpoints through the fat, dense blanket of needles and boughs above.\n\u201cHere?\u201d said the boy.", 0.05349424477331455], "title": "Armageddon In Retrospect"}}
