Leopard and for fiction for his novel Shadow Country.\nDear Peter\u2014\nI thank you for having your publisher send me On the River Styx. The title story was the only one I\u2019d read before, and \u201cTravelin Man\u201d is maybe the best story I\u2019ll ever read. You made me ponder yet again over this past Easter weekend, which we spent at the Hotel Alexander on Miami Beach, how much closer to Nature you have lived than have I. I was sitting on the balcony of our 16th floor suite at sunrise, and a big hawk flew past me, eight feet from the tip of my nose, with what was maybe a starling in its claws. Raptors love those garish hotels, of course, and nest on top of them. A cliff is a cliff, and in Florida men have to build them. But my point is that, in the Jungian nick of time, Nature came to me.\nYou made me marvel, too, at how easily you can climb inside black people. I already knew you could do that, but still don\u2019t know enough about your life to understand how you learned to do that. I found out something more about your life, anyway, but not that, from your dance on razor blades in \u201cLumumba Lives.\u201d No\u2014I am not taking the story as autobiography. I am saying that anybody is bound to reveal a lot about himself when he dances on razor blades. I myself avoid that exercise.\nThis much we have in common, incidentally: I too grew up in a house with the very best books and firearms.\nI once met Tennessee Williams in the steambath of a health club near here, and I broke his spirit by telling him how much I admired A Streetcar Named Desire and The Glass Menagerie. He wasn\u2019t writing that well any more. I run no risk of doing that to you by saying that a story you wrote thirty-two years ago is the best thing in this collection, which it probably isn\u2019t. You are a writer unlike Williams, of remarkable steadiness and authority no matter what age you happen to be. What a novelty! What a relief!\nCheers,\nKurt Vonnegut\nApril 23, 1989", 0.28888888888888886], "title": "Letters"}, "bagombo-snuff-box": {"tfidf": [["birthplace", 0.073044305212892], ["territorial",

jingoistic romance, amounts only to this: Human beings come into this world, for their own good, as instinctively territorial as timber wolves or honeybees. Not long ago, human beings who strayed too far from their birthplace and relatives, like all other animals, would be committing suicide.\nThis dread of not crossing well-understood geographical boundaries still makes sense in many parts of the world, in what used to be Yugoslavia in Europe, for example, or Rwanda in Africa. It is, however, now excess instinctual baggage in most of North America, thank God, thank God. It lives on in this country, as obsolescent survival instincts often do, as feelings and manners that are by and large harmless, that can even be comical.\nThus do I and millions like me tell strangers that we are Middle Westerners, as though we deserved some kind of a medal for being that. All I can say in our defense is that natives of Texas and Brooklyn are even more preposterous in their territorial vanity.\nNearly countless movies about Texans and Brooklynites are lessons for such people in how to behave ever more stereotypically. Why have there been no movies about supposedly typical Middle Western heroes, models to which we, too, might then conform?\nAll I\u2019ve got now is an aggressively nasal accent.\nAbout that accent: When I was in the Army during the Second World War, a white Southerner said to me, \u201cDo you have to talk that way?\u201d\nI might have replied, \u201cOh, yeah? At least my ancestors never owned slaves,\u201d but the training session at the rifle range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina seemed neither the time nor the place to settle his hash.\nI might have added that some of the greatest words ever spoken in American history were uttered with just such a Jew\u2019s-harp twang, including the Gettysburg Address of Abraham Lincoln of Illinois and these by Eugene V. Debs of Terre Haute, Indiana: \u201cWhile there is a lower class I am in it, while there is a criminal element I am of it; while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\u201d\nI would have kept to myself that the borders of Indiana, when I was a boy, cradled not only the birthplace of Eugene V. Debs, but the national headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan.\nIllinois had Carl Sandburg and Al Capone.", 0.15314900153609828], "title": "Bagombo Snuff Box"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["gramps", 0.16685059386716528], ["lou", 0.12847417236983658], ["paragraph", 0.07239050834071724], ["substituted", 0.06383313574121174], ["grandson", 0.06383313574121174], ["mcgarvey", 0.058827393665802315], ["group", 0.04671839054220075], ["em", 0.044993406872462054], ["bathroom", 0.04171264846679132], ["erasing", 0.03619525417035862], ["stepping", 0.03619525417035862], ["trifle", 0.03619525417035862], ["deepest", 0.03619525417035862], ["resignedly", 0.03619525417035862], ["dealt", 0.03619525417035862], ["disinheritance", 0.03619525417035862], ["misstep", 0.03619525417035862], ["quibble", 0.03619525417035862], ["heartbreaks", 0.03619525417035862], ["gurgling", 0.03619525417035862], ["erased", 0.03619525417035862], ["heir", 0.03619525417035862], ["quibbling", 0.03619525417035862], ["phrasing", 0.03619525417035862], ["ere", 0.03619525417035862], ["detached", 0.03619525417035862], ["heroically", 0.03619525417035862], ["dozed", 0.03619525417035862], ["serial", 0.03619525417035862], ["disrespectfulness", 0.03619525417035862], ["beaming", 0.03619525417035862], ["helpfully", 0.03619525417035862], ["malefactor", 0.03619525417035862], ["drastic", 0.03619525417035862], ["bed", 0.034229490398021985], ["emotions", 0.03191656787060587], ["vale", 0.03191656787060587], ["socket", 0.03191656787060587], ["swing", 0.03191656787060587], ["remembering", 0.03191656787060587], ["spoken", 0.03191656787060587], ["drain", 0.03191656787060587], ["washbasin", 0.03191656787060587], ["family", 0.03170116431597245], ["held", 0.03125218105460362], ["worn", 0.029413696832901157], ["bolt", 0.029413696832901157], ["cracked", 0.029413696832901157], ["plum", 0.029413696832901157], ["entered", 0.029413696832901157], ["engaged", 0.029413696832901157], ["completed", 0.029413696832901157], ["join", 0.029413696832901157], ["door", 0.029388241788556327], ["moments", 0.027637881570853128], ["choked", 0.027637881570853128], ["disturbed", 0.027637881570853128], ["scratched", 0.027637881570853128], ["lock", 0.027637881570853128], ["specifications", 0.027637881570853128], ["sentence", 0.02626045224175307], ["wished", 0.02626045224175307], ["louis", 0.02626045224175307], ["willy", 0.02626045224175307], ["faint", 0.02626045224175307], ["poured", 0.02626045224175307], ["panel", 0.02626045224175307], ["barely", 0.02626045224175307], ["land", 0.02626045224175307], ["time", 0.025761718765260743], ["reply", 0.025135010533148407], ["powerful", 0.025135010533148407], ["pressed", 0.025135010533148407], ["heard", 0.024597903267780323], ["including", 0.024183463126807307], ["wondered", 0.024183463126807307], ["changed", 0.024183463126807307], ["emotion", 0.023359195271100374], ["pain", 0.023359195271100374], ["schwartz", 0.02263213949544369], ["belonged", 0.02263213949544369], ["wrote", 0.021981765942000315], ["twelve", 0.021981765942000315], ["biggest", 0.021981765942000315], ["double", 0.021981765942000315], ["whispered", 0.021393431498763743], ["sixty", 0.021393431498763743], ["leaving", 0.021393431498763743], ["bedroom", 0.02085632423339566], ["deep", 0.02085632423339566], ["lines", 0.02085632423339566], ["happen", 0.020362233445287408], ["private", 0.020362233445287408], ["control", 0.020362233445287408], ["forget", 0.019904776827054556], ["apartment", 0.019904776827054556], ["hurt", 0.019904776827054556], ["nodded", 0.01908050897134763], ["tears", 0.01870628291075235], ["lay", 0.01870628291075235], ["speak", 0.018353453195690938], ["will", 0.01813804964105751], ["suddenly", 0.018019704916244793], ["foot", 0.018019704916244793], ["second", 0.018019704916244793], ["wait", 0.017703079642247568], ["sound", 0.017703079642247568], ["remember", 0.017703079642247568], ["write", 0.01740190578934984], ["brought", 0.015850582157986223], ["television", 0.015850582157986223], ["full", 0.01562609052730181], ["moment", 0.01520020860454285], ["looked", 0.015052349092058326], ["watch", 0.014997802290820685], ["minute", 0.014997802290820685], ["began", 0.014611874161306276], ["sir", 0.01312321948959709], ["mind", 0.01269733756683813], ["place", 0.012428910949926162], ["hand", 0.012298951633890162], ["young", 0.011924725573294884], ["great", 0.01180486084578191], ["day", 0.011687279395345525], ["better", 0.011458629570158186], ["years", 0.010819489576696206], ["thought", 0.009882415423190011], ["room", 0.009462332316739297], ["going", 0.007124080088183721], ["man", 0.006852104842541559]], "sentiment": ["At the end of these specifications, Gramps was so choked with emotion that Lou thought he might forget why he\u2019d gotten out the will in the first place.

Lou could have spoken his lines for him, he\u2019d heard them so often.\n\"I have had many heartbreaks ere leaving this vale of tears for a better land,\" Gramps said and wrote. \"But the deepest hurt of all has been dealt me by\u2014\" He looked around the group, trying to remember who the malefactor was.\nEveryone looked helpfully at Lou, who held up his hand resignedly.\nGramps nodded, remembering, and completed the sentence: \"my great-grandson, Louis J.

He wished Em would join him, and he wondered where she was.\nHe dozed for a few moments, until he was disturbed by someone\u2019s stepping over him to get into the bathroom. A moment later, he heard a faint gurgling sound, as though something were being poured down the washbasin drain. Suddenly, it entered his mind that Em had cracked up, and that she was in there doing something drastic about Gramps.\n\"Em\u2014?\" he whispered through the panel.
