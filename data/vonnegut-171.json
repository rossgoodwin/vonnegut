I knew where I could find her.\n\u201cI wonder if you could tell me,\u201d I said to the broken Leen, \u201cwhere I could find a pair of shoes to fit me at this time of night.\u201d\nHis voice came to me as though from the place where I was going next, the great cavern under Grand Central Station. \u201cNo problem,\u201d he said.\n23\nTHE NEXT THING I knew, I all alone, having made certain that no one was following me, was descending the iron staircase into the cavern.

I was wearing black patent leather evening slippers with little bows at the insteps. They had been given to me by the ten-year-old son of Arpad Leen, little Dexter. They were just my size. Dexter had been required to buy them for dancing school. He did not need them anymore. He had delivered his first successful ultimatum to his parents: He had told them that he would commit suicide if they insisted that he keep on going to dancing school. He hated dancing school that much.\nWhat a dear boy he was\u2014in his pajamas and bathrobe after a swim in the living room. He was so sympathetic and concerned for me, for a little old man who had no shoes for his little feet. I might have been a kindly elf in a fairy tale, and he might have been a princeling, making a gift to the elf of a pair of magic dancing shoes.\nWhat a beautiful boy he was. He had big brown eyes. His hair was a crown of black ringlets. I would have given a lot for a son like that. Then again, my own son, I imagine, would have given a lot for a father like Arpad Leen.\nFair is fair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Walter, Mary Kathleen,\u201d I called again. \u201cIt\u2019s Walter here.\u201d At the bottom of the steps, I came across the first clue that all might not be well.

He cocked his head, pretended to listen, though no sounds could travel through the vacuum in which he lived. \"You say, \u2019Please, King Boaz, play us the 1812 Overture\u2019?\" Boaz looked shocked, then stern. \"Just because something feels better than anything else,\" he said in his thoughts, \"that don\u2019t mean it\u2019s good for you.\"\nScholars whose field is the Martian War often exclaim over the queer unevenness of Rumfoord\u2019s war preparations. In some areas, his plans were horribly flimsy. The shoes he issued his ordinary troops, for instance, were almost a satire on the temporariness of the jerry-built society of Mars\u2014on a society whose whole purpose was to destroy itself in uniting the peoples of Earth.\nIn the music libraries Rumfoord personally selected for the company mother ships, however, one sees a great cultural nest egg\u2014a nest egg prepared as though for a monumental civilization that was going to endure for a thousand Earthling years. It is said that Rumfoord spent more time on the useless music libraries than he did on artillery and field sanitation combined.\nAs an anonymous wit has it: \"The Army of Mars arrived with three hundred hours of continuous music, and didn\u2019t last long enough to hear The Minute Waltz to the end.\"\nThe explanation of the bizarre emphasis on the music carried by the Martian mother ships is simple: Rumfoord was crazy about good music\u2014a craze, incidentally, that struck him only after he had been spread through time and space by the chrono-synclastic infundibulum.\nThe harmoniums in the caves of Mercury were crazy about good music, too. They had been feeding on one sustained note in the song of Mercury for centuries. When Boaz gave them their first taste of music, which happened to be Le Sacre du Printemps, some of the creatures actually died in ecstasy.\nA dead harmonium is shriveled and orange in the yellow light of the Mercurial caves. A dead harmonium looks like a dried apricot.\nOn that first occasion, which hadn\u2019t been planned as a concert for the harmoniums, the tape recorder had been on the floor of the space ship. The creatures who had actually died in ecstasy had been in direct contact with the metal hull of the ship.\nNow, two and a half years later, Boaz demonstrated the proper way to stage a concert for the creatures so as not to kill them.\nBoaz left his home vault, carrying the tape recorder and the musical selections for the concert with him. In the corridor outside were two aluminum ironing boards. These had fiber pads on their feet. The ironing boards were six feet apart, and spanning them was a stretcher made of aluminum poles and lichen-fiber canvas.", 0.017378048780487806], "title": "The Sirens of Titan"}, "cats-cradle": {"tfidf": [["feet", 0.19325427876739346], ["respond", 0.1459066526749759], ["responsive", 0.1459066526749759], ["attitude", 0.1459066526749759], ["cue", 0.1459066526749759], ["sill", 0.1459066526749759], ["cautious", 0.1459066526749759], ["wink", 0.1459066526749759], ["explains", 0.1281336480452337], ["grisly", 0.1281336480452337], ["relative", 0.1281336480452337], ["painters", 0.11773710681169104], ["wise", 0.11773710681169104], ["touch", 0.11036064341549154], ["rites", 0.10463901389461434], ["um", 0.09996410218194884], ["window", 0.09601152064791658], ["start", 0.09601152064791658], ["works", 0.09601152064791658], ["dying", 0.08956756094840618], ["simple", 0.08686600926487217], ["reading", 0.0844221585006587], ["hotel", 0.08219109755220667], ["feel", 0.08013872043237238], ["boko", 0.08013872043237238], ["maru", 0.0782385160181744], ["close", 0.07481463415600716], ["death", 0.07481463415600716], ["sir", 0.07481463415600716], ["mind", 0.071794556318664], ["told", 0.07109201851896875], ["better", 0.06550936508704899], ["people", 0.06398503578634583], ["bokononist", 0.06139801508512131], ["going", 0.045598370484510625]], "sentiment": ["\u201cVery simple.

parade rest while Dwayne told of his year as a County Executive for the Boy Scouts of America, when more black young people were brought into scouting than in any previous year. Dwayne told Wayne about his efforts to save the life of a young black man named Payton Brown, who, at the age of fifteen and a half, became the youngest person ever to die in the electric chair at Shepherdstown. Dwayne rambled on about all the black people he had hired when nobody else would hire black people, about how they never seemed to be able to get to work on time. He mentioned a few, too, who had been energetic and punctual, and he winked at Wayne, and he said this: \u201cThey were programmed that way.\u201d\nHe spoke of his wife and son again, acknowledged that white robots were just like black robots, essentially, in that they were programmed to be whatever they were, to do whatever they did.\nDwayne was silent for a moment after that.\nMary Alice Miller\u2019s father was meanwhile continuing to learn conversational French while lying down in his automobile, only a few yards away.\nAnd then Dwayne took a swing at Wayne. He meant to slap him hard with his open hand, but Wayne was very good at ducking. He dropped to his knees as the hand swished through the air where his face had been.\nDwayne laughed. \u201cAfrican dodger!\u201d he said. This had reference to a sort of carnival booth which was popular when Dwayne was a boy. A black man would stick his head through a hole in a piece of canvas at the back of a booth, and people would pay money for the privilege of throwing hard baseballs at his head. If they hit his head, they won a prize.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo Dwayne thought that the Creator of the Universe had invited him to play a game of African dodger now. He became cunning, concealed his violent intentions with apparent boredom. Then he kicked at Wayne very suddenly.\nWayne dodged again, and had to dodge yet again almost instantly, as Dwayne advanced with quick combinations of intended kicks, slaps, and punches. And Wayne vaulted onto the bed of a very unusual truck, which had been built on the chassis of a 1962 Cadillac limousine.

Since then, he\u2019d made a full-time career of raging about whoever was President of the United States, including Eisenhower.\nEspecially Eisenhower.\nSo I went down to Hyannis Port in my truck to measure the Commodore\u2019s windows late in June. His driveway was on Irving Avenue. So was the Kennedys\u2019 driveway. And President Kennedy and I hit Cape Cod on the very same day.\nTraffic to Hyannis Port was backed up through three villages. There were license plates from every state in the Republic. The line was moving about four miles an hour. I was passed by several groups of fifty-mile hikers. My radiator came to a boil four times.\nI was feeling pretty sorry for myself, because I was just an ordinary citizen, and had to get stuck in lines like that. But then I recognized the man in the limousine up ahead of me. It was Adlai Stevenson. He wasn\u2019t moving any faster than I was, and his radiator was boiling, too.\nOne place there, we got stuck so long that Mr. Stevenson and I got out and walked around a little. I took the opportunity to ask him how the United Nations were getting along. He told me they were getting along about as well as could be expected. That wasn\u2019t anything I didn\u2019t already know.\nWhen I finally got to Hyannis Port, I found out Irving Avenue was blocked off by police and Secret Service men. Adlai Stevenson got to go down it, but I didn\u2019t. The police made me get back into line with the tourists, who were being shunted down a street one block over from Irving Avenue.\nThe next thing I knew, I was in Hyannis, going past the Presidential Motor Inn, the First Family Waffle Shop, the PT-109 Cocktail Lounge, and a miniature golf course called the New Frontier.\nI went into the waffle shop, and I called up the Rumfoords to find out how an ordinary storm-window salesman was supposed to get down Irving Avenue without dying in a hail of lead. It was the butler I talked to. He took down my license number, and found out how tall I was and what color my eyes were and all. He said he would tell the Secret Service, and they would let me by next time.\nIt was late in the afternoon, and I\u2019d missed lunch, so I decided to have a waffle. All the different kinds of waffles were named after Kennedys and their friends and relatives. A waffle with strawberries and cream was a Jackie. A waffle with a scoop of ice cream was a Caroline.

It was natural for him to think of himself and his surroundings as moving, of the water below as standing still. He had been a merchant sailor for nine years\u2014a bridge tender for less than two days.\nHearing the noon howl of the fire horn, Red stopped his steering, and looked through his spyglass at Eddie Scudder\u2019s oyster shack below. The shack was rickety and helpless-looking on pilings in the river mouth, connected to the salt marsh shore by two springy planks. The river bottom around it was a twinkling white circle of oyster shells.\nEddie\u2019s eight-year-old daughter, Nancy, came out of the shack, and bounced gently on the planks, her face lifted to the sunshine. And then she stopped bouncing, and became demure.\nRed had taken the job for the opportunity it gave him to watch her. He knew what the demureness was. It was a prelude to a ceremony, the ceremony of Nancy\u2019s combing her bright red hair.\nRed\u2019s fingers played along the spyglass as though it were a clarinet. \u201cHello, Red,\u201d he whispered.\nNancy combed and combed and combed that cascade of red hair. Her eyes were closed, and each tug of the comb seemed to fill her with bittersweet ecstasy.\nThe combing left her languid. She walked through the salt meadow gravely, and climbed the steep bank to the road that crossed the bridge. Every day at noon, Nancy crossed the bridge to the lunchroom at the other end, to fetch a hot lunch for herself and her father.\nRed smiled down at Nancy as she came.\nSeeing the smile, she touched her hair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still there,\u201d said Red.", 0.08435672514619884], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["swift", 0.09074864782391473], ["gulliver",

as much as Swift does. And Swift harps on it long before Gulliver has gone insane. I would tell that teacher now, if she were still alive, that his harping is so relentless that it becomes ridiculous, and is meant to be ridiculous, and that Swift is teaching us a lesson almost as important as the one about our not being lambs: that our readiness to feel disgust for ourselves and others is not, perhaps, the guardian of civilization so many of us imagine it to be. Disgust, in fact, may be the chief damager of our reason, of our common sense\u2014may make us act against our own best interests, may make us insane.\nSwift does not develop this theme, but the history of the past hundred years or so has surely done it for him. What is it that has allowed civilized human beings to build and operate death camps? Disgust. What has encouraged them to bomb undefended cities, to torture prisoners, to beat up their own spouses and children, to blow out their own brains? Disgust. Yes. In my opinion, Gulliver\u2019s Travels is a remarkable effort to inject us with an overdose of disgustedness, and thus to immunize us from that most dangerous disease.\nThis Book-of-the-Month Club edition of Gulliver\u2019s Travels is based on the Oxford University Press edition of 1971, which was edited by Paul Turner, Lecturer in English Literature at Oxford. That edition has what this one lacks: an introduction and hundreds of fascinating notes by him. I recommend that edition to all who want the pleasure of relating the tale to Swift\u2019s own adventures and times, and who would like help in speculating as to the plausibleness of Captain Gulliver\u2019s endless lies. Mr. Turner tells us, for example: \u201cThe scale of Lilliput is one inch to a foot of the ordinary world. Mogg mentions [F. Mogg, Scientific American, Vol. CLXXIX, 1948] some biological difficulties: a Lilliputian would have room for far fewer cortical cells (so far less intelligence) than a chimpanzee; his head would be too small to carry useful eyes; and he would need eight times as many calories per ounce of body-weight as a full-scale man needs\u2014twenty-four meals a day instead of three.\u201d As for the giants of Brobdingnag, he refers to Mogg again, who \u201ccalls a sixty-foot man \u2019an engineering impossibility.\u2019 The skeleton would need considerable modification to support the weight (about ninety tons): shorter legs, smaller head, thicker neck, and larger trunk (to accommodate adequate internal organs to power such a huge machine).\u201d And so on.\nThe justification for publishing an edition as naked of notes as this one is, of course, is that the author, like all authors, wished his book to be loved for itself alone. If the ghost of Jonathan Swift is among us, it must resent terrifically my own Yahoolike intrusion here. I apologize. Next to my being in this volume at all, my most serious offense is failing to convey how much rage and joy and irrationality must have gone into the creation of this masterpiece. In praising the sanity of Gulliver\u2019s Travels, I have made it sound altogether too sane.\n15\nJEKYLL AMD HYDE UPDATED\nLEE GUBER, the Broadway producer, became a friend of mine when we served on the New York State Council for the Arts. During the summer of 1978 he asked me to write a modern version of Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for the musical stage. The original, by the way, is a tiny thing, no more than sixty pages. There is very little characterization in the original, which is surprisingly sketchy and sparsely populated. It was the first piece of writing for which Stevenson was paid.\nI never got paid for my version. I consider it excellent, if a little slapdash and short. It is called The Chemistry Professor, and it goes like this:\nTHE TIME: THE PRESENT, SPRINGTIME.\nTHE PLACE: SWEETBREAD COLLEGE, A SMALL, LIBERAL-ARTS INSTITUTION OUTSIDE PHILADELPHIA.", 0.11813257575757576], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["dwight", 0.10566807313365688], ["casey", 0.10566807313365688], ["muriel", 0.08797577814759207], ["fired", 0.0626757409351476], ["vacancy", 0.05283403656682844], ["tore", 0.05283403656682844], ["marrying", 0.05283403656682844], ["vine", 0.05283403656682844], ["hotel", 0.05283403656682844], ["cottage", 0.05283403656682844], ["boarding", 0.05283403656682844], ["rutgers", 0.05283403656682844], ["english", 0.05256904958263316], ["alive", 0.04793397550294236], ["barmaid", 0.04603847597310348], ["cornell", 0.04603847597310348], ["management", 0.04603847597310348], ["replaced", 0.04603847597310348], ["bs", 0.04206332785439599], ["mafia", 0.04206332785439599], ["housing", 0.04206332785439599], ["france", 0.04206332785439599], ["swarthmore", 0.04206332785439599], ["job", 0.041783827290098406], ["schools", 0.03924291537937853], ["lips", 0.03924291537937853], ["notice", 0.03924291537937853], ["lying", 0.03924291537937853], ["hadn", 0.038080210811600006], ["asleep", 0.03705523350374902], ["created", 0.03705523350374902], ["35", 0.03705523350374902], ["quit", 0.03705523350374902], ["political", 0.03705523350374902], ["master", 0.03526776726067104], ["covered", 0.033756486085893996], ["expensive", 0.033756486085893996], ["academic", 0.033756486085893996], ["silence", 0.033756486085893996], ["deal", 0.032447354785653575], ["clinton", 0.032447354785653575], ["peck", 0.032447354785653575], ["wife", 0.03238043355947319], ["education", 0.031292619141963546], ["shadow", 0.030259672910024068], ["surprise", 0.030259672910024068], ["degree", 0.029325259382530687], ["hated", 0.029325259382530687], ["attack", 0.029325259382530687], ["department", 0.029325259382530687], ["sun", 0.028472206666946085], ["today", 0.028472206666946085], ["moved", 0.028472206666946085], ["street", 0.02768747423877416], ["faculty", 0.02768747423877416], ["broke", 0.02628452479131658], ["taught", 0.02565179419192862], ["named", 0.025057435154512597], ["married", 0.024497058548238592], ["professor", 0.024497058548238592], ["teacher", 0.023464112316299118], ["kids", 0.023464112316299118], ["musket", 0.023464112316299118], ["south", 0.02298577737346155], ["mountain", 0.02298577737346155], ["asked", 0.022086114760297756], ["tarkington", 0.02127463993357512], ["top", 0.020891913645049203], ["stable", 0.020891913645049203], ["left", 0.020891913645049203], ["money", 0.019821332351274774], ["science", 0.019821332351274774], ["wouldn", 0.018554550670098244], ["head", 0.01826187456078764], ["making", 0.01826187456078764], ["family", 0.017701497954513635], ["trustees", 0.017432880560512513], ["full", 0.017171427157746225], ["year", 0.016668551722574164], ["great", 0.016668551722574164], ["big", 0.01573413819508078], ["valley", 0.015513816078884128], ["time", 0.014413948620764266], ["good", 0.01409635305132425], ["wasn", 0.011466313967062687], ["thought", 0.010770708712432448], ["2", 0.01063731996678756]], "sentiment": ["It was I who broke the silence.

The reviews were mixed, from Newsweek\u2019s \u201c\u2026 Vonnegut\u2019s dialogue is not only fast and funny, with a palpable taste and crackle, but it also means something\u201d to The New Republic\u2019s \u201c\u2026 a disaster, full of callow wit, rheumatic invention, and dormitory profundity.\u201d It was produced as a movie in 1971 starring Rod Steiger. Kurt wanted to have his name removed from the movie credits but wrote in Palm Sunday: \u201cThis proved impossible, however. I alone had done the thing the credits said I had done. I had really written the thing.\u201d\nDear Spic\u2014\n[\u2026] The adventure of having a play produced was harrowing. The reviews ranged from adoration to hatred. My own feeling is that the play is clumsy and sophomoric. But I had to begin my theatrical career with something\u2014and now I have in fact begun. I\u2019ve written six novels. Now I want to write six plays. The play was produced off-Broadway, which means, mainly, in Greenwich Village. Unions have had easier, cheaper rules for off-Broadway productions\u2014on the theory that the shabby little theaters were good schools for persons who would later hit the big theaters up-town. Well, the unions have now closed down off-Broadway, demanding enormous raises. So we are moving our show onto Broadway, from a 300-seat slum to a 500-seat palace. We will reopen on December 22nd, and I suppose I\u2019ll go crazy again. If I had your stomach problem, Pepe, I would be dead.
