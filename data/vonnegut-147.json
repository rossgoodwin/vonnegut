I wasn\u2019t in any of them, of course. The people who had brought me in and the man who had locked me up had all gone off-duty. None of them could be reached at home.\nBut then the detective who was trying to placate my lawyer remembered the cell downstairs and decided to have a look inside it, just in case.\nWhen the key turned in the lock, I was lying on my stomach like a dog in a kennel, facing the door. My stocking feet extended in the direction of the bowling trophy and the crap. I had removed my shoes for some reason.\nWhen the detective opened the door, he was appalled to see me, realizing how long I must have been in there. The City of New York had accidentally committed a very serious crime against me.\n\u201cMr. Starbuck\u2014?\u201d he asked anxiously.\nI said nothing. I did sit up. I no longer cared where I was or what might happen next. I was like a hooked fish that had done all the fighting it could. Whatever was on the other end of the line was welcome to reel me in.\nWhen the detective said, \u201cYour lawyer is here,\u201d I did not protest even inwardly that nobody knew I was in jail, that I had no lawyer, no friends, no anything. So be it: My lawyer was there.\nNow the lawyer showed himself. It would not have surprised me if he had been a unicorn. He was, in fact, almost that fantastic\u2014a man who, when only twenty-six years old, had been chief counsel of the Senate Permanent Investigating Committee, whose chairman was Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the most spectacular hunter of disloyal Americans since World War Two.\nHe was in his late forties now\u2014but still unsmiling and nervously shrewd. During the McCarthy Era, which came after Leland Clewes and I had made such fools of ourselves, I had hated and feared this man. He was on my side now.\n\u201cMr. Starbuck,\u201d he said, \u201cI am here to represent you, if you want me to. I have been retained on your behalf by The RAMJAC Corporation. Roy M.

He and his dog had, at that time, no particular religious significance. They were merely tourist attractions.\nThe Rumfoord estate had been leased by the mortgage holders to a showman named Marlin T. Lapp. Lapp sold tickets to materializations for a dollar apiece.\nSave for the appearance and then the disappearance of Rumfoord and his dog, it wasn\u2019t much of a show. Rumfoord wouldn\u2019t say a word to anyone but Moncrief, the butler, and he whispered to him. He would slouch broodingly in a wing chair in the room under the staircase, in Skip\u2019s Museum. And he would cover his eyes with one hand and twine the fingers of his other hand around Kazak\u2019s choke chain.\nRumfoord and Kazak were billed as ghosts.\nThere was a scaffolding outside the window of the little room, and the door to the corridor had been removed. Two lines of sightseers could file past for a peek at the chrono-synclastic infundibulated man and dog.\n\"I guess he don\u2019t feel much like talking today, folks,\" Marlin T.

County was far from insane. It was quite possibly the most important social experiment of our time, for it dealt on a very small scale with a problem whose queasy horrors will eventually be made world-wide by the sophistication of machines. The problem is this: How to love people who have no use?\n\"In time, almost all men and women will become worthless as producers of goods, food, services, and more machines, as sources of practical ideas in the areas of economics, engineering, and probably medicine, too. So\u2014if we can't find reasons and methods for treasuring human beings because they are human beings, then we might as well, as has so often been suggested, rub them out.\"\n\"Americans have long been taught to hate all people who will not or cannot work, to hate even themselves for that. We can thank the vanished frontier for that piece of common-sense cruelty. The time is coming, if it isn't here now, when it will no longer be common sense. It will simply be cruel.\"\n\"A poor man with gumption can still elevate himself out of the mire,\" said the Senator, \"and that will continue to be true a thousand years from now.\"\n\"Maybe, maybe,\" Trout answered gently. \"He may even have so much gumption that his descendents will live in a Utopia like Pisquontuit, where, I'm sure, the soul-rot and silliness and torpor and insensitivity are exactly as horrible as anything epidemic in Rosewater County. Poverty is a relatively mild disease for even a very flimsy American soul, but uselessness will kill strong and weak souls alike, and kill every time.\n\"We must find a cure.\"\n\"Your devotion to volunteer fire departments is very sane, too, Eliot, for they are, when the alarm goes off, almost the only examples of enthusiastic unselfishness to be seen in this land. They rush to the rescue of any human being, and count not the cost. The most contemptible man in town, should his contemptible house catch fire, will see his enemies put the fire out. And, as he pokes through the ashes for remains of his contemptible possessions, he will be comforted and pitied by no less than the Fire Chief.\"\nTrout spread his hands. \"There we have people treasuring people as people. It's extremely rare. So from this we must learn.\"\n\"By God, you're great!\" the Senator said to Trout. \"You should have been a public relations man!

But a person\u2019s personality changes, too\u2014and his future\u2014his or her future, as the case may be.\u201d\n\u201cThe women we\u2019re looking for\u2014they went through these mirrors?\u201d said Foltz.\n\u201cYes\u2014the women you\u2019re looking for, and about a dozen more you\u2019re not looking for besides,\u201d said Weems. \u201cThey came to me with the shapeless longings of widows with money, but without confidence, hope, irresistible beauty, or dreams. They had been to physicians and quacks of every sort before they came to me. They could describe neither their ailment nor the hoped for cure. It was up to me to define both.\u201d\n\u201cSo what did you tell them?\u201d said Foltz.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you make a diagnosis on the basis of what I\u2019ve told you?\u201d said Weems. \u201cIt was their futures that were sick. And for sick futures\u201d\u2014and he swept his hand at the seeming doors all around them\u2014\u201cI know only one cure.\u201d\nWeems shouted now, and then listened as though expecting faint replies. \u201cMrs. Cantwell? Mary?\u201d he called. \u201cMrs. Forbes?\u201d\n\u201cWho is Mrs. Forbes?\u201d said Foltz.", -0.03596938775510204], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["religious",

and help it. Many people are now seeing dignity in the lower animals and the plant world and waterfalls and deserts\u2014and even in the entire planet and its atmosphere. And now they are helpless not to want to understand and to help those things.\n\u201cPoor souls!\n\u201cI am descended from fairly recent immigrants. My first American ancestor, an atheistic merchant from M\u00fcnster, arrived here about five years after William Ellery Channing died. Channing died in 1842, a reluctant Abolitionist who did not live to see all the murdering in the Civil War. I am a drop of spray from one of the waves which swamped the American Atlantis.\n\u201cThe faith of my ancestors, going back at least four generations, has been the most corrosive sort of agnosticism\u2014or worse. When I was a child, all my relatives, male and female, agreed with H. L. Mencken when he said that he thought religious people were comical. Mencken said that he had been widely misunderstood as hating religious people. He did not hate them, he said. He merely found them comical.\n\u201cWhat is so comical about religious people in modern times? They believe so many things which science has proved to be unknowable or absolutely wrong.\n\u201cHow on earth can religious people believe in so much arbitrary, clearly invented balderdash? For one thing, I guess, the balderdash is usually beautiful\u2014and therefore echoes excitingly in the more primitive lobes of our brains, where knowledge counts for nothing.\n\u201cMore important, though: the acceptance of a creed, any creed, entitles the acceptor to membership in the sort of artificial extended family we call a congregation. It is a way to fight loneliness. Any time I see a person fleeing from reason and into religion, I think to myself, There goes a person who simply cannot stand being so goddamned lonely anymore.\n\u201cI read an essay by Harvey Cox recently, in which he quoted an early Church father as having said, \u2019One Christian is no Christian.\u2019 Mr. Cox said that one of the most distinctive and attractive features of Christianity for him was its insistence on forming congregations.\n\u201cWe might also say that one human being is no human being.\n\u201cMany people have found a solution to loneliness by joining the paratroops. Membership in that particular family is gained and maintained by jumping out of airplanes and shouting \u2019Geronimo!\u2019 Not even the commanding general knows why everybody is supposed to shout \u2019Ger\u00f3nimo!\u2019 It does not matter.", 0.08746556473829198], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["tapes", 0.15018412519400268], ["broadcasting", 0.14275686701500664], ["vcr", 0.10706765026125499], ["museum", 0.09529304001558797], ["adopted", 0.07509206259700134], ["prisons", 0.050061375064667554], ["sets", 0.0456047891491548], ["tv", 0.039494192347437326], ["duplicated", 0.03568921675375166], ["pillbox", 0.03568921675375166], ["harbor", 0.03568921675375166], ["biological", 0.03568921675375166], ["entering", 0.03568921675375166], ["paroling", 0.03568921675375166], ["central", 0.03568921675375166], ["demanded", 0.03568921675375166], ["stoked", 0.03568921675375166], ["charcoal", 0.03568921675375166], ["populations", 0.03568921675375166], ["transferring", 0.03568921675375166], ["99", 0.03568921675375166], ["hibachi", 0.03568921675375166], ["metropolitan", 0.03568921675375166], ["briquettes", 0.03568921675375166], ["office", 0.03465540407386383], ["course", 0.031885074752945164], ["athena", 0.031885074752945164], ["assassination", 0.031098838074546727], ["cruisers", 0.031098838074546727], ["socially", 0.031098838074546727], ["presented", 0.031098838074546727], ["materialized", 0.031098838074546727], ["crawled", 0.031098838074546727], ["hundreds", 0.031098838074546727], ["convertible", 0.031098838074546727], ["waited", 0.031098838074546727], ["bingo", 0.031098838074546727], ["limousine", 0.031098838074546727], ["missile", 0.031098838074546727], ["recall", 0.031098838074546727], ["girlfriend", 0.031098838074546727], ["carriers", 0.031098838074546727], ["provide", 0.031098838074546727], ["donor", 0.031098838074546727], ["cassettes", 0.031098838074546727], ["portholes", 0.031098838074546727], ["liner", 0.031098838074546727], ["weren", 0.03105363300785534], ["library", 0.02928500529097424], ["warden", 0.02928500529097424], ["hokkaido", 0.028413638683101927], ["tvs", 0.028413638683101927], ["trunk", 0.028413638683101927], ["segregated", 0.028413638683101927], ["mixed", 0.028413638683101927], ["consider", 0.028413638683101927], ["scheme", 0.028413638683101927], ["converted", 0.028413638683101927], ["directors", 0.028413638683101927], ["son", 0.02724327443233506], ["sentence", 0.02650845939534179], ["hat", 0.02650845939534179], ["flew", 0.02650845939534179], ["kennedy", 0.02650845939534179], ["strangled", 0.02650845939534179], ["aircraft", 0.02650845939534179], ["ocean", 0.02650845939534179], ["prison", 0.025070741015263163], ["large", 0.025030687532333777], ["murderer", 0.025030687532333777], ["murdered", 0.025030687532333777], ["doors", 0.025030687532333777], ["connected", 0.025030687532333777], ["basis", 0.023823260003896993], ["races", 0.023823260003896993], ["ships", 0.0228023945745774], ["inmates", 0.0228023945745774], ["industry", 0.021918080716136854], ["serve", 0.021918080716136854], ["watched", 0.021918080716136854], ["serving", 0.021138060612452193], ["art", 0.020440308853128843], ["girl", 0.020440308853128843], ["donner", 0.020440308853128843], ["dream", 0.020440308853128843], ["member", 0.019232881324692058], ["father", 0.019044079619007594], ["understand", 0.01870279716791367], ["john", 0.01870279716791367], ["hand", 0.01870279716791367], ["matsumoto", 0.017755109461684047], ["guard", 0.017755109461684047], ["english", 0.017755109461684047], ["race", 0.017327702036931916], ["played", 0.016926214475233674], ["lot", 0.01671440191750211], ["wearing", 0.016547681933247262], ["help", 0.016189620865232186], ["parents", 0.016189620865232186], ["news", 0.016189620865232186], ["york", 0.015218736930186655], ["better", 0.014924354396604975], ["talk", 0.01464250264548712], ["board", 0.01362163721616753], ["japanese", 0.01362163721616753], ["order", 0.01362163721616753], ["president", 0.01294757963795599], ["head", 0.012335835796028738], ["american", 0.011957303254042323], ["full", 0.011599242186027252], ["wife", 0.010936437824722731], ["convicts", 0.010191550517261207], ["time", 0.00973657456501957], ["2", 0.0071854744146512], ["life", 0.006669172815514035], ["years", 0.006586904471152729], ["people", 0.004500275023206401]], "sentiment": ["Life was like an ocean liner to a lot of people who weren\u2019t in prison, too, of course.

A guard who might not even understand English kept the central VCR stoked with whatever came to hand, just as though the cassettes were charcoal briquettes and the VCR was a hibachi back on Hokkaido.\nBut this whole scheme was an American invention taken over by the Japanese, like the VCR and the TV sets.

So the father had hundreds of tapes of TV shows in the library of the Museum of Broadcasting duplicated and presented to the prison. His dream, apparently, was that the tapes would provide the basis for a course at Athena in Broadcasting, which industry some of the inmates might consider entering after they got out, if they ever got out.\nBut the course in Broadcasting never materialized. So the tapes were run over and over again as something better than nothing for the convicts to look at while they were serving time.\nTHE ADOPTED SON of the donor of the tapes came back into the news briefly at the time the prison populations were being segregated according to race. There was talk of paroling him and a lot of others rather than transferring them to other prisons.\nBut the parents of the girl he had murdered behind the museum, who were well connected socially, demanded that he serve his full sentence, which, as I recall it, was 99 years. He was adopted, as I say. It came out that his biological father had also been a murderer.\nSo he now may be on one of the aircraft carriers or missile cruisers in New York Harbor that have been converted into prison ships.\nWHILE DONNER AND I waited to see the Warden, we watched the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Bingo! The back of his head flew off. His wife, wearing a pillbox hat, crawled out over the trunk of the convertible limousine.", 0.03192107409498713], "title": "Hocus Pocus"}, "deadeye-dick": {"tfidf": [["rudy", 0.16843392206072183], ["celia", 0.10044386955798437], ["telephone", 0.09276505030917759], ["guts", 0.0877976359843888], ["rings", 0.0877976359843888], ["abusive", 0.0877976359843888], ["listens", 0.0877976359843888], ["understanding", 0.0877976359843888], ["excuse", 0.0877976359843888], ["effects", 0.0877976359843888], ["blankly", 0.0877976359843888], ["leads", 0.07624518297505638], ["hangs", 0.07624518297505638], ["hates", 0.07624518297505638], ["reach", 0.07624518297505638], ["dwayne", 0.07411119071133017], ["hate", 0.06948743117325364], ["someplace", 0.06948743117325364], ["term", 0.06948743117325364], ["detroit", 0.06469272996572395], ["lady", 0.06097367077715379], ["prescription", 0.06097367077715379], ["expect", 0.06097367077715379], ["question", 0.057934978163921215], ["mitchell", 0.057934978163921215], ["pills", 0.05536580016680025], ["amphetamine", 0.05536580016680025], ["dr", 0.053140276956391536], ["mine", 0.053140276956391536], ["blocks", 0.053140276956391536], ["answer", 0.05117722636211847], ["long", 0.05100628469266533], ["doctor", 0.04783271477108263], ["week", 0.04783271477108263], ["counter", 0.04783271477108263], ["schramm", 0.046382525154588794], ["beat", 0.046382525154588794], ["crazy", 0.04504848002669652], ["husband", 0.04266346596601864], ["deadeye", 0.04057741358345187], ["dick", 0.03962477335278605], ["call", 0.037055595355665084], ["living", 0.037055595355665084], ["son", 0.0362802617617502], ["hoover", 0.034149705569918795], ["play", 0.03167603881794757], ["wanted", 0.03167603881794757], ["will", 0.031111012956686213], ["good", 0.02162610409185344]], "sentiment": ["(Telephone behind prescription counter rings.

The manuscript of Slaughterhouse-Five should be waiting for you there. I mailed it off to you yesterday. Max has a copy, too.\nAbout the promotional tour of colleges which the publicity lady at Dell has proposed:\nThe economics of such a tour would be confusing, Sam, since I am not only in the writing business but the speaking business, too. Without any manager or promotion, I now get $500 and all expenses for speaking, and am offered more engagements than I care to fill. Over the years, I have worked up a quite funny act that seems to be worth that much. Granville Hicks saw it, wrote about it in the SRL a few weeks back.\nDell now suggest that I do this for nothing, in order to sell books. It seems to me that this would be unbuilding my speaking business, and that the number of books my appearances would sell would be small.

["Dwayne Hoover, incidentally, wasn\u2019t taking any of this in. He was still hypnotized, turned inward. He was thinking about moving fingers writing and moving on, and so forth. He had bats in his bell tower. He was off his rocker. He wasn\u2019t playing with a full deck of cards.\n20\nWHILE MY LIFE was being renewed by the words of Rabo Karabekian, Kilgore Trout found himself standing on the shoulder of the Interstate, gazing across Sugar Creek in its concrete trough at the new Holiday Inn. There were no bridges across the creek. He would have to wade.\nSo he sat down on a guardrail, removed his shoes and socks, rolled his pantlegs to his knees. His bared shins were rococo with varicose veins and scars. So were the shins of my father when he was an old, old man.\nKilgore Trout had my father\u2019s shins. They were a present from me. I gave him my father\u2019s feet, too, which were long and narrow and sensitive. They were azure. They were artistic feet.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTrout lowered his artistic feet into the concrete trough containing Sugar Creek. They were coated at once with a clear plastic substance from the surface of the creek. When, in some surprise, Trout lifted one coated foot from the water, the plastic substance dried in air instantly, sheathed his foot in a thin, skin-tight bootie resembling mother-of-pearl. He repeated the process with his other foot.\nThe substance was coming from the Barrytron plant. The company was manufacturing a new anti-personnel bomb for the Air Force. The bomb scattered plastic pellets instead of steel pellets, because the plastic pellets were cheaper. They were also impossible to locate in the bodies of wounded enemies by means of x-ray machines.\nBarrytron had no idea it was dumping this waste into Sugar Creek. They had hired the Maritimo Brothers Construction Company, which was gangster-controlled, to build a system which would get rid of the waste. They knew the company was gangster-controlled. Everybody knew that. But the Maritimo Brothers were usually the best builders in town. They had built Dwayne Hoover\u2019s house, for instance, which was a solid house.\nBut every so often they would do something amazingly criminal. The Barrytron disposal system was a case in point. It was expensive, and it appeared to be complicated and busy. Actually, though, it was old junk hooked up every which way, concealing a straight run of stolen sewer pipe running directly from Barrytron to Sugar Creek.", -0.010843281297826749], "title": "Breakfast of Champions"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["marie", 0.14535369605859697], ["mature", 0.1318412920718699], ["robert", 0.1291689545852418], ["ashamed", 0.1056838566273911], ["dilemma", 0.06592064603593495], ["cocktail", 0.06592064603593495], ["individual", 0.06592064603593495], ["immaturity", 0.06592064603593495], ["film", 0.06592064603593495], ["siren", 0.06592064603593495], ["feeding", 0.06592064603593495], ["contemplating", 0.06592064603593495], ["raid", 0.06592064603593495], ["shhhhh", 0.06592064603593495], ["downstairs", 0.06592064603593495], ["devised", 0.06592064603593495], ["spools", 0.06592064603593495], ["warden", 0.06592064603593495], ["rivalry", 0.06592064603593495], ["catching", 0.06592064603593495], ["promised", 0.0576688938864118], ["advantage", 0.0576688938864118], ["tutor", 0.0576688938864118], ["backward", 0.0576688938864118], ["combination", 0.0576688938864118], ["carries", 0.0576688938864118], ["chief", 0.0576688938864118], ["girlfriend", 0.05284192831369555], ["charge", 0.05284192831369555], ["biggest", 0.05284192831369555], ["furniture", 0.05284192831369555], ["loves", 0.05284192831369555], ["hang", 0.05284192831369555], ["deliver", 0.05284192831369555], ["polish", 0.05284192831369555], ["shame", 0.04941714173688864], ["lovely", 0.04941714173688864], ["class", 0.04941714173688864], ["stairway", 0.04941714173688864], ["airplane", 0.04676067088790995], ["party", 0.04676067088790995], ["smell", 0.04676067088790995], ["duty", 0.0445901761641724], ["bigger", 0.0445901761641724], ["kids", 0.0445901761641724], ["marry", 0.0445901761641724], ["factory", 0.042755049023371704], ["war", 0.041165389587365486], ["early", 0.039763210591456155], ["step", 0.039763210591456155], ["hall", 0.039763210591456155], ["clear", 0.039763210591456155], ["plan", 0.039763210591456155], ["meet", 0.03850891873838679], ["pisquontuit", 0.03633842401464924], ["dance", 0.03538553463758333], ["arms", 0.03538553463758333], ["glad", 0.03538553463758333], ["free", 0.03538553463758333], ["whispered", 0.034503296873848545], ["air", 0.033681953165670554], ["sound", 0.030867801045858283], ["lot", 0.029676331301132303], ["nice", 0.02808667186512608], ["high", 0.026684492869216755], ["wouldn", 0.025430201016147392], ["things", 0.0235950738753467], ["love", 0.022616048896335127], ["voice", 0.022005414439340478], ["money", 0.02171145476564558], ["people", 0.020870769441669944], ["thought", 0.018882030338537015], ["thing", 0.017582038767525204], ["time", 0.012484498777219011], ["man", 0.011097191440838634]], "sentiment": ["\u201cA combination of things,\u201d said Robert. \u201cThe war mostly.
