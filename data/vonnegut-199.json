Brackman didn\u2019t take his own suggestion seriously\u2014that the Space Wanderer was a fraud. The concessionaires knew all too well about Rumfoord\u2019s penchant for realism. When Rumfoord staged a passion play, he used nothing but real people in real hells.\nLet it be emphasized here that, passionately fond as Rumfoord was of great spectacles, he never gave in to the temptation to declare himself God or something a whole lot like God.\nHis worst enemies admit that. Dr. Maurice Rosenau, in his Pan-Galactic Humbug or Three Billion Dupes says:\nWinston Niles Rumfoord, the interstellar Pharisee, Tartufe, and Cagliostro, has taken pains to declare that he is not God Almighty, that he is not a close relative of God Almighty, and that he has received no plain instructions from God Almighty. To these words of the Master of Newport we can say Amen! And may we add that Rumfoord is so far from being a relative or agent of God Almighty as to make all communication with God Almighty Himself impossible so long as Rumfoord is around!\nOrdinarily, talk by the Martian veterans in the shuttered booths was sprightly\u2014bristling with entertaining irreverence and tips on selling trashy religious articles to boobs.\nNow, with Rumfoord and the Space Wanderer about to meet, the concessionaires found it very hard not to be interested.\nSergeant Brackman\u2019s good hand went up to the crown of his head. It was the characteristic gesture of a Martian veteran. He was touching the area over his antenna, over the antenna that had once done all his important thinking for him.

someone said.\nSo \"Pop\" shot sevens\u2014ten in a row to bankrupt the barracks. He retired to his bunk and, as a mathematical exercise, calculated the odds against his feat on the back of a laundry slip. His chances of doing it, he found, were one in almost ten million! Bewildered, he borrowed a pair of dice from the man in the bunk next to his. He tried to roll sevens again, but got only the usual assortment of numbers. He lay back for a moment, then resumed his toying with the dice. He rolled ten more sevens in a row.\nHe might have dismissed the phenomenon with a low whistle. But the professor instead mulled over the circumstances surrounding his two lucky streaks. There was one single factor in common: on both occasions, the same thought train had flashed through his mind just before he threw the dice. It was that thought train which aligned the professor\u2019s brain cells into what has since become the most powerful weapon on earth.\nThe soldier in the next bunk gave dynamopsychism its first token of respect. In an understatement certain to bring wry smiles to the faces of the world\u2019s dejected demagogues, the soldier said, \"You\u2019re hotter\u2019n a two-dollar pistol, Pop.\" Professor Barnhouse was all of that. The dice that did his bidding weighed but a few grams, so the forces involved were minute; but the unmistakable fact that there were such forces was earth-shaking.\nProfessional caution kept him from revealing his discovery immediately. He wanted more facts and a body of theory to go with them. Later, when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, it was fear that made him hold his peace. At no time were his experiments, as Premier Slezak called them, \"a bourgeois plot to shackle the true democracies of the world.\" The professor didn\u2019t know where they were leading.\nIn time, he came to recognize another startling feature of dynamopsychism: its strength increased with use. Within six months, he was able to govern dice thrown by men the length of a barracks distant. By the time of his discharge in 1945, he could knock bricks loose from chimneys three miles away.\nCharges that Professor Barnhouse could have won the last war in a minute, but did not care to do so, are perfectly senseless. When the war ended, he had the range and power of a 37-millimeter cannon, perhaps\u2014certainly no more. His dynamopsychic powers graduated from the small-arms class only after his discharge and return to Wyandotte College.\nI enrolled in the Wyandotte Graduate School two years after the professor had rejoined the faculty. By chance, he was assigned as my thesis adviser. I was unhappy about the assignment, for the professor was, in the eyes of both colleagues and students, a somewhat ridiculous figure. He missed classes or had lapses of memory during lectures. When I arrived, in fact, his shortcomings had passed from the ridiculous to the intolerable.\n\"We\u2019re assigning you to Barnhouse as a sort of temporary thing,\" the dean of social studies told me. He looked apologetic and perplexed. \"Brilliant man, Barnhouse, I guess. Difficult to know since his return, perhaps, but his work before the war brought a great deal of credit to our little school.\"\nWhen I reported to the professor\u2019s laboratory for the first time, what I saw was more distressing than the gossip. Every surface in the room was covered with dust; books and apparatus had not been disturbed for months. The professor sat napping at his desk when I entered. The only signs of recent activity were three overflowing ashtrays, a pair of scissors, and a morning paper with several items clipped from its front page.", 0.07932838438157588], "title": "Welcome to

the echoing blackness below. He was panting from the long climb up the mountain slope, and his bald head glistened with perspiration.\n\u201cA remarkable hole,\u201d said Josef\u2019s twenty-five-year-old brother, Peter, his long, big-jointed frame uncomfortable in fog-dampened clothes. He searched his thoughts for a more profound comment, but found nothing. It was a perfectly amazing hole\u2014no question about it. The officious mine supervisor, Borgorov, had said it had been sunk a half mile deep on the site of a radioactive mineral water spring. Borgorov\u2019s enthusiasm for the hole didn\u2019t seem in the least diminished by the fact that it had produced no uranium worth mining.\nPeter studied Borgorov with interest. He seemed a pompous ass of a young man, yet his name merited fear and respect whenever it was mentioned in a gathering of miners. It was said, not without awe, that he was the favorite third cousin of Stalin himself, and that he was merely serving an apprenticeship for much bigger things.\nPeter and his brother, Russia\u2019s leading myrmecologists, had been summoned from the University of Dnipropetrovsk to see the hole\u2014or, rather, to see the fossils that had come out of it. Myrmecology, they had explained to the hundred-odd guards who had stopped them on their way into the area, was that branch of science devoted to the study of ants. Apparently, the hole had struck a rich vein of petrified ants.\nPeter nudged a rock the size of his head and rolled it into the hole. He shrugged and walked away from it, whistling tunelessly. He was remembering again the humiliation of a month ago, when he had been forced to apologize publicly for his paper on Raptiformica sanguinea, the warlike, slave-raiding ants found under hedges. Peter had presented it to the world as a masterpiece of scholarship and scientific method, only to be rewarded by a stinging rebuke from Moscow. Men who couldn\u2019t tell Raptiformica sanguinea from centipedes had branded him an ideological backslider with dangerous tendencies toward Western decadence. Peter clenched and unclenched his fists, angry, frustrated. In effect, he had had to apologize because the ants he had studied would not behave the way the top Communist scientific brass wanted them to.\n\u201cProperly led,\u201d said Borgorov, \u201cpeople can accomplish anything they set their minds to. This hole was completed within a month from the time orders came down from Moscow. Someone very high dreamed we would find uranium on this very spot,\u201d he added mysteriously.\n\u201cYou will be decorated,\u201d said Peter absently, testing a point on the barbed wire around the opening. His reputation had preceded him into the area, he supposed. At any rate, Borgorov avoided his eyes, and addressed his remarks always to Josef\u2014Josef the rock, the dependable, the ideologically impeccable. It was Josef who had advised against publishing the controversial paper, Josef who had written his apology. Now, Josef was loudly comparing the hole to the Pyramids, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and the Colossus of Rhodes.\nBorgorov rambled on tiresomely, Josef agreed warmly, and Peter allowed his gaze and thoughts to wander over the strange new countryside. Beneath his feet were the Erzge-birge\u2014the Ore Mountains, dividing Russian-occupied Germany from Czechoslovakia. Gray rivers of men streamed to and from pits and caverns gouged in the green mountain slopes\u2014a dirty, red-eyed horde burrowing for uranium \u2026\n\u201cWhen would you like to see the fossil ants we found?\u201d said Borgorov, cutting into his thoughts. \u201cThey\u2019re locked up now, but we can get at them anytime tomorrow. I\u2019ve got them all arranged in the order of the levels we found them in.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Josef, \u201cthe best part of the day was used up getting cleared to come up here, so we couldn\u2019t get much done until tomorrow morning anyway.\u201d", 0.051871505755226685], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "palm-sunday": {"tfidf": [["utterson", 0.3260002100881622], ["effects", 0.11117831621940517], ["hyde", 0.11106663365386607], ["jekyll", 0.10531691059651493], ["jerry", 0.08584463933125058], ["pub", 0.07855457475114638], ["harmful", 0.07411887747960345], ["pops", 0.07330292462840199], ["kimberly", 0.06865832308984364], ["bombs", 0.059272765470574945], ["asks", 0.05538516989690222], ["real", 0.049465023562849306], ["daylights", 0.03705943873980173], ["guignol", 0.03705943873980173], ["identifies", 0.03705943873980173], ["vision", 0.03705943873980173], ["ankles", 0.03705943873980173], ["constipation", 0.03705943873980173], ["blurred", 0.03705943873980173], ["scares", 0.03705943873980173], ["unobserved", 0.03705943873980173], ["chokes", 0.03705943873980173], ["involves", 0.03705943873980173], ["streetlamp", 0.03705943873980173], ["catsup", 0.03705943873980173], ["shattering", 0.03705943873980173], ["clinging", 0.03705943873980173], ["confesses", 0.03705943873980173], ["choking", 0.03705943873980173], ["qualifications", 0.03705943873980173], ["spitting", 0.03705943873980173], ["swollen", 0.03705943873980173], ["dead", 0.03505979967019582], ["side", 0.03432916154492182], ["handle", 0.03237601184412642], ["imbecile", 0.03237601184412642], ["suggests", 0.03237601184412642], ["impossibly", 0.03237601184412642], ["blew", 0.03237601184412642], ["dropping", 0.03237601184412642], ["controlling", 0.03237601184412642], ["bullet", 0.03237601184412642], ["babies", 0.029636382735287473], ["kills", 0.029636382735287473], ["safe", 0.029636382735287473], ["knocks", 0.029636382735287473], ["idealistic", 0.029636382735287473], ["puts", 0.029636382735287473], ["drama", 0.029636382735287473], ["tongue", 0.029636382735287473], ["sticking", 0.029636382735287473], ["chemicals", 0.029636382735287473], ["throat", 0.029636382735287473], ["bullets", 0.029636382735287473], ["echoes", 0.029636382735287473], ["barrel", 0.029636382735287473], ["draws", 0.02769258494845111], ["stops", 0.02769258494845111], ["attack", 0.02769258494845111], ["perambulator", 0.02769258494845111], ["carried", 0.02769258494845111], ["sings", 0.02769258494845111], ["holding", 0.02769258494845111], ["picks", 0.02769258494845111], ["shot", 0.026184858250382127], ["grand", 0.026184858250382127], ["trash", 0.026184858250382127], ["feels", 0.024952955839612167], ["gun", 0.024952955839612167], ["bag", 0.024952955839612167], ["exit", 0.024952955839612167], ["pistol", 0.024952955839612167], ["loaded", 0.024952955839612167], ["tragic", 0.024952955839612167], ["respectable", 0.023911397192130687], ["shoot", 0.023911397192130687], ["experiments", 0.023009158052775806], ["turns", 0.023009158052775806], ["dangerous", 0.023009158052775806], ["tells", 0.023009158052775806], ["lab", 0.023009158052775806], ["mad", 0.022213326730773215], ["dog", 0.022213326730773215], ["perfectly", 0.02150143135470682], ["drink", 0.02150143135470682], ["character", 0.020857443653326247], ["discovered", 0.020269528943936858], ["song", 0.020269528943936858], ["felt", 0.020269528943936858], ["takes", 0.020269528943936858], ["baby", 0.020269528943936858], ["played", 0.01972869983803458], ["half", 0.01922797029645538], ["wrong", 0.018761802245867872], ["serious", 0.018761802245867872], ["piece", 0.018325731157100497], ["turned", 0.016488341187616436], ["death", 0.014307439888541764], ["better", 0.013856822493280466], ["times", 0.012481153876785602], ["human", 0.011490589861975636], ["house", 0.011044927917436463], ["told", 0.011044927917436463], ["long", 0.00998286316390665], ["going", 0.009624012992866459], ["man", 0.009394948454517259]], "sentiment": ["Somebody suggests that everybody go into the pub to have a drink.

Utterson asks him if his research involves bombs. Jekyll says he has discovered a means of controlling human character with chemicals. Utterson says this is more dangerous than bombs.

He confesses that he turned himself into Hyde many times, and that he isn\u2019t going to do it anymore, that Hyde is dead. \u201cNo harmful side effects?\u201d says Utterson.
