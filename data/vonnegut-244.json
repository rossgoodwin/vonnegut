Gelhorne, and his know-how.\nPaul took a step down the path, which turned off the lights, and headed back toward the bonfire, which was sending sparks and flames up hundreds of feet and turning the faces about it to a sweaty pink.\nA professional actor, painted bronze, wearing an eagle-feather war bonnet and a beaded G-string, held up his hand and tilted his head back proudly. The crowd fell silent. \u201cHow!\u201d He looked earnestly from face to face. \u201cHow! Many moons ago, my people made their home on this island.\u201d\nThe amphibian was circling the island now, coming lower.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Old Man all right,\u201d whispered Kroner to Paul. \u201cWouldn\u2019t look good to walk out on the ceremony, though. We\u2019ll have to stick it out.\u201d\n\u201cMy people were brave people,\u201d said the Indian. \u201cMy people were proud and honest people. My people worked hard, played hard, fought hard, until it was time to go to the Happy Hunting Ground.\u201d\nThe same actor had been hired to play the Indian for years, ever since Paul had been coming to the Meadows. He\u2019d been hired originally for his deep voice and beautiful muscles. Now, Paul noticed, his belly cast a shadow over his G-string, his left calf had developed a varicose vein, and war paint failed to hide the gray bags under his eyes. He had become such a regular at the Meadows, such a vital symbol\u2014surpassed in that function only by Doctor Gelhorne and the Oak\u2014that he was a man apart from the other hired help, on a first-name footing with the brass, and with the drinking privileges of a regular guest.\n\u201cNow our braves are gone, our strong young men\u2014gone from this island, which belonged to my people, lo, these many moons ago,\u201d said the Indian. \u201cNow other young men come. But the spirit of my people lives on, the Spirit of the Meadows. It is everywhere: in the wind through the pines, in the lapping of the great blue water, in the whir of an eagle wing, in the growl of summer thunder. No man can call this island his, no man can be happy here, who does not harken to the Spirit, who does not take the Oath of the Spirit.\u201d\nThere was the clattering of the switch in the loudspeaker again. \u201cYoung braves at the Meadows for the first step forward,\u201d said a pontifical voice, not that of the usual drover.\n\u201cRaise your right hands,\u201d said the Indian. \u201cRepeat after me the Oath of the Spirit of the Meadows.

have considered my life at a satisfactory end, with all debts paid. I would have wound up on skid row, or maybe I would have been a suicide.\u201d He shrugged and smiled sadly. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cif I\u2019m ever going to square things with her, I\u2019ve got to believe in a Heaven, I\u2019ve got to believe she can look down and see me, and I\u2019ve got to be a big success for her to see.\u201d\nThis was profoundly satisfying to Henry and Anne\u2014and to Karpinsky, too.\nThree days later, Henry told Anne he loved her. Anne told him she loved him, too. They had told each other that before, but this was the first time it had meant a little something. They had finally seen a little something of life.\nTHE GOOD EXPLAINER\nThe office of Dr. Leonard Abekian was in a bad part of Chicago. It was behind a false front of yellow brick and glass block built out from the first floor of a narrow Victorian mansion whose spine was spiked with lightning rods. Joe Cunningham, treasurer of a bank in a small town outside of Cincinnati, arrived at Dr. Abekian\u2019s office by taxicab. He had spent the night in a hotel. Joe had come all the way from Ohio, under the impression that Dr. Abekian had had phenomenal successes in curing sterility. Joe was thirty-five. He had been married ten years without fathering a child.\nThe waiting room was not impressive. Its walls were goose-fleshed pink Spackle. Its furnishings were cracked leatherette and chromium-plated tubes. Joe had to put down a feeling that the office gave him at once\u2014a feeling that Dr. Abekian was a cheap quack. The air of the place was little more impressive than a barbershop\u2019s. Joe put down the feeling, told himself that Dr. Abekian was too absorbed in his work and too little interested in money to put up an impressive front.\nThere was no nurse or receptionist at the waiting room desk. The only other soul in the room was a boy about fourteen years old. He had his arm in a sling. The nature of this solitary patient disturbed Joe, too. He had expected to find the waiting room filled with people like himself\u2014\u2014childless people who had traveled great distances to see the famous Dr. Abekian, to get the final word on what the trouble was.\n\u201cIs\u2014is the doctor in?\u201d Joe asked the boy.\n\u201cRing the bell,\u201d said the boy.", 0.10555555555555554], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["vermilion", 0.18873456181007497], ["stedman", 0.17952893147913995], ["thrusts", 0.14382686407840356], ["clump", 0.14382686407840356], ["sylvia", 0.11892575132067024], ["glad", 0.11580720426845453], ["lazarro", 0.11023184672401272], ["mountain", 0.10202328193725808], ["indian", 0.08981539546334288], ["cornelia", 0.07720480284563637], ["cottage", 0.07527992045203319], ["erected", 0.07191343203920178], ["glumly", 0.07191343203920178], ["thoughtless", 0.07191343203920178], ["frisky", 0.07191343203920178], ["flicking", 0.07191343203920178], ["sketched", 0.07191343203920178], ["fingertip", 0.07191343203920178], ["beak", 0.06291152060335833], ["hm", 0.06291152060335833], ["worm", 0.06291152060335833], ["birch", 0.05764573997857697], ["eagle", 0.05764573997857697], ["kinds", 0.05764573997857697], ["trees", 0.05764573997857697], ["background", 0.05764573997857697], ["glazed", 0.05764573997857697], ["easel", 0.05764573997857697], ["created", 0.05764573997857697], ["indians", 0.05390960916751488], ["sunset", 0.05390960916751488], ["draw", 0.05101164096862904], ["raised", 0.04864382854273353], ["dozen", 0.04864382854273353], ["canvas", 0.04864382854273353], ["kids", 0.04864382854273353], ["bride", 0.04864382854273353], ["managed", 0.04664187166186004], ["brush", 0.04664187166186004], ["laughed", 0.04490769773167144], ["artist", 0.04490769773167144], ["stuff", 0.04490769773167144], ["fresh", 0.04490769773167144], ["paint", 0.043378047917952176], ["seconds", 0.042009729532785596], ["shut", 0.040771934989872284], ["ahead", 0.040771934989872284], ["red", 0.035905786295827996], ["side", 0.035905786295827996], ["bright", 0.03437613648210873], ["smile", 0.03437613648210873], ["picture", 0.031192727936225805], ["small", 0.027316195617316758], ["real", 0.026116542109121756], ["better", 0.02537422504626528], ["will", 0.02537422504626528], ["people", 0.022768112118185396], ["eyes", 0.02247625684737944], ["big", 0.01770061035224545]], "sentiment": ["\u201cHm?\u201d said Stedman.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you glad?\u201d she said.\n\u201cGlad?\u201d said Stedman.\n\u201cAbout how we\u2019re having out about who\u2019s the real artist?\u201d said Cornelia.\n\u201cGlad as can be,\u201d said Stedman.
