He was Vonnegut\u2019s first literary hero. Tarkington went to Princeton, where he founded the Triangle Club, and after he graduated returned to live in Indianapolis. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1919 for his novel The Magnificent Ambersons, which was later made as a movie by Orson Welles. His novel Penrod and Sam was compared with Mark Twain\u2019s Tom Sawyer.\nDear Harry:\nJust finished reading your pleasant letter of March 9. I was going to write you this morning anyway, to thank you for sending me money far ahead of the contract schedule. A generous and helpful thing to do, believe me.\nI seem to be out of the slick short story business completely. I can\u2019t do the trick anymore, and wasted 1953 grubbing around the inside of my silk hat for rabbits\u2014in vain.\nSo, as Ken told you, I\u2019ve become something much more important\u2014a playwright. Ken has one play now, and will have another in two weeks or so, and I can see two more past that. I\u2019m on a jag, after two dead years, and nothing nicer could possibly happen to a writer. A play jag. The philosophical restrictions of slick short stories finally whipped me. The formal restrictions of plays are delightful and stimulating.\nSure, Harry, I\u2019d love to have you look at the play Ken has now. I didn\u2019t know you were interested in plays. It\u2019s called Celeste, and I think maybe it\u2019s pretty funny. I grew up one block away from Booth Tarkington, and sang carols to the old man on Christmas Eve, 1945, a couple of months before he died. Celeste is Penrod and Sam brought up to date, in a way\u2014not like Mickey Rooney, and not like the Dead End Kids either.\nI haven\u2019t lost sight of the novel. I\u2019m pecking at it. I want to do it. It\u2019s more important to me than the plays\u2014but the plays offer me the last long shot I\u2019ve got at becoming solvent enough to become an honest literary man.", 0.19134316134316132], "title":

weren\u2019t science fiction at all. \u201cDr. Schadenfreude\u201d wasn\u2019t, unless one is humorless enough to regard psychiatry as a science. The one he deposited in the Academy\u2019s trash receptacle after \u201cDr. Schadenfreude,\u201d with the timequake drawing ever nearer, \u201cBunker Bingo Party,\u201d was a roman \u00e0 clef.\nThat one was set in Adolf Hitler\u2019s commodious bombproof bunker underneath the ruins of Berlin, Germany, at the end of World War Two in Europe. In that story, Trout calls his war, and my war, also, \u201cWestern Civilization\u2019s second unsuccessful attempt to commit suicide.\u201d He did that in conversations, too, one time adding in my presence, \u201cIf at first you don\u2019t succeed, try, try, please try again.\u201d\nTanks and infantry of the Soviet Union are only a few hundred yards away from the bunker\u2019s iron door up at street level. \u201cHitler, trapped below, the most loathsome human being who ever lived,\u201d wrote Trout, \u201cdoesn\u2019t know whether to shit or go blind. He is down there with his mistress Eva Braun and a few close friends, including Joseph Goebbels, his Minister of Propaganda, and Goebbels\u2019s wife and kids.\u201d\nFor want of anything else remotely decisive to do, Hitler proposes marriage to Eva. She accepts!\nAt this point in the story, Trout asked this rhetorical question, an aside with a paragraph all to itself:\n\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d\nEverybody forgets his or her troubles during the marriage ceremony. After the groom kisses the bride, though, the party goes flat again. \u201cGoebbels has a clubfoot,\u201d Trout wrote. \u201cBut Goebbels has always had a clubfoot. That is not the problem.\u201d\nGoebbels remembers that his kids have brought the game of Bingo with them. It was captured intact from American troops during the Battle of the Bulge some four months earlier. I myself was captured intact during that battle. Germany, in order to conserve its resources, has stopped making its own Bingo games. Because of that, and because the grownups in the bunker have been so busy during the rise of Hitler, and now his fall, the Goebbels kids are the only ones who know how the game is played. They learned from a neighbor kid, whose family owned a prewar Bingo set.\nThere is this amazing scene in the story: A boy and a girl, explaining the rules of Bingo, become the center of the Universe for Nazis in full regalia, including a gaga Adolf Hitler.", -0.003769841269841268], "title": "Timequake"}, "welcome-to-the-monkey-house": {"tfidf": [["nancy", 0.15156316442605264], ["cement", 0.13818940785426564], ["marlin", 0.07540503159944523], ["mosquitoes", 0.07239050834071724], ["women", 0.06433418858213864], ["companionway", 0.06383313574121174], ["bees", 0.06383313574121174], ["cabin", 0.06383313574121174], ["yachts", 0.06383313574121174], ["nightgown", 0.06383313574121174], ["perfume", 0.058827393665802315], ["pine", 0.058827393665802315], ["needle", 0.055275763141706256], ["blue", 0.05134423559703298], ["nothinghead", 0.05027002106629681], ["expected", 0.042786862997527486], ["bathroom", 0.04171264846679132], ["forward", 0.04171264846679132], ["kennedy", 0.03980955365410911], ["insects", 0.03619525417035862], ["windshield", 0.03619525417035862], ["violation", 0.03619525417035862], ["skipper", 0.03619525417035862], ["apartments", 0.03619525417035862], ["wirtanen", 0.03619525417035862], ["pantomimed", 0.03619525417035862], ["descended", 0.03619525417035862], ["froze", 0.03619525417035862], ["extinct", 0.03619525417035862], ["carly", 0.03619525417035862], ["crisscrossing", 0.03619525417035862], ["reeked", 0.03619525417035862], ["awakened", 0.03619525417035862], ["bridge", 0.03619525417035862], ["sting", 0.03619525417035862], ["tableau", 0.03619525417035862], ["hatch", 0.03619525417035862], ["footprints", 0.03619525417035862], ["pool", 0.03619525417035862], ["swarming", 0.03619525417035862], ["microcosm", 0.03619525417035862], ["sewer", 0.03619525417035862], ["sunk", 0.03191656787060587], ["birds", 0.03191656787060587], ["joseph", 0.03191656787060587], ["fully", 0.03191656787060587], ["fanned", 0.03191656787060587], ["delivered", 0.03191656787060587], ["candlelight", 0.03191656787060587], ["frank", 0.03191656787060587], ["geodesic", 0.03191656787060587], ["bath", 0.03191656787060587], ["awoke", 0.03191656787060587], ["sunlight", 0.03191656787060587], ["perfumed", 0.03191656787060587], ["escorted", 0.03191656787060587], ["bathed", 0.03191656787060587], ["argued", 0.029413696832901157], ["mate", 0.029413696832901157], ["dome", 0.029413696832901157], ["grass", 0.029413696832901157], ["actual", 0.029413696832901157], ["statues", 0.029413696832901157], ["ancient", 0.029413696832901157], ["admire", 0.029413696832901157], ["property", 0.029413696832901157], ["beach", 0.029413696832901157], ["statue", 0.029413696832901157], ["white", 0.029223748322612552], ["steam", 0.027637881570853128], ["paying", 0.027637881570853128], ["setting", 0.027637881570853128], ["stockings", 0.027637881570853128], ["manhole", 0.027637881570853128], ["dreamed", 0.02626045224175307], ["yellow", 0.02626045224175307], ["rise", 0.02626045224175307], ["direct", 0.02626045224175307], ["millions", 0.02626045224175307], ["museum", 0.02626045224175307], ["intelligence", 0.02626045224175307], ["bravely", 0.02626045224175307], ["dressed", 0.02626045224175307], ["wheel", 0.02626045224175307], ["dawn", 0.025135010533148407], ["barefoot", 0.025135010533148407], ["reach", 0.025135010533148407], ["harbor", 0.024183463126807307], ["steps", 0.024183463126807307], ["staring", 0.024183463126807307], ["heads", 0.024183463126807307], ["kennedys", 0.024183463126807307], ["downstairs", 0.024183463126807307], ["waist", 0.024183463126807307], ["perfect", 0.023359195271100374], ["belonged", 0.02263213949544369], ["quietly", 0.02263213949544369], ["wearing", 0.021981765942000315], ["led", 0.021393431498763743], ["locked", 0.021393431498763743], ["returned", 0.02085632423339566], ["lines", 0.02085632423339566], ["green", 0.02085632423339566], ["wet", 0.020362233445287408], ["stepped", 0.020362233445287408], ["dream", 0.019904776827054556], ["filled", 0.01908050897134763], ["attention", 0.01908050897134763], ["standing", 0.01908050897134763], ["thin", 0.01908050897134763], ["sleep", 0.01870628291075235], ["billy", 0.017703079642247568], ["poor", 0.017703079642247568], ["hour", 0.017703079642247568], ["weren", 0.017703079642247568], ["water", 0.017114745199010992], ["closed", 0.01657763793364291], ["thinking", 0.016325650313147505], ["moment", 0.01520020860454285], ["high", 0.014997802290820685], ["air", 0.014248661198201748], ["twenty", 0.01390563742564119], ["son", 0.013741018616492046], ["floor", 0.013741018616492046], ["house", 0.011130791142294308], ["three", 0.010921522304790102], ["will", 0.009069024820528754], ["time", 0.006440429691315186]], "sentiment": ["What awakened Nancy was a dream of mosquitoes and bees. Mosquitoes and bees were extinct. So were birds. But Nancy dreamed that millions of insects were swarming about her from the waist down. They didn\u2019t sting. They fanned her. Nancy was a nothinghead.\nShe went to sleep again. When she awoke next time, she was being led into a bathroom by three women, still with stockings over their heads. The bathroom was already filled with the steam from somebody else\u2019s bath. There were somebody else\u2019s wet footprints crisscrossing the floor and the air reeked of pine-needle perfume.\nHer will and intelligence returned as she was bathed and perfumed and dressed in a white nightgown. When the women stepped back to admire her, she said to them quietly, \"I may be a nothinghead now. But that doesn\u2019t mean I have to think like one or act like one.\"\nNobody argued with her.\nNancy was taken downstairs and out of the house. She fully expected to be sent down a manhole again. It would be the perfect setting for her violation by Billy, she was thinking\u2014 down in a sewer.\nBut they took her across the green cement, where the grass used to be, and then across the yellow cement, where the beach used to be, and then out onto the blue cement, where the harbor used to be. There were twenty-six yachts that had belonged to various Kennedys, sunk up to their water lines in blue cement. It was to the most ancient of these yachts, the Marlin, once the property of Joseph P. Kennedy, that they delivered Nancy.\nIt was dawn. Because of the high-rise apartments all around the Kennedy Museum, it would be an hour before any direct sunlight would reach the microcosm under the geodesic dome.\nNancy was escorted as far as the companionway to the forward cabin of the Marlin. The women pantomimed that she was expected to go down the five steps alone.\nNancy froze for the moment and so did the women. And there were two actual statues in the tableau on the bridge. Standing at the wheel was a statue of Frank Wirtanen, once skipper of the Marlin. And next to him was his son and first mate, Carly. They weren\u2019t paying any attention to poor Nancy. They were staring out through the windshield at the blue cement.\nNancy, barefoot and wearing a thin white nightgown, descended bravely into the forward cabin, which was a pool of candlelight and pine-needle perfume.

She had met Mrs. Roosevelt, and she would tell her grandchildren about it, and everything for her was downhill now. Nothing that important could ever happen to her again.\nThe front doorbell rang. The great carriage-house doors had of course been closed and bolted after the fiasco with poor Celia Hildreth the year before. We had an ordinary front door again.\nSo I answered the door. Mother and Father never answered the door. It was police chief Morissey out there. He looked very unhappy and secretive. He told me that he didn\u2019t want to come in, and he particularly didn\u2019t want to disturb my mother\u2014so I was to tell Father to come out for a talk with him. He said I should be in on it, too.\nI give my word of honor: I had not the slightest inkling of what the trouble might be.\nSo I got Father. He and Chief Morissey and I were going to do some more man business, business that women might be better off not hearing about. They might not understand. I was drying my hands on a tea towel.\nAnd Morissey himself, as I know now but didn\u2019t know then, had accidentally killed August Gunther with a firearm when he was young.\nAnd he said quietly to Father and me that Eloise Metzger, the pregnant wife of the city editor of the Bugle-Observer, George Metzger, had just been shot dead while running a vacuum cleaner in the guest room on the second floor of her home over on Harrison Avenue, about eight blocks away. There was a bullet hole in the window.\nHer family downstairs had become worried when the vacuum cleaner went on running and running without being dragged around at all.\nChief Morissey said that Mrs. Metzger couldn\u2019t have felt any pain, since the bullet got her right between the eyes. She never knew what hit her.\nThe bullet had been recovered from the guest-room floor, and it was virtually undamaged, thanks to its copper jacket, in spite of all it had been through.", 0.09268398268398269], "title": "Deadeye Dick"}, "mother-night": {"tfidf": [["bloom", 0.24650772734789458], ["arts", 0.16151628380665312], ["civilizations", 0.12325386367394729], ["sincere", 0.12325386367394729], ["roses", 0.12325386367394729], ["daisies", 0.12325386367394729], ["future", 0.09856594707466394], ["scene", 0.0921011814015902], ["plays", 0.07952554571764812], ["dump", 0.061626931836973646], ["unjust", 0.061626931836973646], ["artists", 0.061626931836973646], ["autumn", 0.061626931836973646], ["quality", 0.061626931836973646], ["knees", 0.061626931836973646], ["feasting", 0.061626931836973646], ["spits", 0.061626931836973646], ["indignation", 0.061626931836973646], ["creations", 0.061626931836973646], ["spitting", 0.061626931836973646], ["judge", 0.061626931836973646], ["judged", 0.061626931836973646], ["vapid", 0.061626931836973646], ["uninteresting", 0.061626931836973646], ["performing", 0.061626931836973646], ["archaeologist", 0.061626931836973646], ["supreme", 0.05383876126888437], ["indignant", 0.05383876126888437], ["miraculously", 0.05383876126888437], ["season", 0.05383876126888437], ["apiece", 0.05383876126888437], ["weep", 0.05383876126888437], ["excited", 0.05383876126888437], ["contempt", 0.04928297353733197], ["dozen", 0.04928297353733197], ["preserved", 0.04928297353733197], ["forward", 0.04928297353733197], ["step", 0.04928297353733197], ["fall", 0.04928297353733197], ["oysters", 0.04928297353733197], ["finds", 0.04928297353733197], ["ashamed", 0.0460505907007951], ["extent", 0.0460505907007951], ["art", 0.0435433597871523], ["eager", 0.0435433597871523], ["realize", 0.0435433597871523], ["works", 0.0435433597871523], ["hero", 0.0414948029692427], ["painter", 0.0414948029692427], ["marvelous", 0.03976277285882406], ["copies", 0.03976277285882406], ["late", 0.03976277285882406], ["held", 0.03826242013270583], ["um", 0.03826242013270583], ["government", 0.035755189219063024], ["matter", 0.035755189219063024], ["will", 0.03489823147789504], ["year", 0.034684288322385216], ["writer", 0.03370663240115342], ["idea", 0.03197460229073479], ["alive", 0.030474249564616557], ["city", 0.02854334780139567], ["write", 0.02796701865097375], ["better", 0.026896117754295946], ["men", 0.025459787737330944], ["howard", 0.023792147230384055], ["young", 0.022686078996527283], ["long", 0.022686078996527283], ["man", 0.022385630646258765], ["thought", 0.022340330022743535], ["night", 0.022004903470499926], ["kraft", 0.020755177233306395], ["going", 0.019366256379742614], ["american", 0.018130291264974875], ["told", 0.01744911573894752]], "sentiment": ["\u201cIt\u2019s so unjust!\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me ashamed to be an American!

There is no why.\u201d\nThey introduced an anesthetic into Billy\u2019s atmosphere now, put him to sleep. They carried him to a cabin where he was strapped to a yellow Barca-Lounger which they had stolen from a Sears Roebuck warehouse. The hold of the saucer was crammed with other stolen merchandise, which would be used to furnish Billy\u2019s artificial habitat in a zoo on Tralfamadore.\nThe terrific acceleration of the saucer as it left Earth twisted Billy\u2019s slumbering body, distorted his face, dislodged him in time, sent him back to the war.\nWhen he regained consciousness, he wasn\u2019t on the flying saucer. He was in a boxcar crossing Germany again.\nSome people were rising from the floor of the car, and others were lying down. Billy planned to lie down, too. It would be lovely to sleep. It was black in the car, and black outside the car, which seemed to be going about two miles an hour. The car never seemed to go any faster than that. It was a long time between clicks, between joints in the track. There would be a click, and then a year would go by, and then there would be another click.\nThe train often stopped to let really important trains bawl and hurtle by. Another thing it did was stop on sidings near prisons, leaving a few cars there. It was creeping across all of Germany, growing shorter all the time.\nAnd Billy let himself down oh so gradually now, hanging onto the diagonal cross-brace in the corner in order to make himself seem nearly weightless to those he was joining on the floor. He knew it was important that he make himself nearly ghostlike when lying down.

It had a thirty-one-story building for its home. While Magnum Opus owned the whole building, it used only the top three floors, renting out the rest to corporations it controlled.\nSome of these corporations, having been sold recently by Magnum Opus, were moving out. Others, having been bought recently by Magnum Opus, were moving in.\nAmong the tenants were Galactic Spacecraft, Moon-Mist Tobacco, Fandango Petroleum, Lennox Monorail, Fry-Kwik, Sani-Maid Pharmaceuticals, Lewis and Marvin Sulfur, Dupree Electronics, Universal Piezoelectric, Psychokinesis Unlimited, Ed Muir Associates, Max-Mor Machine Tools, Wilkinson Paint and Varnish, American Levitation, Flo-Fast, King O\u2019Leisure Shirts, and the Emblem Supreme Casualty and Life Assurance Company of California.\nThe Magnum Opus Building was a slender, prismatic, twelve-sided shaft, faced on all twelve sides with blue-green glass that shaded to rose at the base. The twelve sides were said by the architect to represent the twelve great religions of the world. So far, no one had asked the architect to name them.\nThat was lucky, because he couldn\u2019t have done it.\nThere was a private heliport on top.\nThe shadow and flutter of Constant\u2019s helicopter settling to the heliport seemed to many of the people below to be like the shadow and flutter of the Bright Angel of Death.

women\u2019s school on the edge of Lexington. Well in advance of my appearance, a Kentucky artist, Joe Petro III, son of the Kentucky artist Joe Petro II, asked me to do a black-and-white self-portrait, which he could then use in silk-screen posters to be used by the school. So I did and he did. Joe was only thirty-seven back then, and I was a mere spring chicken of only seventy-one, not even twice his age.\nWhen I got down there to speak, and was so happy about the posters, I learned from Joe himself that he painted romantic but scientifically precise pictures of wildlife, from which he made silk screen images. He had majored in zoology at the University of Tennessee. Yes, and some of his pictures were so appealing and informative that they had been used as propaganda by Greenpeace, an organization trying, with scant success so far, to prevent the murder of species, even our own, by the way we live now. And Joe, having shown me the poster and his own work and his studio, said to me in effect, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we keep on going?\u201d\nAnd so we have, and it seems quite possible in retrospect that Joe Petro III saved my life. I will not explain. I will let it go at that.\nWe have since collaborated on more than two hundred different images, with Joe making editions, signed and numbered by me, of ten or more of each of them. The \u201csamplers\u201d in this book are not at all representative of our total oeuvre, but are simply very recent jeux d\u2019esprit. Most of our stuff has been my knockoffs of Paul Klee and Marcel Duchamp and so on.\nAnd since we first met, Joe has beguiled others into sending him pictures for him to do with what he so much loves to do. Among them are the comedian Jonathan Winters, an art student long ago, and the English artist Ralph Steadman, whose accomplishments include the appropriately harrowing illustrations for Hunter Thompson\u2019s Fear and Loathing books. And Steadman and I have come to know and like each other on account of Joe.\nYes, and last July (2004) there was an exhibition of Joe\u2019s and my stuff, arranged by Joe, at the Indianapolis Art Center in the town of my birth. But there was also a painting by my architect and painter grandfather Bernard Vonnegut, and two by my architect and painter father Kurt Vonnegut, and six apiece by my daughter Edith and my son the doctor Mark.\nRalph Steadman heard about this family show from Joe and sent me a note of congratulation. I wrote him back as follows: \u201cJoe Petro III staged a reunion of four generations of my family in Indianapolis, and he has made you and me feel like first cousins. Is it possible that he is God? We could do worse.\u201d\nOnly kidding, of course.\nAre Origami\u2019s pictures any good? Well, I asked the now regrettably dead painter Syd Solomon, a most agreeable neighbor on Long Island for many summertimes, how to tell a good picture from a bad one. He gave me the most satisfactory answer I ever expect to hear. He said, \u201cLook at a million pictures, and you can never be mistaken.\u201d\nI passed this on to my daughter Edith, a professional painter, and she too thought it was pretty good. She said she \u201ccould rollerskate through the Louvre, saying, \u2018Yes, no, no, yes, no, yes,\u2019 and so on.\u201d", 0.15637100168350168], "title": "A Man without a Country"}, "palm-sunday":

Writers are unlucky speakers, by and large, which accounts for their being in a profession which encourages them to stay at their desks for years, if necessary, pondering what to say next and how best to say it. Interviewers propose to speed up this process by trepaning writers, so to speak, and fishing around in their brains for unused ideas which otherwise might never get out of there. Not a single idea has ever been discovered by means of this brutal method\u2014and still the trepaning of authors goes on every day.\nI now refuse all those who wish to take the top off my skull yet again. The only way to get anything out of a writer\u2019s brains is to leave him or her alone until he or she is damn well ready to write it down.\nThis interview is purely written. Not a word of it was spoken aloud. The prefatory material in italics was not written by me, however, but by The Paris Review, to wit:\nThe introduction to the first of the incorporated interviews (done in West Barnstable, Massachusetts, when Vonnegut was 44) reads: \u201cHe is a veteran and a family man, large-boned, loose-jointed, at ease. He camps in an armchair in a shaggy tweed jacket, Cambridge gray flannels, a blue Brooks Brothers shirt, slouched down, his hands stuffed into his pockets. He shells the interview with explosive coughs and sneezes, windages of an autumn cold and a lifetime of heavy cigarette smoking. His voice is a resonant baritone, Midwestern, wry in its inflections. From time to time he issues the open alert smile of a man who has seen and reserved within himself almost everything: depression, war, the possibility of violent death, the inanities of corporate public relations, six children, an irregular income, long-delayed recognition.\u201d\nThe last of the interviews which made up the composite was conducted during the summer of 1916, years after the first. The description of him at this time reads:\u201d\u2026 he moves with the low-keyed amiability of an old family dog. In general, his appearance is tousled: the long curly hair, moustache and sympathetic smile suggest a man at once amused and saddened by the world around him. He has rented the Gerald Murphy house for the summer. He works in the little bedroom at the end of a hall where Murphy, artist, bon vivant, and friend to the artistic great, died in 1964. From his desk Vonnegut can look out onto the front lawn through a small window; behind him is a large, white canopy bed. On the desk next to the typewriter is a copy of Andy Warhol\u2019s Interview, Clancy Sigal\u2019s Zone of the Interior, and several discarded cigarette packs.\n\u201cVonnegut has chain-smoked Pall Malls since 1936 and during the course of the interview he smokes the better part of one pack. His voice is low and gravelly, and as he speaks, the incessant procedure of lighting the cigarettes and exhaling smoke is like punctuation in his conversation. Other distractions such as the jangle of the telephone, and the barking of a small, shaggy dog named \u2019Pumpkin,\u2019 do not detract from Vonnegut\u2019s good-natured disposition. Indeed, as Dan Wakefield once said of his fellow Shortridge High School alumnus: \u2019He laughed a lot and was kind to everyone.\u2019\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nINTERVIEWER: You are a veteran of the Second World War?\nVONNEGUT: Yes. I want a military funeral when I die\u2014the bugler, the flag on the casket, the ceremonial firing squad, the hallowed ground.\nINTERVIEWER: Why?", 0.07064026251526251], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["charley", 0.27299469514957964], ["ned", 0.18792895246405983], ["drink", 0.12301235069201419], ["robert", 0.09434949726226358], ["third", 0.08142553908240177], ["opening", 0.07807443734702658], ["doorway", 0.07807443734702658], ["wrong", 0.06635712211370731], ["tempted", 0.060188415945853654], ["frowsy", 0.060188415945853654], ["saluting", 0.060188415945853654], ["intended", 0.060188415945853654], ["sooner", 0.060188415945853654], ["cooperate", 0.060188415945853654], ["jamb", 0.060188415945853654], ["ceremonious", 0.060188415945853654], ["join", 0.060188415945853654], ["widened", 0.060188415945853654], ["gulps", 0.060188415945853654], ["nancy", 0.05318025681870044], ["brave", 0.052654207461506425], ["playfully", 0.052654207461506425], ["ideas", 0.052654207461506425], ["innkeeper", 0.052654207461506425], ["holmes", 0.048246978025548115], ["framed", 0.048246978025548115], ["busy", 0.048246978025548115], ["drank", 0.048246978025548115], ["highly", 0.048246978025548115], ["fancy", 0.045119998977159195], ["watched", 0.045119998977159195], ["counting", 0.045119998977159195], ["crashing", 0.045119998977159195], ["worried", 0.045119998977159195], ["ryan", 0.045119998977159195], ["three", 0.040734187410628044], ["worry", 0.040712769541200886], ["uncle", 0.040712769541200886], ["fast", 0.03903721867351329], ["speech", 0.03903721867351329], ["scared", 0.037585790492811966], ["perfect", 0.037585790492811966], ["quick", 0.036305540105242576], ["moving", 0.03516031710896186], ["exactly", 0.034124336893697454], ["glass", 0.034124336893697454], ["death", 0.033178561056853656], ["shoulder", 0.033178561056853656], ["course", 0.030051582008464733], ["side", 0.030051582008464733], ["happy", 0.028771331620895346], ["feet", 0.028183644433174955], ["husband", 0.028183644433174955], ["full", 0.025200635240764522], ["stood", 0.02477432314127233], ["high", 0.024364102184937036], ["men", 0.023218879188656318], ["wouldn", 0.023218879188656318], ["small", 0.02286246807101511], ["boy", 0.021858410243504076], ["day", 0.021543328320968728], ["man", 0.02026443654414011], ["people", 0.019055919925002992], ["wasn", 0.017886021401172934], ["door", 0.01766642675641729], ["thing", 0.016053165831218665], ["looked", 0.014983165039770268], ["big", 0.014814641273074995]], "sentiment": ["\u201cJoin the boy and me in a drink, Ned?\u201d said Charley playfully.\n\u201cI\u2019m tempted,\u201d said Ned, \u201cbut I\u2019m scared to death the world wouldn\u2019t cooperate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat could go wrong?\u201d said Charley.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, and neither do you,\u201d said Ned. \u201cBut it\u2019s an awfully busy world out there, full of fast-moving people with big, fancy ideas of their own. No sooner would we get that first drink down, counting on a perfect day, and somebody would come crashing in here and say or do exactly the wrong thing.\u201d\nAt the end of this speech, Ned intended to take Charley\u2019s drink away from him. But he wasn\u2019t quick enough. Before he could do it, Charley was on his feet, his glass on high, saluting Robert, who stood in the doorway.\nIn three brave, highly ceremonious gulps, Charley drank the drink down.\nNancy Holmes Ryan watched Charley do it through the small opening between her husband\u2019s shoulder and the door-jamb.

What he wrote now was the name of the suicidal man who had called him, who had come to see him, who had just departed\u2014departed a little sulkily, as though suspecting that he had been swindled or mocked, but couldn't imagine how or why.\n\"Sherman Wesley Little,\" wrote Eliot. \"Indy, Su-TDM-LO-V2-W3K3-K2CP-RF $300.\" Decoded, this meant that Little was from Indianapolis, was a suicidal tool-and-die maker who had been laid off, a veteran of the Second World War with a wife and three children, the second child suffering from cerebral palsy. Eliot had awarded him a Rosewater Fellowship of $300.\nA prescription that was far more common than money in the Domesday Book was \"AW.\" This represented Eliot's recommendation to people who were down in the dumps for every reason and for no reason in particular: \"Dear, I tell you what to do\u2014 take an aspirin tablet, and wash it down with a glass of wine.\"\n\"FH\" stood for \"Fly Hunt.\" People often felt a desperate need to do something nice for Eliot. He would ask them to come at a specific time in order to rid his office of flies. During the fly season, this was an Augean task, for Eliot had no screens on his windows, and his office, moreover, was connected directly to the foul kitchen of the lunchroom below by means of a greasy hot-air register in the floor.\nSo the fly hunts were actually rituals, and were ritualized to such an extent that conventional fly-swatters were not used, and men and women hunted flies in very different ways. The men used rubber bands, and the women used tumblers of lukewarm water and soapsuds.\nThe rubber-band technique worked like this: A man would slice through a rubber band, making it a strand rather than a loop. He would stretch the strand between his hands, sight down the strand as though it were a rifle barrel, let it snap when a fly was in his sights. A well-hit fly would often be vaporized, accounting for the peculiar color of Eliot's walls and woodwork, which was largely dried fly pur\u00e9e.\nThe tumbler-and-soapsuds technique worked like this: A woman would look for a fly hanging upside down. She would then bring her tumbler of suds directly under the fly very slowly, taking advantage of the fact that an upside-down fly, when approached by danger, will drop straight down two inches or more, in a free fall, before using his wings. Ideally, the fly would not sense danger until it was directly below him, and he would obligingly drop into the suds to be caught, to work his way down through the bubbles, to drown.\nOf this technique Eliot often said: \"Nobody believes it until she tries it. Once she finds out it works, she never wants to quit.\"", 0.16146749084249085], "title": "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"}, "jailbird": {"tfidf": [["interest", 0.16861906247674488], ["checks", 0.13903167707205233], ["country", 0.11782533110602976], ["ponzi", 0.11012082737025995], ["millionaire", 0.10255024651626574], ["greatest", 0.10255024651626574], ["opportunities", 0.09188011209236667], ["scheme", 0.09188011209236667], ["sir", 0.07843733251957744], ["money", 0.07174215102387876], ["recipients", 0.06951583853602616], ["utter", 0.06951583853602616], ["rolls", 0.06951583853602616], ["rates", 0.06951583853602616], ["convictions", 0.06951583853602616], ["consisting", 0.06951583853602616], ["inevitably", 0.06951583853602616], ["returning", 0.06951583853602616], ["gloatingly", 0.06951583853602616], ["castastrophic", 0.06951583853602616], ["swindler", 0.06951583853602616], ["royces", 0.06951583853602616], ["communist", 0.06776719809567838], ["strength", 0.06039548089707951], ["mansions", 0.06039548089707951], ["speedboats", 0.06039548089707951], ["convinced", 0.06039548089707951], ["youthful", 0.06039548089707951], ["forget", 0.055060413685129976], ["satisfied", 0.055060413685129976], ["sanza", 0.055060413685129976], ["di", 0.055060413685129976], ["stupidity", 0.055060413685129976], ["fools", 0.055060413685129976], ["mistake", 0.055060413685129976], ["offering", 0.05127512325813287], ["successful", 0.05127512325813287], ["enormous", 0.045940056046183335], ["write", 0.04391175762740362], ["fool", 0.04391175762740362], ["understand", 0.04391175762740362], ["third", 0.04391175762740362], ["buy", 0.04215476561918622], ["start", 0.03921866625978872], ["promised", 0.03681969840723669], ["america", 0.03388359904783919], ["live", 0.031484631195287154], ["remember", 0.031484631195287154], ["ago", 0.030773220389099316], ["dr", 0.030098308620842073], ["simply", 0.02945633277650744], ["matter", 0.027699340768290035], ["high", 0.026149563983337624], ["heard", 0.021652862750152664], ["times", 0.02131108003432029], ["thing", 0.020977950981895425], ["will", 0.01885600167142013], ["long", 0.018578983129343387], ["people", 0.01137319895975514], ["time", 0.009053735244781562]], "sentiment": ["\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever forget one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what this country does to you, it is still the greatest country in the world.

His last words had been, \u201cSee the Nigger fly the airplane.\u201d\n10\nSOMETIMES ALTON DARWIN would talk to me about the planet he was on before he was transported in a steel box to Athena. \u201cDrugs were food,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in the food business. Just because people on one planet eat a certain kind of food they\u2019re hungry for, that makes them feel better after they eat it, that doesn\u2019t mean people on other planets shouldn\u2019t eat something else. On some planets I\u2019m sure there are people who eat stones, and then feel wonderful for a little while afterwards. Then it\u2019s time to eat stones again.\u201d\nI THOUGHT VERY little about the prison during the 15 years I was a teacher at Tarkington, as big and brutal as it was across the lake, and growing all the time. When we went picnicking at the head of the lake, or went up to Rochester on some errand or other, I saw plenty of blacked-out buses and steel boxes on the backs of trucks. Alton Darwin might have been in one of those boxes. Then again, since the steel boxes were also used to carry freight, there might have been nothing but Diet Pepsi and toilet paper in there.\nWhatever was in there was none of my business until Tarkington fired me.\nSOMETIMES WHEN I was playing the bells and getting particularly loud echoes from the prison walls, usually in the dead of the wintertime, I would have the feeling that I was shelling the prison. In Vietnam, conversely, if I happened to be back with the artillery, and the guns were lobbing shells at who knows what in some jungle, it seemed very much like music, interesting noises for the sake of interesting noises, and nothing more.\nDURING A SUMMER field exercise when Jack Patton and I were still cadets, I remember, we were asleep in a tent and the artillery opened up nearby.\nWe awoke. Jack said to me, \u201cThey\u2019re playing our tune, Gene. They\u2019re playing our tune.\u201d\nBEFORE I WENT to work at Athena, I had seen only 3 convicts anywhere in the valley.
