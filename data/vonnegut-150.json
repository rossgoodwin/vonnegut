brother and eventually their descendents from want and obscurity. She sent herself to the University of Wisconsin, and took a master\u2019s degree in the classics. Her thesis was a high school textbook on the Latin and Greek roots of common words in English. It was adopted by many school systems all over the country, and earned enough money to enable Riah to put her brother through medical school. He set up practice in Hollywood, and became the beloved obstetrician of many famous movie stars.\nShe married a lawyer in Indianapolis who did not make much money. She took jobs teaching Latin and Greek and English, and became the Indianapolis representative for touring lecturers and musicians. She also sold silly, witty short stories to magazines from time to time. Thus was she able to send her son and daughter to the best private schools, even during the Great Depression. Her daughter became a Phi Beta Kappa at Swarthmore.\nShe died three years ago, and is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, somewhere between John Dillinger, the bank robber, and James Whitcomb Riley, the \u201cHoosier Poet.\u201d I liked her a lot. She was a good friend of mine. She was my first mother-in-law.\nI mention her in this chapter on obscenity because she imagined that I used certain impolite words in my books in order to cause a sensation, in order to make the books more popular. She told me as a friend that the words were having the opposite effect in her circle of friends, at least. Her friends could not bear to read me anymore.\nIndianapolis Magazine said much the same thing in its article about me, from which I quoted in a previous chapter. It praised the themes of my early books, Player Piano, The Sirens of Titan, and Mother Night: \u201c\u2026 anger at war and killing, at the void that technology is creating in contemporary life.\u201d But it went on to say: \u201cFrom then on, though the themes remained constant, his style began to change. Small obscenities crept in, and four-letter words became frequent in Breakfast of Champions in a riot of indecorous line drawings and misbegotten words that were suggestive of a small boy sticking out his tongue at the teacher.\u201d\nThis small boy, sticking out his tongue, was fifty years old at the time. It has been many decades since I have wished to shock a teacher or anyone. I did want to make the Americans in my books talk as Americans really do talk. I wanted to make jokes about our bodies. Why not? Why not, I ask again, especially since Riah Fagan Cox, God rest her soul, assured me that she herself was not wobbled by dirty words.\nIf I had gone to Riah\u2019s friends, they would have told me, too, that they had heard all the dirty words I used many times before, that the words did not astonish them. They would have insisted that the words should not be published anyway. It was bad manners to use such words. Bad manners should be punished.\nBut even when I was in grammar school, I suspected that warnings about words that nice people never used were in fact lessons in how to keep our mouths shut not just about our bodies, but about many, many things\u2014perhaps too many things.\nWhen I was in the fourth grade or so, I had this hunch confirmed. My father hit me for my bad manners in front of guests. It was the only time either one of my parents ever hit me. I hadn\u2019t said \u201cshit\u201d or \u201cpiss\u201d or \u201cfart\u201d or \u201cfuck\u201d or anything like that in front of the guests. I had asked them a question in the field of economics. But my father was so offended by my question that I might as well have called the guests \u201csilly shitheads.\u201d They really were silly shitheads, by the way.\nThe Great Depression was going on. The year would have been 1932. I had been taken out of private school a couple of years before, so that my classmates were no longer the children of the rich and the powerful. They were the children of mechanics and clerks and mailmen and so on. I thought it was wonderful that their mothers could cook. That was more than my own mother could do. Also, their fathers could fart around with motors and so on. Peer pressure, which is the most powerful force in the universe, had actually made me a scorner of my parents\u2019 class.", 0.15571924603174603], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["antiwar", 0.0781024888379203], ["overseas", 0.06805687752545733], ["harvard", 0.0462586543837722], ["color", 0.04473169038873123], ["bonuses", 0.03905124441896015], ["lunacy", 0.03905124441896015], ["alien", 0.03905124441896015], ["rhetoric", 0.03905124441896015], ["monumental", 0.03905124441896015], ["nationals", 0.03905124441896015], ["standpoint", 0.03905124441896015], ["shipped", 0.03905124441896015], ["protests", 0.03905124441896015], ["confession", 0.03905124441896015], ["vainglorious", 0.03905124441896015], ["disaster", 0.03905124441896015], ["stare", 0.03905124441896015], ["shakers", 0.03905124441896015], ["earmarked", 0.03905124441896015], ["screwing", 0.03905124441896015], ["quagmire", 0.03905124441896015], ["60s", 0.03905124441896015], ["mission", 0.034028438762728666], ["surgical", 0.034028438762728666], ["denounce", 0.034028438762728666], ["gloved", 0.034028438762728666], ["gloves", 0.034028438762728666], ["benefit", 0.034028438762728666], ["masked", 0.034028438762728666], ["contrast", 0.034028438762728666], ["amazement", 0.034028438762728666], ["movers", 0.034028438762728666], ["economy", 0.034028438762728666], ["escapee", 0.034028438762728666], ["questions", 0.031090285805423123], ["coding", 0.031090285805423123], ["financial", 0.031090285805423123], ["32", 0.031090285805423123], ["corporations", 0.031090285805423123], ["population", 0.031090285805423123], ["tunnel", 0.031090285805423123], ["rubber", 0.031090285805423123], ["majority", 0.031090285805423123], ["coded", 0.031090285805423123], ["insisted", 0.031090285805423123], ["mask", 0.031090285805423123], ["japanese", 0.029809669849873873], ["state", 0.029809669849873873], ["vietnam", 0.029189712902684618], ["desk", 0.029005633106497175], ["odd", 0.029005633106497175], ["brothers", 0.029005633106497175], ["maximum", 0.029005633106497175], ["plans", 0.029005633106497175], ["shoot", 0.027388650850597104], ["minds", 0.027388650850597104], ["properties", 0.027388650850597104], ["native", 0.027388650850597104], ["development", 0.027388650850597104], ["machinery", 0.027388650850597104], ["retirement", 0.02606748014919164], ["study", 0.02606748014919164], ["experience", 0.02606748014919164], ["physical", 0.02606748014919164], ["peace", 0.02606748014919164], ["mental", 0.02495044623739991], ["putting", 0.02495044623739991], ["security", 0.02495044623739991], ["dangerous", 0.02495044623739991], ["whites", 0.02495044623739991], ["growing", 0.02495044623739991], ["male", 0.02495044623739991], ["corporation", 0.02495044623739991], ["interview", 0.02495044623739991], ["land", 0.02495044623739991], ["heaven", 0.023982827450265688], ["subject", 0.023982827450265688], ["hours", 0.023982827450265688], ["country", 0.022614932367063852], ["members", 0.022365845194365616], ["afternoon", 0.022365845194365616], ["middle", 0.022365845194365616], ["moment", 0.022365845194365616], ["simply", 0.021675191717522684], ["hand", 0.020464654872137424], ["feel", 0.019927640581168422], ["eyes", 0.019927640581168422], ["expected", 0.019927640581168422], ["light", 0.019927640581168422], ["matsumoto", 0.01942769223706008], ["bell", 0.01942769223706008], ["war", 0.019255488685073645], ["escaped", 0.0189600217940342], ["served", 0.01852071294029192], ["bought", 0.01852071294029192], ["states", 0.01852071294029192], ["united", 0.01852071294029192], ["wearing", 0.01810652153565461], ["black", 0.01782882096314245], ["afterward", 0.017343039538134132], ["case", 0.016989487623862883], ["weren", 0.016989487623862883], ["tower", 0.016652386061291196], ["inside", 0.016330271839763415], ["mind", 0.016330271839763415], ["warden", 0.01602186883672866], ["national", 0.015168368578349072], ["felt", 0.015168368578349072], ["money", 0.01465054999876831], ["student", 0.01465054999876831], ["shot", 0.01440488658082859], ["business", 0.01440488658082859], ["army", 0.014167279169067787], ["prison", 0.013716238743857745], ["break", 0.013287852669036863], ["school", 0.012503696258600394], ["year", 0.012320233881902643], ["3", 0.011966681967631395], ["valley", 0.011466733623523052], ["convicts", 0.01115162411671335], ["heard", 0.009882029268705447], ["lot", 0.0091444735128363], ["going", 0.008060910223191635], ["thought", 0.007960958613537027], ["people", 0.004924213974667874]], "sentiment": ["MY CONFESSION THAT I had served in Vietnam, to my amazement, made Warden Matsumoto feel that we were almost brothers! He came out from behind his desk to take me by the hand and stare into my eyes. It was an odd experience for me, simply from the physical standpoint, since he was wearing a surgical mask and rubber gloves.\n\u201cSo we both know what it is,\u201d he said, \u201cto be shipped to an alien land on a dangerous mission of vainglorious lunacy!\u201d\n32\nWHAT AN AFTERNOON!\nOnly 3 hours before, I had been so at peace in my bell tower. Now I was inside a maximum-security prison, with a masked and gloved Japanese national who insisted that the United States was his Vietnam!\nWhat is more, he had been in the middle of student antiwar protests over here when the Vietnam War was going on. His corporation had sent him to the Harvard Business School to study the minds of the movers and shakers who were screwing up our economy for their own immediate benefit, taking money earmarked for research and development and new machinery and so on, and putting it into monumental retirement plans and year-end bonuses for themselves.\nDuring our interview, he used all the antiwar rhetoric he had heard at Harvard in the \u201960s to denounce his own country\u2019s overseas disaster. We were a quagmire. There was no light at the end of the tunnel over here, and on and on.\nUntil that moment, I had not given a thought to the mental state of members of the ever-growing army of Japanese nationals in this country, who had to make a financial go of all the properties their corporations had bought out from under us.

When they arrived, they could see all the damage she had done, but she herself was roaming shoeless out in the night again. That is the second story I have told about Celia which ends with her fleeing barefoot.\nHistory repeats itself.\nThe police went looking for her\u2014to protect her. She could get robbed or raped. She could be attacked by dogs. She could be hit by a car.\nMeanwhile, I set about cleaning up the mess she had made. The store wasn\u2019t mine, so I was in no position to forgive and forget. Celia\u2019s husband was going to have to find out what she had done, and then he would be asked to cough up a thousand dollars or more. Celia had gone after the most expensive perfumes. Celia had gone after the watches, too, but they were still okay. It is virtually impossible to harm a Timex watch. For some reason, the less you pay for a watch, the surer you can be that it will never stop.\nMy conscience was active as I worked. Should I have hugged her or given her amphetamine? My feeling was that chemicals had wrecked her brains, and that she wasn\u2019t Celia Hoover anymore. She was a monster. If I did write a play for her new face, I thought, she wouldn\u2019t be able to learn her lines. Somebody else would have to play her\u2014in a fright wig, and with several teeth blacked out.\nWhat wonderful things could a writer put into the mouth of a crazy old lady like her anyway? My mind got this far with the problem, anyway: She could certainly shake up an audience if she let it think she was about a hundred years old for a while, and then told her true age. Celia was only forty-four when she took the drugstore apart.\nI tinkered, too, with the idea of having the voice of God coming from the back of the theater. Whoever played God would have to have a voice like my brother\u2019s.\nThe actress playing Celia could ask why God had ever put her on earth.\nAnd then the voice from the back of the theater could rumble: \u201cTo reproduce. Nothing else really interests Me.
