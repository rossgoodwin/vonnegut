This caused the chief judge to bang his gavel and declare that what those on trial had done was \u201cno laughing matter.\u201d What people found so funny was the prosecutor\u2019s description of what people did at the base when Joy\u2019s Pride came in for a landing with the purple motherfucker only a foot above the tarmac. People jumped out of windows. They peed in their pants.\n\u201cThere were all kinds of collisions between different kinds of vehicles,\u201d wrote Kilgore Trout.\nNo sooner had the judge restored order, though, than a huge crack opened in the floor of the Pacific Ocean. It swallowed Banalulu, court-martial, Joy\u2019s Pride, unused atom bomb and all.\n4\nWhen the excellent German novelist and graphic artist G\u00fcnter Grass heard that I was born in 1922, he said to me, \u201cThere are no males in Europe your age for you to talk to.\u201d He himself was a kid during Kilgore Trout\u2019s and my war, as were Elie Wiesel and Jerzy Kosinski and Milos Forman, and on and on. I was lucky to be born over here instead of over there, and white and middle-class, and into a house full of books and pictures, and into a large extended family, which exists no more.\nI heard the poet Robert Pinsky give a reading this summer, in which he apologized didactically for having had a much nicer life than normal. I should do that, too.\nAt least I seized the opportunity this past May to thank my birthplace, as a graduation speaker at Butler University.

Why should I have gone? I was only two. It was surely then that I formed the opinion that the servants were my closest relatives. I aspired to do what they did so well\u2014to cook and bake and wash dishes, and to make the beds and wash and iron and spade the garden, and so on.\nIt still makes me as happy as I can be to prepare a good meal in a house which, because of me, is sparkling clean.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI have no conscious memory of what my real relatives looked like when they came home from Germany.

But I have since seen photographs of them\u2014in a scrapbook Mother kept of those exciting days, and also in old copies of the Midland City Bugle-Observer. Mother is wearing a dirndl. Father is wearing lederhosen and knee socks. Felix, although technically not entitled to do so, since he never joined the organization, was wearing the khaki uniform and Sam Browne belt, and the armband with swastika and ornamental dagger of the Hitler Youth. Even if Felix had been a German boy, he would have been too young to wear an outfit like that, but Father had a tailor in Berlin make it up for him anyway.\nWhy not?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnd as soon as those relatives of mine got home, according to the paper, Father flew his favorite gift from Hitler from the horizontal shaft of the weather vane.

American letters, one without whom the very term American literature would mean much less than it does now. Vonnegut\u2019s other books from Seven Stories Press include the national bestseller A Man Without a Country and, with Lee Stringer, Like Shaking Hands with God: A Conversation About Writing.\nNEIL GAIMAN has written acclaimed books for both adults and younger readers, and has won many major awards, including the Hugo and Nebula. His novel The Graveyard Book was the only book to win both the Newbery (US) and Carnegie Medal (UK). His Times bestselling books include Coraline and Stardust (both adapted into films), American Gods, and Anansi Boys. His comics series The Sandman was described by the Los Angeles Times as \u201cthe greatest epic in the history of comic books.\nSEVEN STORIES PRESS is an independent book publisher based in NewYork City, with distribution throughout the United States, Canada, England, and Australia.

Butler, Ani DiFranco, Assia Djebar, Ariel Dorfman, Coco Fusco, Barry Gifford, Hwang Sok-yong, Peter Plate, Lee Stringer, and Kurt Vonnegut, to name a few, together with political titles by voices of conscience, including the Boston Women\u2019s Health Collective, Noam Chomsky, Angela Y. Davis, Human Rights Watch, Derrick Jensen, Ralph Nader, Loretta Napoleoni, Gary Null, Project Censored, Ted Rall, Barbara Seaman, Alice Walker, Gary Webb, and Howard Zinn, among many others.

We love him dearly, and I think he loves us, too, probably lots more than most fathers love their children. But golly, his idea of doing us a favor is to discipline us every time we turn around.\u201d A patch of light on the grass to their left, cast from Kitty\u2019s window above, disappeared. Hope and Haley looked up at the darkened window. \u201cGoing to bed early,\u201d said Hope. \u201cGuess she\u2019ll cry herself to sleep tonight.\u201d Suddenly she motioned for silence. \u201cListen!\u201d\nHaley heard a rustling in the untended barberry hedge bounding the driveway. A figure separated from the shadows, and Haley recognized Roy, who looked as though he had been eluding bloodhounds for a week. He spoke hoarsely, and he was visible for only a minute\u2014long enough to give them a note for Kitty, rumpled and moist from his perspiring hands. He retreated again into the hedge, and Hope ran upstairs with the message, leaving Haley alone on the kitchen steps. The light in Kitty\u2019s room flashed on again, and Haley turned his head to see her standing in the window, waving her hands and nodding. A moment later, he saw Roy head across the barnyard toward the highway, running between patches of shadows in a low crouch.\nHope returned, vibrant with excitement. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get married anyway, Haley\u2014tonight!\u201d\nHaley laughed nervously and found himself without adequate comment.\n\u201cAnd the wonderful thing about it is that we get to see them elope!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather keep out of it,\u201d said Haley, his voice tinged with anxiety.\n\u201cOh, but you can\u2019t,\u201d said Hope, enthusiastically. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely crucial.

which was waterproof. It had thirty-nine keys and two stops\u2014vox humana and vox celeste. Billy also had charge of a portable altar, an olive-drab attach\u00e9 case with telescoping legs. It was lined with crimson plush, and nestled in that passionate plush were an anodized aluminum cross and a Bible.\nThe altar and the organ were made by a vacuum-cleaner company in Camden, New Jersey\u2014and said so.\nOne time on maneuvers Billy was playing \u201cA Mighty Fortress Is Our God,\u201d with music by Johann Sebastian Bach and words by Martin Luther. It was Sunday morning. Billy and his chaplain had gathered a congregation of about fifty soldiers on a Carolina hillside. An umpire appeared. There were umpires everywhere, men who said who was winning or losing the theoretical battle, who was alive and who was dead.\nThe umpire had comical news. The congregation had been theoretically spotted from the air by a theoretical enemy. They were all theoretically dead now. The theoretical corpses laughed and ate a hearty noontime meal.\nRemembering this incident years later, Billy was struck by what a Tralfamadorian adventure with death that had been, to be dead and to eat at the same time.\nToward the end of maneuvers, Billy was given an emergency furlough home because his father, a barber in Ilium, New York, was shot dead by a friend while they were out hunting deer. So it goes.\nWhen Billy got back from his furlough, there were orders for him to go overseas. He was needed in the headquarters company of an infantry regiment fighting in Luxembourg. The regimental chaplain\u2019s assistant had been killed in action. So it goes.\nWhen Billy joined the regiment, it was in the process of being destroyed by the Germans in the famous Battle of the Bulge. Billy never even got to meet the chaplain he was supposed to assist, was never even issued a steel helmet and combat boots. This was in December of 1944, during the last mighty German attack of the war.\nBilly survived, but he was a dazed wanderer far behind the new German lines. Three other wanderers, not quite so dazed, allowed Billy to tag along. Two of them were scouts, and one was an antitank gunner. They were without food or maps. Avoiding Germans, they were delivering themselves into rural silences ever more profound. They ate snow.\nThey went Indian file. First came the scouts, clever, graceful, quiet. They had rifles.

Because of what was then believed to be a law of Nature, a Natural Law. Nature had obviously color-coded people for a reason. Otherwise, what the hell were all these different colors for?\nAnd why was Thomas Jefferson, possibly the most beloved of our founding fathers after George Washington, able to write \u201call men are created equal,\u201d while meaning only white males, not women, God knows, and while owning slaves? Because of what was then believed to be a law of Nature. Jefferson\u2019s slaves were mortgaged, by the way. What a shame that you can no longer take the cleaning lady, along with the saxophone, down to the hock shop, if you\u2019re short on cash. Those were sure the good old days.\nIn quite a few ways though, it was still the good old days for white males when I was growing up. I could still feel superior, even in the view of law-enforcement agencies, to half my own race and one hundred percent of all the others. That was comforting! Not only that, but I could get away with all kinds of crap because I was from a good family. But that\u2019s another story.\nIn our all-white sandlot football games, I remember\u2014\u201cJeffersonian games,\u201d you might call them\u2014the ad hoc captain of the side preparing to kick off would call out. \u201cAre you ready, Crispus Attucks?\u201d And the captain of the receivers would inevitably reply, \u201cWe are ready, Ladywood6.\u201d Come to think of it, that \u201cLadywood\u201d business had an anti-Catholic ring to it. Come to think of it, we were not only male and white, but also Protestant. So that \u201cLadywood\u201d insult was a kind of two-fer.\nIf I have offended some of you by speaking ill of Thomas Jefferson, tough titty for you. I can say anything I please, short of shouting \u201cFire!\u201d if there is no fire, because I am a citizen of the U.S.A. Your government does not exist and should not exist in order to keep you or anybody else, no matter what color, no matter what race, no matter what religion, from getting your damn fool feelings hurt.\nIf you found an official powerful enough and dumb enough to actually shut me up about Thomas Jefferson, the two of you would be hauled into court, and the Indiana Civil Liberties Union would make you both feel like something the cat drug in.\nWhich brings us to Saint Thomas Aquinas, a great Italian theologian and philosopher who eight hundred years ago perceived a hierarchy of laws which human beings should obey. At the top were God\u2019s Laws, from the Old and New Testaments, of course. Below them were Natural Laws, the ways Nature, obviously, to both Saint Thomas and Jefferson, expected things to go. Lowest of all were man\u2019s laws. If you think of laws arranged in that order in a deck of cards, God\u2019s Laws would be the aces, Nature\u2019s law would be the kings, and ACLU lawyers, attempting to secure the civil rights of the deuces and treys and even unpopular tens and jacks in our society, would have nothing but pipsqueak queens to play. I in fact once heard a man dismiss the Bill of Rights as \u201cnothing but a bunch of amendments.\u201d Chickenfeed, when compared with God and Nature.\nAnd indeed the unambiguous laws in the Bill of Rights might as well have been chickenfeed, or even chicken droppings, so cruelly spotty was their enforcement until the start of the lifetimes of people my age\u2014people born in 1922. Only a year before we were born were female citizens allowed to vote and run for office. My Lord! And for many years after that, until the end of World War II, for Heaven\u2019s sakes, African-American citizens of both sexes were in many parts of the country, this beacon of liberty, discouraged from voting by a combination of technicalities and sheer terror. Don\u2019t forget: Nobody had ever been punished for lynching one. \u201cNature red in tooth and claw7.\u201d\nWho were and are the bleeding hearts who fought and fight to make our governments, local, state and federal, behave justly and mercifully and respectfully toward all its citizens, no matter how socially and politically powerless and unpopular they may be? I have an old and once-despised name for them which may surprise you. They are \u201cAbolitionists.\u201d We are Abolitionists. Abolition of what? Of human slavery. Such passions for human rights as we have derive their strength from inherited guilt about the unspeakably hideous crime on which so much of the early and even present wealth of the whole of this nation, under God, is based, the labor of kidnapped persons, of slaves. And we tonight are also atoning as best we can for the murders of brothers by brothers, so to speak, in our Civil War. \u201cMine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. He is trampling out the vineyards where the grapes of wrath are stored.\u201d\nWhat did The Battle Hymn of the Republic and Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin and Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address and all that have to do with our present enthusiasm for women\u2019s rights?

another acknowledgment by people that their brains were no damn good?\n9\nWHILE ROY HEPBURN was dying, and while the whole city of Ilium was dying, for that matter, and while both the man and the city were being killed by growths inimical to a healthy and happy humanity, Roy\u2019s big brain persuaded him that he had been a sailor at the United States atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll, equatorial like Guayaquil, in 1946. He was going to sue his own government for millions, he said, because the radiation he had absorbed there had first prevented his and Mary\u2019s having children, and now it had caused his brain cancer.\nRoy had served a hitch in the Navy, but otherwise his case against the United States of America was a weak one, since he was born in 1932, and his country\u2019s lawyers would have no trouble proving that. That would make him fourteen years old at the time of his supposed exposure.\nThat anachronism did not prevent his having vivid memories of the terrible things his government had made him do to so-called lower animals. As he told it, he worked virtually unassisted, first driving stakes into the ground all over the atoll, and then tying different sorts of animals to the stakes. \u201cI guess they chose me,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause animals have always trusted me.\u201d\nThis much was true: Animals all trusted Roy. While he had no formal education past high school, except for the apprentice program at GEFFCo, and while Mary had a master\u2019s degree in zoology from Indiana University, Roy was much better at actually relating to animals than Mary was. He could talk to birds in their own languages, for example, something she could never have done, since her ancestors were notoriously tone deaf on both sides of her family. There was no dog or farm animal, not even a guard dog at GEFFCo or a sow with piglets, so vicious that Roy couldn\u2019t, within five minutes or less, turn it into a friend of his.\nSo Roy\u2019s tears were understandable when he remembered tying animals to all those stakes. Such a cruel experiment had been performed on animals, of course, on sheep and pigs and cattle and horses and monkeys and ducks and chickens and geese, but surely not on a zoo such as Roy described. To hear him tell it, he had tethered peacocks and snow leopards and gorillas and crocodiles and albatrosses to the stakes. In his big brain, Bikini became the exact reverse of Noah\u2019s ark. Two of every sort of animal had been brought there in order to be atom-bombed.\nThe craziest detail in his story, which did not seem at all crazy to him, of course, was this one: \u201cDonald was there.\u201d Donald was a golden retriever male who was roaming the neighborhood there in Ilium at that very moment, probably, maybe right outside the Hepburns\u2019 house, and was only four years old.\n\u201cIt was all very hard,\u201d Roy would say, \u201cbut the hardest part was tying Donald to one of those stakes. I kept putting it off until I couldn\u2019t put it off any longer. Tying Donald to a stake was the last thing I had to do.

Coming back to New York City after having been one of three persons at Father\u2019s funeral in San Ignacio, which I hadn\u2019t seen for five years, I ripped the photograph to bits. I did that because I was angry at my dead father. It was my conclusion that he had cheated himself and my mother a lot worse than they had been cheated by Vartan Mamigonian. It wasn\u2019t Mamigonian who made my parents stay in San Ignacio instead of moving to Fresno, say, where there really was an Armenian colony, whose members supported each other and kept the old language and customs and religion alive, and at the same time became happier and happier to be in California. Father could have become a beloved teacher again!\nOh, no\u2014it wasn\u2019t Mamigonian who tricked him into being the unhappiest and loneliest of all the world\u2019s cobblers.\nArmenians have done brilliantly in this country during the short time they\u2019ve been here. My neighbor to the west is F. Donald Kasabian, executive vice-president of Metropolitan Life\u2014so that right here in exclusive East Hampton, and right on the beach, too, we have two Armenians side by side. What used to be J. P. Morgan\u2019s estate in Southampton is now the property of Kevork Hovanessian, who also owned Twentieth Century-Fox until he sold it last week.\nAnd Armenians haven\u2019t succeeded only in business here. The great writer William Saroyan was an Armenian, and so is Dr. George Mintouchian, the new president of the University of Chicago. Dr. Mintouchian is a renowned Shakespeare scholar, something my father could have been.\nAnd Circe Berman has just come into the room and read what is in my typewriter, which is ten of the lines above. She is gone again. She said again that my father obviously suffered from Survivor\u2019s Syndrome.\n\u201cEverybody who is alive is a survivor, and everybody who is dead isn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cSo everybody alive must have the Survivor\u2019s Syndrome.

secretaries to Oliver P. Morton, the Governor of Indiana. The governor needed a German liaison secretary in his political activities. The pay was good and steady, and Peter remained in his office until the close of the war.\n\u201cIn 1865 came an opportunity for Peter. The leading brewery of the city was known as Gack & Biser\u2019s. Owing to death of the proprietors, the business was offered for sale. Peter bought it and renamed it P. Lieber & Co. Peter knew absolutely nothing of the brewery business, but he engaged a skilled brewmaster named Geiger who did, and proceeded to brew and sell Lieber\u2019s Beer. It was a successful venture from the very start. Peter gave his principal attention to sales, at which he became adept. This involved political activity and manipulation of saloon outlets.\n\u201cPeter was always involved in politics. He had to be in order to get saloon licenses for his favored customers. Until 1880 he was a staunch Republican, as all the Civil War veterans were. But in that year the Republicans, at the insistence of the Methodist Church, adopted a plank in their platform recommending a restraint upon the beer and liquor trade. It was the first stirring of Prohibition. This outraged Peter and was a threat to his interests. He promptly changed his politics and was thereafter a Democrat\u2014and an aggressive, active one.\n\u201cHe contributed generously to Grover Cleveland\u2019s Campaign Funds, particularly in 1892, when Cleveland was elected President for the second time. He was rewarded by being appointed Consul General of the United States to Dusseldorf in 1893.\u201d\nPeter Lieber sold his brewery to a British syndicate, which was eager to have Peter\u2019s oldest son, my grandfather Albert, run it for them.\nPeter returned to Germany in 1893, where he bought a castle on the Rhine near Dusseldorf. He took with him President Cleveland\u2019s commission as Consul General of the United States to Dusseldorf. Uncle John says, \u201cHe hoisted the Stars and Stripes over his castle, delegated his negligible duties to subordinates, and finished his days in opulence and official grandeur.\u201d\nHis son Albert, who never went to college, stayed in Indianapolis and ran the brewery, and went to London once a year to report to its new owners.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSo there\u2014Uncle John has now accounted for four of my great-grandparents, those who brought my mother\u2019s maiden name, Lieber, and my father\u2019s name, Vonnegut, into this country when there was still much wilderness. Four more great-grandparents and four grandparents and two parents must still be described.\nLet me say now that the ancestor who most beguiles me is Clemens Vonnegut, who died by the side of the road.", 0.2015151515151515], "title": "Palm Sunday"}, "while-mortals-sleep": {"tfidf": [["insurance", 0.10910823207178988], ["everett", 0.10910823207178988], ["dr", 0.0960525757038528], ["millikan",

The general population and the press, long inured to a world gone mad, had not yet noticed that affairs had recently become even worse. The news was full of death. The news had always been full of death. It was the life insurance companies that noticed first what was going on, and well they might have. They had insured millions of lives at rates based on a life expectancy of sixty-eight years. Now, in a six-month period, the average age at death for married American males with more than twenty thousand dollars in life insurance had dropped to an appalling forty-seven years.\n\u201cDropped to forty-seven years\u2014and still dropping,\u201d said the president of the American Reliable and Equitable Life and Casualty Company of Connecticut. The president himself was only forty-six, very young to be heading the eighth-largest insurance company in the country. He was a humorless, emaciated, ambitious young man who had been described by the previous president as \u201cgruesomely capable.\u201d His name was Millikan.\nThe previous president, who had been kicked upstairs to chairmanship of the board of directors, was with Millikan now in the company\u2019s boardroom in Hartford. He was an amiable old gentleman, a lifelong bachelor named Breed.\nThe third person present was Dr. Everett, a young epidemiologist from the United States Department of Health and Welfare. It was Dr. Everett who gave the plague a name that stuck. He called it \u201cthe epizootic.\u201d \u201cWhen you say forty-seven years\u2014\u201d he said to Millikan, \u201cis that an exact figure?\u201d\n\u201cWe happen to be somewhat short of exact figures just now,\u201d said Millikan wryly. \u201cOur chief actuary killed himself two days ago\u2014threw himself out his office window.\u201d\n\u201cFamily man?\u201d said Dr. Everett.\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d said the chairman of the board. \u201cAnd his family is very nicely taken care of now, thanks to life insurance. His debts can all be paid off, his wife is assured an adequate income for life, and his children can go to college without having to work their ways through.\u201d The old man said all this with sad, plonking irony. \u201cInsurance is a wonderful thing,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially after it\u2019s been in effect for more than two years.\u201d He meant by that that most life insurance contracts paid off on suicide after they had been in effect for more than two years. \u201cNo family man,\u201d he said, \u201cshould be without it.\u201d\n\u201cDid he leave a note?\u201d said Dr. Everett.\n\u201cHe left two,\u201d said the chairman. \u201cOne was to us, suggesting that we replace him with a Gypsy fortune-teller. The other was to his wife and children, and it said simply, \u201cI love you more than anything. I have done this so you can have all the things you deserve.\u201d He winked ruefully at Dr. Everett, the country\u2019s outstanding authority on the epizootic. \u201cI daresay such sentiments are quite familiar to you by now.\u201d\nDr. Everett nodded. \u201cAs familiar as chicken pox to a pediatrician,\u201d he said tiredly.", 0.11822935234699941], "title": "While Mortals Sleep"}, "slapstick": {"tfidf": [["plague", 0.17977304773081612], ["island", 0.095538924009189], ["write", 0.09031347723538362], ["peculiar", 0.08988652386540806], ["continental", 0.08988652386540806], ["boats", 0.08988652386540806], ["closet", 0.08988652386540806], ["independence", 0.08988652386540806], ["ball", 0.08988652386540806], ["gross", 0.08988652386540806], ["visitors", 0.08988652386540806], ["boxes", 0.08988652386540806], ["declaration", 0.08988652386540806], ["driving", 0.08988652386540806], ["sobriquet", 0.08988652386540806], ["thomas", 0.07813826656778187], ["modern", 0.07813826656778187], ["hiccup", 0.07813826656778187], ["pens", 0.07813826656778187], ["senile", 0.07813826656778187], ["stationery", 0.07813826656778187], ["crushed", 0.07813826656778187], ["rare", 0.07813826656778187], ["jefferson", 0.07813826656778187], ["earned", 0.07813826656778187], ["fear", 0.07126597659984688], ["bridges", 0.07126597659984688], ["fourth", 0.07126597659984688], ["mainland", 0.07126597659984688], ["tunnels", 0.07126597659984688], ["sixty", 0.06639000927015568], ["death", 0.06336670181606541], ["lived", 0.056904995915318], ["ho", 0.05220197232422139], ["point", 0.05085965788245813], ["kind", 0.05085965788245813], ["book", 0.0477694620045945], ["manhattan", 0.046412805942331166], ["school", 0.04515673861769181], ["green", 0.04515673861769181], ["days", 0.043987367914523144], ["isadore", 0.0428934946749033], ["floor", 0.04186595871191287], ["vera", 0.04089717203665951], ["times", 0.03998077845580738], ["melody", 0.03749597380848746], ["called", 0.03749597380848746], ["three", 0.036021204706968304], ["thing", 0.03532930649476059], ["long", 0.031683350908032704], ["day", 0.02962638722999427], ["will", 0.027363143287205748], ["told", 0.02499429680627086]], "sentiment": ["\u201cVera\u2014\u201d I told her the other day, \u201cif you would only write us a new Declaration of Independence, you would be the Thomas Jefferson of modern times.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI write this book on the stationery of the Continental Driving School, three boxes of which Melody and Isadore found in a closet on the sixty-fourth floor of our home.

Rockefeller, as it happened\u2014\" said the Senator, \"and she confessed to me that she spent the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth years of her life saying nothing but, 'No, thank you.' Which is all very well for a girl of that age and station. But it would have been a damned unattractive trait in a male Rockefeller, and an even more unsuitable one, if I may say so, in a male Rosewater.\"\nHe shrugged. \"Be that as it may, we do now have a male Rosewater who says 'No' to all the good things life would like to give him. He won't even live in the mansion any more.\" Eliot had moved out of the mansion and into an office when it became clear that Sylvia was never coming back to him.\n\"He could have been Governor of Indiana by lifting an eyebrow, could have been President of the United States, even, at the price of a few beads of sweat. And what is he? I ask you, what is he?\"\nThe Senator coughed again, then answered his own question: \"A notary public, friends and neighbors, whose commission is about to expire.\"\nThis was fairly true. The only official document that hung on the mildewed beaverboard wall of Eliot's busy office was his commission as a notary public. So many of the people who brought their troubles to him needed, among such a multitude of other things, someone to witness their signatures.\nEliot's office was on Main Street, a block north-east of the brick Parthenon, across the street from the new firehouse, which the Rosewater Foundation had built. It was a shotgun attic that spanned a lunchroom and a liquor store. There were only two windows, in doghouse dormers. Outside of one was a sign that said, EATS. Outside the other was a sign that said, BEER. Both signs were electrified and equipped with blinkers. And, as Eliot's father ranted in Washington about him, him, him, Eliot slept like a baby, and the signs blinked off and on.\nEliot made of his mouth a Cupid's bow, murmured something sweetly, turned over, snored. He was an athlete gone to lard, a big man, six-feet-three, two hundred thirty pounds, pale, balding on all sides of a wispy scalplock. He was swaddled in the elephant wrinkles of war-surplus long underwear.

He was asked to say grace. He discovered then that he had become a bubbling booby, that his stammer was so bad now that he could not speak at all.\nHe would never go to the factory again. He would become Cleveland\u2019s leading art collector and the chief donor to the Cleveland Museum of Fine Arts, demonstrating that the McCone family was interested in more than money and power for money\u2019s and power\u2019s sakes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHis stammer was so bad for the rest of his life that he seldom ventured outside his mansion on Euclid Avenue. He had married a Rockefeller one month before his stammer became so bad. Otherwise, as he would later say, he would probably never have married at all.\nHe had one daughter, who was embarrassed by him, as was his wife. He would make only one friendship after the Massacre. It would be with a child. It would be with the son of his cook and his chauffeur.\nThe multimillionaire wanted someone who would play chess with him many hours a day. So he seduced the boy, so to speak, with simpler games first\u2014hearts and old maid, checkers and dominoes. But he also taught him chess. Soon they were playing only chess. Their conversations were limited to conventional chess taunts and teasings, which had not changed in a thousand years.\nSamples: \u201cHave you played this game before?\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cSpot me a queen.\u201d \u201cIs this a trap?\u201d\nThe boy was Walter F.

Or if the sun comes out, maybe I\u2019ll go for a walk through one of the gorges. Aren\u2019t the gorges beautiful? This year, two girls jumped into one holding hands. They didn\u2019t get into the sorority they wanted. They wanted Tri-Delt.\n\u201cBut back to August 6, 1945. My sister Angela has told me many times that I really hurt my father that day when I wouldn\u2019t admire the cat\u2019s cradle, when I wouldn\u2019t stay there on the carpet with my father and listen to him sing. Maybe I did hurt him, but I don\u2019t think I could have hurt him much. He was one of the best-protected human beings who ever lived. People couldn\u2019t get at him because he just wasn\u2019t interested in people. I remember one time, about a year before he died, I tried to get him to tell me something about my mother. He couldn\u2019t remember anything about her.\n\u201cDid you ever hear the famous story about breakfast on the day Mother and Father were leaving for Sweden to accept the Nobel Prize? It was in The Saturday Evening Post one time. Mother cooked a big breakfast. And then, when she cleared off the table, she found a quarter and a dime and three pennies by Father\u2019s coffee cup. He\u2019d tipped her.\n\u201cAfter wounding my father so terribly, if that\u2019s what I did, I ran out into the yard. I didn\u2019t know where I was going until I found my brother Frank under a big spiraea bush. Frank was twelve then, and I wasn\u2019t surprised to find him under there. He spent a lot of time under there on hot days. Just like a dog, he\u2019d make a hollow in the cool earth all around the roots. And you never could tell what Frank would have under the bush with him. One time he had a dirty book. Another time he had a bottle of cooking sherry. On the day they dropped the bomb Frank had a tablespoon and a Mason jar. What he was doing was spooning different kinds of bugs into the jar and making them fight.\n\u201cThe bug fight was so interesting that I stopped crying right away\u2014forgot all about the old man. I can\u2019t remember what all Frank had fighting in the jar that day, but I can remember other bug fights we staged later on: one stag beetle against a hundred red ants, one centipede against three spiders, red ants against black ants. They won\u2019t fight unless you keep shaking the jar. And that\u2019s what Frank was doing, shaking, shaking the jar.\n\u201cAfter a while Angela came looking for me. She lifted up one side of the bush and she said, \u2018So there you are!\u2019 She asked Frank what he thought he was doing, and he said, \u2018Experimenting.\u2019 That\u2019s what Frank always used to say when people asked him what he thought he was doing. He always said, \u2018Experimenting.\u2019\n\u201cAngela was twenty-two then. She had been the real head of the family since she was sixteen, since Mother died, since I was born. She used to talk about how she had three children\u2014me, Frank, and Father. She wasn\u2019t exaggerating, either. I can remember cold mornings when Frank, Father, and I would be all in a line in the front hall, and Angela would be bundling us up, treating us exactly the same. Only I was going to kindergarten; Frank was going to junior high; and Father was going to work on the atom bomb. I remember one morning like that when the oil burner had quit, the pipes were frozen, and the car wouldn\u2019t start. We all sat there in the car while Angela kept pushing the starter until the battery was dead. And then Father spoke up. You know what he said? He said, \u2018I wonder about turtles.\u2019 \u2018What do you wonder about turtles?\u2019 Angela asked him. \u2018When they pull in their heads,\u2019 he said, \u2018do their spines buckle or contract?\u2019\n\u201cAngela was one of the unsung heroines of the atom bomb, incidentally, and I don\u2019t think the story has ever been told. Maybe you can use it. After the turtle incident, Father got so interested in turtles that he stopped working on the atom bomb. Some people from the Manhattan Project finally came out to the house to ask Angela what to do. She told them to take away Father\u2019s turtles. So one night they went into his laboratory and stole the turtles and the aquarium. Father never said a word about the disappearance of the turtles. He just came to work the next day and looked for things to play with and think about, and everything there was to play with and think about had something to do with the bomb.\n\u201cWhen Angela got me out from under the bush, she asked me what had happened between Father and me. I just kept saying over and over again how ugly he was, how much I hated him. So she slapped me. \u2018How dare you say that about your father?\u2019 she said. \u2018He\u2019s one of the greatest men who ever lived! He won the war today! Do you realize that? He won the war!\u2019 She slapped me again.\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame Angela for slapping me. Father was all she had. She didn\u2019t have any boy friends. She didn\u2019t have any friends at all. She had only one hobby. She played the clarinet.", 0.03058652729384436], "title": "Cat's Cradle"}, "player-piano": {"tfidf": [["bartender", 0.11228413457496118], ["dog", 0.067422010697964], ["displaced",

Within a week of the opening, curiosity had been satisfied, and it was a boom day when five customers stopped in. Then this place had opened up almost next door, with a dust-and-germ trap of a Victorian bar, bad light, poor ventilation, and an unsanitary, inefficient, and probably dishonest bartender. It was an immediate and unflagging success.\nHe caught the bartender\u2019s eye at last. When the bartender saw Paul, he dropped his role of high-handed supervisor of morals and settler of arguments and became an obsequious host, like the bartender at the Country Club. Paul was afraid for a moment that he\u2019d been recognized. But when the bartender failed to call him by name, he supposed that only his class had been recognized.\nThere were a few men in Homestead\u2014like this bartender, the police and firemen, professional athletes, cab drivers, specially skilled artisans\u2014who hadn\u2019t been displaced by machines. They lived among those who had been displaced, but they were aloof and often rude and overbearing with the mass. They felt a camaraderie with the engineers and managers across the river, a feeling that wasn\u2019t, incidentally, reciprocated. The general feeling across the river was that these persons weren\u2019t too bright to be replaced by machines; they were simply in activities where machines weren\u2019t economical. In short, their feelings of superiority were unjustified.\nNow, the bartender had sensed that Paul was a personage, and he made a show of letting everyone else go to hell while he gave service to Paul. The others noticed, and turned to stare at the privileged newcomer.\nPaul ordered the bottle of Irish in a quiet voice, and tried to become inconspicuous by bending over and petting the aged collie. The dog barked, and its owner turned on his barstool to confront Paul. The old man was as toothless as the dog. Paul\u2019s first impression was of red gums and huge hands\u2014as though everything were sapped of color and strength but these.\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t hurt nobody,\u201d said the old man apologetically. \u201cJust kind of edgy about being old and blind, and never sure of what\u2019s going on, is all.\u201d He ran his big hands along the dog\u2019s fat sides. \u201cHe\u2019s a good old dog.\u201d He looked thoughtfully at Paul. \u201cSay, I bet I know you.\u201d\nPaul looked anxiously after the bartender, who had disappeared into the cellar after the whisky. \u201cReally? I\u2019ve been in here once or twice before.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not here,\u201d said the old man loudly. \u201cThe plant, the plant. You\u2019re young Doctor Proteus.\u201d\nA lot of people heard, and those closest to the two studied Paul with disturbing candor, and fell silent in order to hear whatever was being said.\nThe old man was apparently quite deaf, for his voice was erratically loud, then soft. \u201cDon\u2019t recognize my face, Doctor?\u201d He wasn\u2019t mocking, he was frankly admiring, and proud that he could prove himself on speaking terms with this distinguished man.", 0.04897959183673472], "title": "Player Piano"}, "look-at-the-birdie": {"tfidf": [["fuzz", 0.1525645729553504], ["company",

company gym.\nOne nice thing, anyway\u2014nobody could use the gym facilities except on weekends and after five in the afternoon, so Fuzz didn\u2019t have to put up with people swimming and bowling and dancing and playing basketball around him while he was trying to work. Sounds of playfulness would have been not only distracting but almost too mocking to bear. Fuzz, caring for his sick mother, had never had time to play in all his fubar days.\nAnother nice thing was that Fuzz had finally achieved the rank of supervisor. He was so isolated out in the gym that he couldn\u2019t borrow anybody else\u2019s typist. Fuzz had to have a girl all his own.\nNow Fuzz was sitting in his new office, listening to the showerheads dribble on the other side of the wall and waiting for the new girl to arrive.\nIt was nine o\u2019clock in the morning.\nFuzz jumped. He heard the great, echoing ka-boom of the entrance door slamming shut upstairs. He assumed that the new girl had entered the building, since not another soul in the world had any business there.\nIt was not necessary for Fuzz to guide the new girl across the basketball court, past the bowling alleys, down the iron stairway, and over the duckboards to his office door. The buildings and grounds people had marked the way with arrows, each arrow bearing the legend GENERAL COMPANY RESPONSE SECTION, PUBLIC RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.\nFuzz had been the General Company Response Section of the Public Relations Department during his entire fubar career with the company. As that section he wrote replies to letters that were addressed simply to the General Forge and Foundry Company at large, letters that couldn\u2019t logically be referred to any company operation in particular. Half the letters didn\u2019t even make sense. But no matter how foolish and rambling the letters might be, it was Fuzz\u2019s duty to reply to them warmly, to prove what the Public Relations Department proved tirelessly\u2014that the General Forge and Foundry Company had a heart as big as all outdoors.\nNow the footsteps of Fuzz\u2019s new girl were coming down the stairway cautiously. She didn\u2019t have much faith in what the arrows said, apparently. Her steps were hesitant, were sometimes light enough to be on tiptoe.\nThere was the sound of a door opening, and the open door loosed a swarm of tinny, nightmarish little echoes. The girl had made a false turn, then, had mistakenly opened the door to the swimming pool.", 0.06924302549302548], "title": "Look at the Birdie"}, "hocus-pocus": {"tfidf": [["moderation",

Canada is a foreign country.\nBut then I heard myself spinning this fantastic tale of their being on a safari in Tanganyika, a place about which I know almost nothing. I told that woman, and she believed me, that my parents and their guide were shot by poachers who were killing elephants for their ivory and mistook them for game wardens. I said that the poachers put their bodies on top of anthills, so that their skeletons were soon picked clean. They could be positively identified only by their dental work.\nI used to find it easy and even exhilarating to lie that elaborately. I don\u2019t anymore. And I wonder now if I didn\u2019t develop that unwholesome habit very young, and because my parents were such an embarrassment, and especially my mother, who was fat enough to be a circus freak. I described much more attractive parents than I really had, in order to make people who knew nothing about them think well of me.\nAnd during my final year in Vietnam, when I was in Public Information, I found it as natural as breathing to tell the press and replacements fresh off the boats or planes that we were clearly winning, and that the folks back home should be proud and happy about all the good things we were doing there.\nI learned to lie like that in high school.\nANOTHER THING I learned in high school that was helpful in Vietnam: Alcohol and marijuana, if used in moderation, plus loud, usually low-class music, make stress and boredom infinitely more bearable. It was manna from Heaven that I came into this world with a gift for moderation in my intake of mood-modifying substances. During my last 2 years in high school, I don\u2019t think my parents even suspected that I was half in the bag a lot of the time. All they ever complained about was the music, when I played the radio or the phonograph or when The Soul Merchants rehearsed in our basement, which Mom and Dad said was jungle music, and much too loud.\nIn Vietnam, the music was always much too loud. Practically everybody was half in the bag, including Chaplains. Several of the most gruesome accidents I had to explain to the press during my last year over there were caused by people who had rendered themselves imbecilic or maniacal by ingesting too much of what, if taken in moderation, could be a helpful chemical. I ascribed all such accidents, of course, to human error. The press understood. Who on this Earth hasn\u2019t made a mistake or 2?\nTHE ASSASSINATION OF an Austrian archduke led to World War I, and probably to World War II as well. Just as surely, my father\u2019s black eye brought me to the sorry state in which I find myself today. He was looking for some way, almost any way, to recapture the respect of the community, and to attract favorable attention from Barrytron\u2019s new owner, Du Pont. Du Pont, of course, has now been taken over by I. G.

The listless and heartsick survivors were showered this time with leaflets. I lost my copy of the epic, but remember that it ran something like this: \u201cTo the people of Dresden: We were forced to bomb your city because of the heavy military traffic your railroad facilities have been carrying. We realize that we haven\u2019t always hit our objectives. Destruction of anything other than military objectives was unintentional, unavoidable fortunes of war.\u201d That explained the slaughter to everyone\u2019s satisfaction, I am sure, but it aroused no little contempt for the American bomb-sight. It is a fact that forty-eight hours after the last B-17 had droned west for a well-earned rest, labor battalions had swarmed over the damaged rail yards and restored them to nearly normal service. None of the rail bridges over the Elbe was knocked out of commission. Bomb-sight manufacturers should blush to know that their marvelous devices laid bombs down as much as three miles wide of what the military claimed to be aiming for. The leaflet should have said, \u201cWe hit every blessed church, hospital, school, museum, theater, your university, the zoo, and every apartment building in town, but we honestly weren\u2019t trying hard to do it. C\u2019est la guerre. So sorry. Besides, saturation bombing is all the rage these days, you know.\u201d\nThere was tactical significance: stop the railroads. An excellent maneuver, no doubt, but the technique was horrible. The planes started kicking high-explosives and incendiaries through their bomb-bays at the city limits, and for all the pattern their hits presented, they must have been briefed by a Ouija board. Tabulate the loss against the gain. Over one hundred thousand non-combatants and a magnificent city destroyed by bombs dropped wide of the stated objectives: the railroads were knocked out for roughly two days. The Germans counted it the greatest loss of life suffered in any single raid. The death of Dresden was a bitter tragedy, needlessly and willfully executed. The killing of children\u2014\u201cJerry\u201d children or \u201cJap\u201d children, or whatever enemies the future may hold for us\u2014can never be justified.\nThe facile reply to great groans such as mine is the most hateful of all clich\u00e9s, \u201cfortunes of war,\u201d and another, \u201cThey asked for it. All they understand is force.\u201d Who asked for it? The only thing who understands is force? Believe me, it is not easy to rationalize the stamping out of vineyards where the grapes of wrath are stored when gathering up babies in bushel baskets or helping a man dig where he thinks his wife may be buried. Certainly enemy military and industrial installations should have been blown flat, and woe unto those foolish enough to seek shelter near them. But the \u201cGet Tough America\u201d policy, the spirit of revenge, the approbation of all destruction and killing, has earned us a name for obscene brutality, and cost the World the possibility of Germany\u2019s becoming a peaceful and intellectually fruitful nation in anything but the most remote future.\nOur leaders had a carte blanche as to what they might or might not destroy. Their mission was to win the war as quickly as possible, and, while they were admirably trained to do just that, their decisions as to the fate of certain priceless World heirlooms\u2014in one case Dresden\u2014were not always judicious. When, late in the war, with the Wehrmacht breaking up on all fronts, our planes were sent to destroy this last major city, I doubt if the question was asked, \u201cHow will this tragedy benefit us, and how will that benefit compare with the ill-effects in the long run?\u201d Dresden, a beautiful city, built in the art spirit, symbol of an admirable heritage, so anti-Nazi that Hitler visited it but twice during his whole reign, food and hospital center so bitterly needed now\u2014plowed under and salt strewn in the furrows.\nThere can be no doubt that the Allies fought on the side of right and the Germans and Japanese on the side of wrong. World War II was fought for near-Holy motives. But I stand convinced that the brand of justice in which we dealt, wholesale bombings of civilian populations, was blasphemous. That the enemy did it first has nothing to do with the moral problem. What I saw of our air war, as the European conflict neared an end, had the earmarks of being an irrational war for war\u2019s sake. Soft citizens of the American democracy learned to kick a man below the belt and make the bastard scream.\nThe occupying Russians, when they discovered that we were Americans, embraced us and congratulated us on the complete desolation our planes had wrought. We accepted their congratulations with good grace and proper modesty, but I felt then as I feel now, that I would have given my life to save Dresden for the World\u2019s generations to come. That is how everyone should feel about every city on Earth.\nGreat Day\nWhen I was sixteen folks took me for twenty-five, and one full-growed woman from the city swore I must be thirty. I was big all over\u2014had whiskers like steel wool.
