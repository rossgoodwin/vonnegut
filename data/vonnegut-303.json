It was shaped by seemingly innocent questions put to me by Jill during the past year. How much did I like this person or that one, and so on. I must have spoken well of you two. Sometimes I make good sense.\nThe party scared the pants off me, just as a similarly orchestrated hallucination would have scared the pants off anybody, I think. The particular danger it represented to me was that I would become (1.) intolerably drunk, (2.) intolerably exhibitionistic, and (3.) intolerably sentimental. I fought off the booze, but I did become the loud and mawkish birthday boy. Since then, I have tried to be as much like Edith Piaf as possible, regretting nothing, and one excess of sentimentality which I genuinely fail to regret is my trying to thank you, Miller, for having been such a good teacher of the liberal arts and the craft of writing at Cornell. Back in the old days, you, although only a year older than myself, were in loco parentis, as far as I was concerned. You carried off that responsibility with utmost kindness and wisdom and flattering watchfulness.\nYes\u2014I did receive the shirts, which are beautifully made. Really. That much is still right about this country anyway\u2014Eagle Shirts. We also still make the finest harps in the world.\nMuch love to both of you.

And that\u2019s what the radio was bawling about when the old blue Ford stopped beneath the porte cochere of the Governor\u2019s Mansion.\nOnly one person came out to greet them, and that was the policeman who guarded the door. \u201cCongratulations, sir \u2026 madam,\u201d he said blandly.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Rice.
